0,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/769943-molly,1,"This is what happens when you take an intelligent person, and casually make a few mentions of a field of study they have no knowledge of.Mr. Diamond, NOT an anthropologist, takes Marvin Harris' theory of cultural materialism and uses it to explain everything in life, history, and the current state of the world.Materialism is a way of looking at human culture which, for lack of a better way to explain it easily here, says that people's material needs and goods determine behavior and culture. For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation. As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure."
1,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"[Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions."

“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups?The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book.

3,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77981-mike-shapiro,4,"Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind. "
4,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"It took me a while to complete Diamond's book (and admittedly I also distracted myself with a few Roth novels in the meantime) because of the density of the text and the variety of ideas presented. The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit."
5,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,1,"Terrible. This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid."
6,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/954317-nate,1,"This may be the most over-rated book in the history of book rating. The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals. Of course he is mostly right, but why in the 21st century is this considered such a novel idea, and why does he have to be so BORING about it? Don't believe the hype."

حلقه ی بازخورد مثبت آن‌ها را، تقویت می‌کند (به این معنا که برتری محیطی، باعث پیشرفت تکنولوژی می‌شود، و برتری تکنولوژی، باعث پیشرفت‌های بیشتری می‌شوند، که در جای خود پیشرفت بیشتری نیز به دنبال می‌آورد)؛ در مواردی که تفاوت‌های فرهنگی، یا ژنتیکی، به نفع اورآسیایی‌ها عمل کرده‌ است (به عنوان مثال دولت متمرکز در چین، یا مقاومت ژنتیکی در برابر بسیاری بیماری‌ها در میان اورآسیای‌ها)، این مزیت‌ها تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری (علمی، هنری، معماری، سیاسی، و غیره) در قاره اورآسیا رخ داده‌

فوق‌العاده (اشاره به بومیان آمریکا، بومیان استرالیا و بومیان خوآسان جنوب آفریقا) عمدتاً از بین رفته‌ اندبرهان نخست این سلطه ی اوراسیائی‌ها، برتری‌های نظامی و سیاسی آن‌ها بوده، که خود ناشی از پیدایش زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ دایموند در این کتاب برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به راههایی که به وسیله آن‌ها، اروپایی‌ها علی‌رغم تعداد نفرات کمتر، ملتهای دیگر را مغلوب کرده) و سلطهٔ خود را حفظ کرده‌ اند، سلاح‌های برتر مستقیماً منجر به برتری نظامی می‌شوند (اسلحه)؛ بیماری‌های اروپایی

مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی آمریکا را ویران کردند؛ اوراسیا پس از آخرین عصر یخ شانس برخورداری از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی و زیست‌ محیطی را دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی اوراسیا را دلایل اصلی توسعه زودهنگام کشاورزی در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند بز، سگ یا بزرگتر) در طبیعت اوراسیا یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را اختیار مبتکران اروپایی و آسیایی کشاورزی و به خصوص اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً بین‌النهرین و ترکیه) گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی عامل پر اهمیتتربود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر اوراسیا در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردم اورآسیا به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط اوراسیا اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی آمریکا، و تا حدی آفریقا، به دلیل تنوع گسترده در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز آفریقا، یا آمریکا قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، سرخپوستان ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله بر خلاف غلات اوراسیا، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، مه کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است ذکر شود که پس از آنکه به عنوان مثال در تمدن می.سی.سی.پی در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد. چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در اورآسیا یافت می‌شده‌ است) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری همچون موز، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای آفریقا عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، اورآسیا بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد: اسب و شتر که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، بز و گوسفند برای پوست، پوشاک، و پنیر؛ گاو برای شیر و ورزا برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند خوک‌ها، و مرغ برای خوردن. آفریقایی‌ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با شیر، پلنگ و امثالهم طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تنها جانورانی مفید برای استفاده بشر در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق آسیا آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، و هنگام گسترش استرانیزی به گینه نو وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب دایموند اجمالاً به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب اروپا، و نه آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین) بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب آسیا، دایموند پاسخ پریسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب آسیا را بسیار خشک و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز اروپا، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق آسیا، دایموند حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با ثبات و جدا افتاده‌ ای شد، که هیچ فشار خارجی قابل توجهی، آن را تهدید نمی‌کرده‌ است؛ این امر باعث تمرکز بیش از حد تصمیم‌گیری شده، و نوعی خودکامگی بی‌رقابت را، ایجاد کرده‌ است، که خود پس از مدتی، منجر به ایستایی جامعه، و در مواردی (مانند اختراع اسلحه و کشتی‌های اقیانوس پیما) سرکوب تکنولوژی از سوی حاکمان شده‌ است؛ در اروپا وجود موانع طبیعی بسیار (مانند کوه‌های عظیم و خلیجها) منجر به ایجاد دول ملی محلی رقیب شد؛ این رقابت

10,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852363-joshua-parkinson,4,"In 1532, Francisco Pizarro and a band of 168 Spaniards punctured the heart of the Inca Empire and proceeded to capture its emperor, decimate its citizens, and plunder its gold. Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance."
11,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Jared sticks to the basic premise and plugs every hole in his argument so well to construct a magnificent explanation of the evolution of societies. What makes the book particularly good is the intimate hands-on experience that Jared has on the wide variety of fields required to attempt a book like this. The last four or five chapters start to get very repetitive, but except for that Diamond has taken a stunningly large scale view of history that keeps you enthralled throughout the 13,000 years we cover in this book. "
12,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198340-jim,5,"The PuristI give you now Professor Twist,A conscientious scientist,Trustees exclaimed, ""He never bungles!""And sent him off to distant jungles.Camped on a tropic riverside,One day he missed his loving bride.She had, the guide informed him later,Been eaten by an alligator.Professor Twist could not but smile.""You mean,"" he said, ""a crocodile.""That bit of Ogden Nash whimsy came into my head as I thought about Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, a reflection on human history through the lens of evolutionary biology. Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."
13,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"Diamond attempts to ""provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years,"" AND answer the question of why some cultures thrive while others perish or are conquered by others. There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic."

15,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“In short, Europe’s colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume. Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work."
16,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies. "

18,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to ""favor"" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. "
19,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,4,"Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended."
20,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113897-rhiannon,2,"I have this awesome picture in my head in which Jared Diamond did not write this book. He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome."
21,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read. "
22,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,1,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space."

But this book gave me so much more than that, it gave me answers or some revelations about some of my personal thinking all these years.I cannot comment much about the contents, there are a lot of reviews that describe the contents well.Some interesting points on this book for me:1. In my opinion, this book has pristine description the 1966 revolution in Indonesia.2. This book has interesting theory of the losing of China vs. European since 15th century.3. I found the epilogue is reminding me some with Asimov’s psychohistory, with chapter title: “THE FUTURE OF HUMAN HISTORY AS A SCIENCE”. For people who had read Foundation, please try the epilogue of this book.There is at least one hint about a leading civilization destroying its own environment… but it is another story. Mr. Diamond described this idea on his next book, Collapse."
24,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL: THE FATES OF HUMAN SOCIETIES BY JARED DIAMOND: This is one of those books that takes you a while to read -- it's pretty heavy non-fiction -- and yet at the end of it, you feel like Hippocrates, a Muslim scientist, or Leonardo Da Vinci must have felt at the realization of a great discovery. The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: ""Oh, that's how that happened,"" or ""that's why it's like that."" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way.

It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose in the end this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suppose that each individual can make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually."

Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it’s no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to “an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable.” (p. 408).To Diamond’s great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).“Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia’s having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.” (p. 163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.“The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia’s Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world’s 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.” (p. 139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.The Invisible AllyFor all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of human history: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.Closing ThoughtsOne of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, GGS is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography.If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. GGS makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
28,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF EVERYbody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?...Diamond immediately takes great pains to shoot down any ideas of one race being more intelligent than another. Yes, some thought so, but they've been refuted for long enough that I thought he belabored the point. This section does introduce us to his method of argument which is to set up straw men & knock them down. I don't care for it much since the questions aren't always honest or complete.Eurasia is an iffy area for Diamond's purposes. It often includes northern Africa, but generally not eastern Asia or northern Europe. This makes sense in the context of the plant & animal species available to the humans of the time. Eurasia had the most species of both that could readily be domesticated. Of all the plants, only a few were readily domesticated. In Eurasia, the number made for a critical mass which led to earlier civilization. Giving up hunter-gatherer often isn't an advantage to individuals, but is to the tribes/clans as a whole. More food reserves, more specialization (leaders, soldiers, farmers), better able & pressure to compete & share discoveries.It's amazing how few plants & animals can be domesticated - only 14 large animals by his count. There isn't that much megafauna (animals generally averaging over 100 lbs) that early man didn't wipe out & most of those evolved with man. They survived because they learned early & well to fear & avoid or live with us. In almost every case where they didn't, such as in Australia & the Americas, they went extinct shortly after we showed up. Successful domestication is based on the Anna Karenina Syndrome, a name given due to the first line of the novel.Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.IOW, a happy family has many things right while it only takes one of any number of things to make an unhappy one. Plants & animals must have everything right to become domesticated, especially early on. Wheat needed very little modification & we domesticated it (or vice versa) very early while we still don't domesticate oaks because they take so long to mature, breeding characteristics*, & it's so hard to economically pick their acorns due to their size & competition with other animals.(* A complex of genes controls tannin production, so it's very difficult to breed a non-bitter acorn. If only 1 gene were in control, we might have domesticated them (pecans) even if it were a recessive one. Oaks just had too many things wrong.)The proximity to animals & each other also led to more disease. The originating groups of humans survived with immunity, but when they met another group without similar immunity, the new group was often wiped out. Obvious examples are the natives of the Americas & the spread by Europeans of small pox & other diseases.Eurasia also had the most contiguous land along generally the same latitude. This helped spread domesticated plants, animals, diseases, & ideas. North to south, like sub-Saharan Africa or Mexico to South America, is a problem since temperature, hours of daylight, & general climate varies too greatly for many plants & animals to survive a slow expansion across them. While humans could adapt to environments from desert to jungle, their plants, animals, inventions, & diseases often couldn't/didn't.Different environments also slowed humans so not only weren't inventions spread, but there wasn't the pressure to develop/adopt new methods or die. Sub-Saharan Africa is considered an entirely separate area, almost a continent of its own, from northern Africa in terms of evolution. Australia, New Zealand, & Tasmania were all distinct from the rest of the world & even each other.So, the answer to the central question is civilizations developed differently due to their environments:1) The number & variety of plants & animals that were available to domesticate.2) The ease of diffusion & migration within the continent & 3) between continents.4) Continental population size.He really should add a 5th - plain luck. As he points out, in the early 15th century, China was ready to explore the world, but political infighting in their unified government killed the exploration party almost a century before Columbus set out. While Columbus was originally turned down, he had multiple governments to try, one of which eventually opened the doors to expansion which led to many of them - all European - competing around the globe to grab the prizes.The audio edition of this book is abridged, although I hadn't realized that when I started listening & it sure seemed long enough.

His synopsis & maunderings in the beginning are interesting only from a historic point of view, although he seems to pretty much have the basics right, so it doesn't invalidate his later conclusions. It does stretch that section out a lot, though. It's cool to see how well a different science has nailed down so many questions & in such a short time.Overall, very good, but a bit dated & long. Grover Gardner did a great job reading this & I'd suggest the abridged version backed by a book since the maps help & reading more in some areas was good."

Well told tale. Persuasive, goodness knows. Maybe even partially correct, who knows, since we're facing the consequences of climate change on our civilization and they aren't good. They're only going to get worse, too. So who do we look to for models of how to change our food production?Anyway, the 2007 revision isn't different in any significant way to the 1997 version and you'll get a lot out of reading it.

For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation.

31,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"[Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions."

“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups?The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book.

33,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77981-mike-shapiro,4,"Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind. "

The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit."

This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid."

تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری (علمی، هنری، معماری، سیاسی، و غیره) در قاره اورآسیا رخ داده‌

زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ دایموند در این کتاب برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به

مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی آمریکا را ویران کردند؛ اوراسیا پس از آخرین عصر یخ شانس برخورداری از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی و زیست‌ محیطی را دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی اوراسیا را دلایل اصلی توسعه زودهنگام کشاورزی در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند بز، سگ یا بزرگتر) در طبیعت اوراسیا یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را اختیار مبتکران اروپایی و آسیایی کشاورزی و به خصوص اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً بین‌النهرین و ترکیه) گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی عامل پر اهمیتتربود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر اوراسیا در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردم اورآسیا به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط اوراسیا اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی آمریکا، و تا حدی آفریقا، به دلیل تنوع گسترده در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز آفریقا، یا آمریکا قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، سرخپوستان ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله بر خلاف غلات اوراسیا، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، مه کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است ذکر شود که پس از آنکه به عنوان مثال در تمدن می.سی.سی.پی در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد. چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در اورآسیا یافت می‌شده‌ است) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری همچون موز، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای آفریقا عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، اورآسیا بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد: اسب و شتر که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، بز و گوسفند برای پوست، پوشاک، و پنیر؛ گاو برای شیر و ورزا برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند خوک‌ها، و مرغ برای خوردن. آفریقایی‌ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با شیر، پلنگ و امثالهم طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تنها جانورانی مفید برای استفاده بشر در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق آسیا آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، و هنگام گسترش استرانیزی به گینه نو وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب دایموند اجمالاً به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب اروپا، و نه آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین) بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب آسیا، دایموند پاسخ پریسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب آسیا را بسیار خشک و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز اروپا، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق آسیا، دایموند حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با ثبات و جدا افتاده‌ ای شد، که هیچ فشار خارجی قابل توجهی، آن را تهدید نمی‌کرده‌ است؛ این امر باعث تمرکز بیش از حد تصمیم‌گیری شده، و نوعی خودکامگی بی‌رقابت را، ایجاد کرده‌ است، که خود پس از مدتی، منجر به ایستایی جامعه، و در مواردی (مانند اختراع اسلحه و کشتی‌های اقیانوس پیما) سرکوب تکنولوژی از سوی حاکمان شده‌ است؛ در اروپا وجود موانع طبیعی بسیار (مانند کوه‌های عظیم و خلیجها) منجر به ایجاد دول ملی محلی رقیب شد؛ این رقابت

40,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852363-joshua-parkinson,4,"In 1532, Francisco Pizarro and a band of 168 Spaniards punctured the heart of the Inca Empire and proceeded to capture its emperor, decimate its citizens, and plunder its gold. Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance."

Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."

There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic."

Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work."
46,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies. "

48,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to ""favor"" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. "
49,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,4,"Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended."
50,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113897-rhiannon,2,"I have this awesome picture in my head in which Jared Diamond did not write this book. He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome."
51,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read. "
52,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,1,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space."

In my opinion, this book has pristine description the 1966 revolution in Indonesia.2. This book has interesting theory of the losing of China vs. European since 15th century.3. I found the epilogue is reminding me some with Asimov’s psychohistory, with chapter title: “THE FUTURE OF HUMAN HISTORY AS A SCIENCE”.

54,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL: THE FATES OF HUMAN SOCIETIES BY JARED DIAMOND: This is one of those books that takes you a while to read -- it's pretty heavy non-fiction -- and yet at the end of it, you feel like Hippocrates, a Muslim scientist, or Leonardo Da Vinci must have felt at the realization of a great discovery. The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: ""Oh, that's how that happened,"" or ""that's why it's like that."" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way. And how is this simply explained? To use Jared Diamond's example:If you liked this review, and would like to read more, go to BookBanter."
55,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6852430-fourtriplezed,4,"In the end I have found this book a bit difficult to write about. It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose in the end this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suppose that each individual can make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually."

57,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5702158-daniel-bastian,5,"“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples’ environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.” What do Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Francisco Pizarro have in common? Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it’s no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to “an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable.” (p. 408).To Diamond’s great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).“Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia’s having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.” (p. 163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.“The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia’s Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world’s 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.” (p. 139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.The Invisible AllyFor all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of human history: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.Closing ThoughtsOne of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, GGS is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography.If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. GGS makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
58,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF EVERYbody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?...Diamond immediately takes great pains to shoot down any ideas of one race being more intelligent than another. Yes, some thought so, but they've been refuted for long enough that I thought he belabored the point. This section does introduce us to his method of argument which is to set up straw men & knock them down. I don't care for it much since the questions aren't always honest or complete.Eurasia is an iffy area for Diamond's purposes. It often includes northern Africa, but generally not eastern Asia or northern Europe. This makes sense in the context of the plant & animal species available to the humans of the time. Eurasia had the most species of both that could readily be domesticated. Of all the plants, only a few were readily domesticated. In Eurasia, the number made for a critical mass which led to earlier civilization. Giving up hunter-gatherer often isn't an advantage to individuals, but is to the tribes/clans as a whole. More food reserves, more specialization (leaders, soldiers, farmers), better able & pressure to compete & share discoveries.It's amazing how few plants & animals can be domesticated - only 14 large animals by his count. There isn't that much megafauna (animals generally averaging over 100 lbs) that early man didn't wipe out & most of those evolved with man. They survived because they learned early & well to fear & avoid or live with us. In almost every case where they didn't, such as in Australia & the Americas, they went extinct shortly after we showed up. Successful domestication is based on the Anna Karenina Syndrome, a name given due to the first line of the novel.Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.IOW, a happy family has many things right while it only takes one of any number of things to make an unhappy one. Plants & animals must have everything right to become domesticated, especially early on. Wheat needed very little modification & we domesticated it (or vice versa) very early while we still don't domesticate oaks because they take so long to mature, breeding characteristics*, & it's so hard to economically pick their acorns due to their size & competition with other animals.(* A complex of genes controls tannin production, so it's very difficult to breed a non-bitter acorn. If only 1 gene were in control, we might have domesticated them (pecans) even if it were a recessive one. Oaks just had too many things wrong.)The proximity to animals & each other also led to more disease. The originating groups of humans survived with immunity, but when they met another group without similar immunity, the new group was often wiped out. Obvious examples are the natives of the Americas & the spread by Europeans of small pox & other diseases.Eurasia also had the most contiguous land along generally the same latitude. This helped spread domesticated plants, animals, diseases, & ideas. North to south, like sub-Saharan Africa or Mexico to South America, is a problem since temperature, hours of daylight, & general climate varies too greatly for many plants & animals to survive a slow expansion across them. While humans could adapt to environments from desert to jungle, their plants, animals, inventions, & diseases often couldn't/didn't.Different environments also slowed humans so not only weren't inventions spread, but there wasn't the pressure to develop/adopt new methods or die. Sub-Saharan Africa is considered an entirely separate area, almost a continent of its own, from northern Africa in terms of evolution. Australia, New Zealand, & Tasmania were all distinct from the rest of the world & even each other.So, the answer to the central question is civilizations developed differently due to their environments:1) The number & variety of plants & animals that were available to domesticate.2) The ease of diffusion & migration within the continent & 3) between continents.4) Continental population size.He really should add a 5th - plain luck. As he points out, in the early 15th century, China was ready to explore the world, but political infighting in their unified government killed the exploration party almost a century before Columbus set out. While Columbus was originally turned down, he had multiple governments to try, one of which eventually opened the doors to expansion which led to many of them - all European - competing around the globe to grab the prizes.The audio edition of this book is abridged, although I hadn't realized that when I started listening & it sure seemed long enough. It wasn't until I got the ebook to see some of the maps & reread certain sections that I realized how much had been cut out.

His synopsis & maunderings in the beginning are interesting only from a historic point of view, although he seems to pretty much have the basics right, so it doesn't invalidate his later conclusions. It does stretch that section out a lot, though. It's cool to see how well a different science has nailed down so many questions & in such a short time.Overall, very good, but a bit dated & long. Grover Gardner did a great job reading this & I'd suggest the abridged version backed by a book since the maps help & reading more in some areas was good."

Well told tale. Persuasive, goodness knows. Maybe even partially correct, who knows, since we're facing the consequences of climate change on our civilization and they aren't good. They're only going to get worse, too. So who do we look to for models of how to change our food production?Anyway, the 2007 revision isn't different in any significant way to the 1997 version and you'll get a lot out of reading it.

For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation. As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure."
61,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"[Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions."

“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups?The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book. Here is a link to the first of its three episodes.Diamond's book Collapse, is also amazing."
63,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77981-mike-shapiro,4,"Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind. "
64,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"It took me a while to complete Diamond's book (and admittedly I also distracted myself with a few Roth novels in the meantime) because of the density of the text and the variety of ideas presented. The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit."
65,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,1,"Terrible. This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid."

The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals.

تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری (علمی، هنری، معماری، سیاسی، و غیره) در قاره اورآسیا رخ داده‌

زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ دایموند در این کتاب برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به

می‌آورد (فولاد)؛کتاب از عوامل جغرافیایی استفاده می‌کند تا نشان دهد که چگونه اروپایی‌ها چنین تکنولوژی برتر نظامی‌ای تولید کرده ‌اند و چرا بیماریهایی که اروپایی‌ها، و آسیایی‌ها، نسبت به آن‌ها از حدی مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی آمریکا را ویران کردند؛ اوراسیا پس از آخرین عصر یخ شانس برخورداری از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی و زیست‌ محیطی را دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی اوراسیا را دلایل اصلی توسعه زودهنگام کشاورزی در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند بز، سگ یا بزرگتر) در طبیعت اوراسیا یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را اختیار مبتکران اروپایی و آسیایی کشاورزی و به خصوص اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً بین‌النهرین و ترکیه) گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی عامل پر اهمیتتربود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر اوراسیا در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردم اورآسیا به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط اوراسیا اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی آمریکا، و تا حدی آفریقا، به دلیل تنوع گسترده در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز آفریقا، یا آمریکا قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، سرخپوستان ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله بر خلاف غلات اوراسیا، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، مه کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است ذکر شود که پس از آنکه به عنوان مثال در تمدن می.سی.سی.پی در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد. چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در اورآسیا یافت می‌شده‌ است) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری همچون موز، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای آفریقا عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، اورآسیا بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد: اسب و شتر که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، بز و گوسفند برای پوست، پوشاک، و پنیر؛ گاو برای شیر و ورزا برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند خوک‌ها، و مرغ برای خوردن. آفریقایی‌ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با شیر، پلنگ و امثالهم طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تنها جانورانی مفید برای استفاده بشر در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق آسیا آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، و هنگام گسترش استرانیزی به گینه نو وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب دایموند اجمالاً به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب اروپا، و نه آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین) بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب آسیا، دایموند پاسخ پریسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب آسیا را بسیار خشک و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز اروپا، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق آسیا، دایموند حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با ثبات و جدا افتاده‌ ای شد، که هیچ فشار خارجی قابل توجهی، آن را تهدید نمی‌کرده‌ است؛ این امر باعث تمرکز بیش از حد تصمیم‌گیری شده، و نوعی خودکامگی بی‌رقابت را، ایجاد کرده‌ است، که خود پس از مدتی، منجر به ایستایی جامعه، و در مواردی (مانند اختراع اسلحه و کشتی‌های اقیانوس پیما) سرکوب تکنولوژی از سوی حاکمان شده‌ است؛ در اروپا وجود موانع طبیعی بسیار (مانند کوه‌های عظیم و خلیجها) منجر به ایجاد دول ملی محلی رقیب شد؛ این رقابت کشورهای اروپایی را (با اینکه مانند چین توسط حاکمان خودکامه کنترل می‌شدند) تشویق به نوآوری کرد و از رکود فناوری جلوگیری شدا. شربیانی"

70,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852363-joshua-parkinson,4,"In 1532, Francisco Pizarro and a band of 168 Spaniards punctured the heart of the Inca Empire and proceeded to capture its emperor, decimate its citizens, and plunder its gold. Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance."

What makes the book particularly good is the intimate hands-on experience that Jared has on the wide variety of fields required to attempt a book like this. The last four or five chapters start to get very repetitive, but except for that Diamond has taken a stunningly large scale view of history that keeps you enthralled throughout the 13,000 years we cover in this book.

Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."
73,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"Diamond attempts to ""provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years,"" AND answer the question of why some cultures thrive while others perish or are conquered by others. There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic."

Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work."
76,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies. "

78,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to ""favor"" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. "
79,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,4,"Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended."

He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome."
81,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read. "
82,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,1,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space."

The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: ""Oh, that's how that happened,"" or ""that's why it's like that."" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way. And how is this simply explained? To use Jared Diamond's example:If you liked this review, and would like to read more, go to BookBanter."

It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose in the end this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suppose that each individual can make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually."

87,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5702158-daniel-bastian,5,"“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples’ environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.” What do Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Francisco Pizarro have in common? Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it’s no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to “an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable.” (p. 408).To Diamond’s great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).“Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia’s having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.” (p. 163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.“The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia’s Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world’s 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.” (p. 139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.The Invisible AllyFor all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of human history: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.Closing ThoughtsOne of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, GGS is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography.If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. GGS makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
88,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF EVERYbody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?...Diamond immediately takes great pains to shoot down any ideas of one race being more intelligent than another. Yes, some thought so, but they've been refuted for long enough that I thought he belabored the point. This section does introduce us to his method of argument which is to set up straw men & knock them down. I don't care for it much since the questions aren't always honest or complete.Eurasia is an iffy area for Diamond's purposes. It often includes northern Africa, but generally not eastern Asia or northern Europe. This makes sense in the context of the plant & animal species available to the humans of the time. Eurasia had the most species of both that could readily be domesticated. Of all the plants, only a few were readily domesticated. In Eurasia, the number made for a critical mass which led to earlier civilization. Giving up hunter-gatherer often isn't an advantage to individuals, but is to the tribes/clans as a whole. More food reserves, more specialization (leaders, soldiers, farmers), better able & pressure to compete & share discoveries.It's amazing how few plants & animals can be domesticated - only 14 large animals by his count. There isn't that much megafauna (animals generally averaging over 100 lbs) that early man didn't wipe out & most of those evolved with man. They survived because they learned early & well to fear & avoid or live with us. In almost every case where they didn't, such as in Australia & the Americas, they went extinct shortly after we showed up. Successful domestication is based on the Anna Karenina Syndrome, a name given due to the first line of the novel.Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.IOW, a happy family has many things right while it only takes one of any number of things to make an unhappy one. Plants & animals must have everything right to become domesticated, especially early on. Wheat needed very little modification & we domesticated it (or vice versa) very early while we still don't domesticate oaks because they take so long to mature, breeding characteristics*, & it's so hard to economically pick their acorns due to their size & competition with other animals.(* A complex of genes controls tannin production, so it's very difficult to breed a non-bitter acorn. If only 1 gene were in control, we might have domesticated them (pecans) even if it were a recessive one. Oaks just had too many things wrong.)The proximity to animals & each other also led to more disease. The originating groups of humans survived with immunity, but when they met another group without similar immunity, the new group was often wiped out. Obvious examples are the natives of the Americas & the spread by Europeans of small pox & other diseases.Eurasia also had the most contiguous land along generally the same latitude. This helped spread domesticated plants, animals, diseases, & ideas. North to south, like sub-Saharan Africa or Mexico to South America, is a problem since temperature, hours of daylight, & general climate varies too greatly for many plants & animals to survive a slow expansion across them. While humans could adapt to environments from desert to jungle, their plants, animals, inventions, & diseases often couldn't/didn't.Different environments also slowed humans so not only weren't inventions spread, but there wasn't the pressure to develop/adopt new methods or die. Sub-Saharan Africa is considered an entirely separate area, almost a continent of its own, from northern Africa in terms of evolution. Australia, New Zealand, & Tasmania were all distinct from the rest of the world & even each other.So, the answer to the central question is civilizations developed differently due to their environments:1) The number & variety of plants & animals that were available to domesticate.2) The ease of diffusion & migration within the continent & 3) between continents.4) Continental population size.He really should add a 5th - plain luck. As he points out, in the early 15th century, China was ready to explore the world, but political infighting in their unified government killed the exploration party almost a century before Columbus set out. While Columbus was originally turned down, he had multiple governments to try, one of which eventually opened the doors to expansion which led to many of them - all European - competing around the globe to grab the prizes.The audio edition of this book is abridged, although I hadn't realized that when I started listening & it sure seemed long enough.

His synopsis & maunderings in the beginning are interesting only from a historic point of view, although he seems to pretty much have the basics right, so it doesn't invalidate his later conclusions. It does stretch that section out a lot, though. It's cool to see how well a different science has nailed down so many questions & in such a short time.Overall, very good, but a bit dated & long. Grover Gardner did a great job reading this & I'd suggest the abridged version backed by a book since the maps help & reading more in some areas was good."

Well told tale. Persuasive, goodness knows. Maybe even partially correct, who knows, since we're facing the consequences of climate change on our civilization and they aren't good. They're only going to get worse, too. So who do we look to for models of how to change our food production?Anyway, the 2007 revision isn't different in any significant way to the 1997 version and you'll get a lot out of reading it.

For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation. As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure."
91,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"[Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions."

“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups?The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book.

93,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77981-mike-shapiro,4,"Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind. "
94,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"It took me a while to complete Diamond's book (and admittedly I also distracted myself with a few Roth novels in the meantime) because of the density of the text and the variety of ideas presented. The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit."
95,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,1,"Terrible. This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid."

The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals.

می‌آورد)؛ در مواردی که تفاوت‌های فرهنگی، یا ژنتیکی، به نفع اورآسیایی‌ها عمل کرده‌ است (به عنوان مثال دولت متمرکز در چین، یا مقاومت ژنتیکی در برابر بسیاری بیماری‌ها در میان اورآسیای‌ها)، این مزیت‌ها تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری (علمی، هنری، معماری، سیاسی، و غیره) در قاره اورآسیا رخ داده‌

زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ دایموند در این کتاب برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به راههایی که به وسیله آن‌ها، اروپایی‌ها علی‌رغم تعداد نفرات کمتر، ملتهای دیگر را مغلوب کرده) و سلطهٔ خود را حفظ کرده‌ اند، سلاح‌های برتر مستقیماً منجر به برتری نظامی می‌شوند (اسلحه)؛ بیماری‌های اروپایی

مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی آمریکا را ویران کردند؛ اوراسیا پس از آخرین عصر یخ شانس برخورداری از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی و زیست‌ محیطی را دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی اوراسیا را دلایل اصلی توسعه زودهنگام کشاورزی در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند بز، سگ یا بزرگتر) در طبیعت اوراسیا یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را اختیار مبتکران اروپایی و آسیایی کشاورزی و به خصوص اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً بین‌النهرین و ترکیه) گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی عامل پر اهمیتتربود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر اوراسیا در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردم اورآسیا به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط اوراسیا اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی آمریکا، و تا حدی آفریقا، به دلیل تنوع گسترده در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز آفریقا، یا آمریکا قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، سرخپوستان ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله بر خلاف غلات اوراسیا، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، مه کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است ذکر شود که پس از آنکه به عنوان مثال در تمدن می.سی.سی.پی در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد. چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در اورآسیا یافت می‌شده‌ است) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری همچون موز، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای آفریقا عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، اورآسیا بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد: اسب و شتر که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، بز و گوسفند برای پوست، پوشاک، و پنیر؛ گاو برای شیر و ورزا برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند خوک‌ها، و مرغ برای خوردن. آفریقایی‌ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با شیر، پلنگ و امثالهم طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تنها جانورانی مفید برای استفاده بشر در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق آسیا آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، و هنگام گسترش استرانیزی به گینه نو وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب دایموند اجمالاً به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب اروپا، و نه آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین) بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب آسیا، دایموند پاسخ پریسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب آسیا را بسیار خشک و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز اروپا، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق آسیا، دایموند حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با ثبات و جدا افتاده‌ ای شد، که هیچ فشار خارجی قابل توجهی، آن را تهدید نمی‌کرده‌ است؛ این امر باعث تمرکز بیش از حد تصمیم‌گیری شده، و نوعی خودکامگی بی‌رقابت را، ایجاد کرده‌ است، که خود پس از مدتی، منجر به ایستایی جامعه، و در مواردی (مانند اختراع اسلحه و کشتی‌های اقیانوس پیما) سرکوب تکنولوژی از سوی حاکمان شده‌ است؛ در اروپا وجود موانع طبیعی بسیار (مانند کوه‌های عظیم و خلیجها) منجر به ایجاد دول ملی محلی رقیب شد؛ این رقابت

Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance."

What makes the book particularly good is the intimate hands-on experience that Jared has on the wide variety of fields required to attempt a book like this. The last four or five chapters start to get very repetitive, but except for that Diamond has taken a stunningly large scale view of history that keeps you enthralled throughout the 13,000 years we cover in this book. "
102,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198340-jim,5,"The PuristI give you now Professor Twist,A conscientious scientist,Trustees exclaimed, ""He never bungles!""And sent him off to distant jungles.Camped on a tropic riverside,One day he missed his loving bride.She had, the guide informed him later,Been eaten by an alligator.Professor Twist could not but smile.""You mean,"" he said, ""a crocodile.""That bit of Ogden Nash whimsy came into my head as I thought about Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, a reflection on human history through the lens of evolutionary biology. Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."
103,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"Diamond attempts to ""provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years,"" AND answer the question of why some cultures thrive while others perish or are conquered by others. There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic."

105,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“In short, Europe’s colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume. Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work."
106,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies. "
107,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,5,What a terrific book. 😍One sentence review: Human history is a function of geography. Detailed review to follow!
108,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to ""favor"" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. "
109,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,4,"Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended."
110,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113897-rhiannon,2,"I have this awesome picture in my head in which Jared Diamond did not write this book. He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome."
111,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read. "
112,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,1,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space."

114,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL: THE FATES OF HUMAN SOCIETIES BY JARED DIAMOND: This is one of those books that takes you a while to read -- it's pretty heavy non-fiction -- and yet at the end of it, you feel like Hippocrates, a Muslim scientist, or Leonardo Da Vinci must have felt at the realization of a great discovery. The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: ""Oh, that's how that happened,"" or ""that's why it's like that."" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way. And how is this simply explained? To use Jared Diamond's example:If you liked this review, and would like to read more, go to BookBanter."

It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose in the end this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suppose that each individual can make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually."

Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it’s no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to “an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable.” (p. 408).To Diamond’s great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).“Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia’s having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.” (p. 163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.“The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia’s Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world’s 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.” (p. 139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.The Invisible AllyFor all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of human history: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.Closing ThoughtsOne of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, GGS is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography.If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. GGS makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
118,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF EVERYbody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?...Diamond immediately takes great pains to shoot down any ideas of one race being more intelligent than another. Yes, some thought so, but they've been refuted for long enough that I thought he belabored the point. This section does introduce us to his method of argument which is to set up straw men & knock them down. I don't care for it much since the questions aren't always honest or complete.Eurasia is an iffy area for Diamond's purposes. It often includes northern Africa, but generally not eastern Asia or northern Europe. This makes sense in the context of the plant & animal species available to the humans of the time. Eurasia had the most species of both that could readily be domesticated. Of all the plants, only a few were readily domesticated. In Eurasia, the number made for a critical mass which led to earlier civilization. Giving up hunter-gatherer often isn't an advantage to individuals, but is to the tribes/clans as a whole. More food reserves, more specialization (leaders, soldiers, farmers), better able & pressure to compete & share discoveries.It's amazing how few plants & animals can be domesticated - only 14 large animals by his count. There isn't that much megafauna (animals generally averaging over 100 lbs) that early man didn't wipe out & most of those evolved with man. They survived because they learned early & well to fear & avoid or live with us. In almost every case where they didn't, such as in Australia & the Americas, they went extinct shortly after we showed up. Successful domestication is based on the Anna Karenina Syndrome, a name given due to the first line of the novel.Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.IOW, a happy family has many things right while it only takes one of any number of things to make an unhappy one. Plants & animals must have everything right to become domesticated, especially early on. Wheat needed very little modification & we domesticated it (or vice versa) very early while we still don't domesticate oaks because they take so long to mature, breeding characteristics*, & it's so hard to economically pick their acorns due to their size & competition with other animals.(* A complex of genes controls tannin production, so it's very difficult to breed a non-bitter acorn. If only 1 gene were in control, we might have domesticated them (pecans) even if it were a recessive one. Oaks just had too many things wrong.)The proximity to animals & each other also led to more disease. The originating groups of humans survived with immunity, but when they met another group without similar immunity, the new group was often wiped out. Obvious examples are the natives of the Americas & the spread by Europeans of small pox & other diseases.Eurasia also had the most contiguous land along generally the same latitude. This helped spread domesticated plants, animals, diseases, & ideas. North to south, like sub-Saharan Africa or Mexico to South America, is a problem since temperature, hours of daylight, & general climate varies too greatly for many plants & animals to survive a slow expansion across them. While humans could adapt to environments from desert to jungle, their plants, animals, inventions, & diseases often couldn't/didn't.Different environments also slowed humans so not only weren't inventions spread, but there wasn't the pressure to develop/adopt new methods or die. Sub-Saharan Africa is considered an entirely separate area, almost a continent of its own, from northern Africa in terms of evolution. Australia, New Zealand, & Tasmania were all distinct from the rest of the world & even each other.So, the answer to the central question is civilizations developed differently due to their environments:1) The number & variety of plants & animals that were available to domesticate.2) The ease of diffusion & migration within the continent & 3) between continents.4) Continental population size.He really should add a 5th - plain luck. As he points out, in the early 15th century, China was ready to explore the world, but political infighting in their unified government killed the exploration party almost a century before Columbus set out. While Columbus was originally turned down, he had multiple governments to try, one of which eventually opened the doors to expansion which led to many of them - all European - competing around the globe to grab the prizes.The audio edition of this book is abridged, although I hadn't realized that when I started listening & it sure seemed long enough.

His synopsis & maunderings in the beginning are interesting only from a historic point of view, although he seems to pretty much have the basics right, so it doesn't invalidate his later conclusions. It does stretch that section out a lot, though. It's cool to see how well a different science has nailed down so many questions & in such a short time.Overall, very good, but a bit dated & long. Grover Gardner did a great job reading this & I'd suggest the abridged version backed by a book since the maps help & reading more in some areas was good."

Well told tale. Persuasive, goodness knows. Maybe even partially correct, who knows, since we're facing the consequences of climate change on our civilization and they aren't good. They're only going to get worse, too. So who do we look to for models of how to change our food production?Anyway, the 2007 revision isn't different in any significant way to the 1997 version and you'll get a lot out of reading it.

For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation.

121,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"[Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions."

“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups?The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book. Here is a link to the first of its three episodes.Diamond's book Collapse, is also amazing."
123,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77981-mike-shapiro,4,"Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind. "
124,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"It took me a while to complete Diamond's book (and admittedly I also distracted myself with a few Roth novels in the meantime) because of the density of the text and the variety of ideas presented. The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit."

This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid."

تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری (علمی، هنری، معماری، سیاسی، و غیره) در قاره اورآسیا رخ داده‌

زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ دایموند در این کتاب برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به

مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی آمریکا را ویران کردند؛ اوراسیا پس از آخرین عصر یخ شانس برخورداری از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی و زیست‌ محیطی را دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی اوراسیا را دلایل اصلی توسعه زودهنگام کشاورزی در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند بز، سگ یا بزرگتر) در طبیعت اوراسیا یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را اختیار مبتکران اروپایی و آسیایی کشاورزی و به خصوص اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً بین‌النهرین و ترکیه) گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی عامل پر اهمیتتربود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر اوراسیا در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردم اورآسیا به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط اوراسیا اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی آمریکا، و تا حدی آفریقا، به دلیل تنوع گسترده در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز آفریقا، یا آمریکا قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، سرخپوستان ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله بر خلاف غلات اوراسیا، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، مه کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است ذکر شود که پس از آنکه به عنوان مثال در تمدن می.سی.سی.پی در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد. چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در اورآسیا یافت می‌شده‌ است) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری همچون موز، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای آفریقا عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، اورآسیا بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد: اسب و شتر که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، بز و گوسفند برای پوست، پوشاک، و پنیر؛ گاو برای شیر و ورزا برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند خوک‌ها، و مرغ برای خوردن. آفریقایی‌ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با شیر، پلنگ و امثالهم طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تنها جانورانی مفید برای استفاده بشر در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق آسیا آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، و هنگام گسترش استرانیزی به گینه نو وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب دایموند اجمالاً به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب اروپا، و نه آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین) بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب آسیا، دایموند پاسخ پریسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب آسیا را بسیار خشک و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز اروپا، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق آسیا، دایموند حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با ثبات و جدا افتاده‌ ای شد، که هیچ فشار خارجی قابل توجهی، آن را تهدید نمی‌کرده‌ است؛ این امر باعث تمرکز بیش از حد تصمیم‌گیری شده، و نوعی خودکامگی بی‌رقابت را، ایجاد کرده‌ است، که خود پس از مدتی، منجر به ایستایی جامعه، و در مواردی (مانند اختراع اسلحه و کشتی‌های اقیانوس پیما) سرکوب تکنولوژی از سوی حاکمان شده‌ است؛ در اروپا وجود موانع طبیعی بسیار (مانند کوه‌های عظیم و خلیجها) منجر به ایجاد دول ملی محلی رقیب شد؛ این رقابت

130,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852363-joshua-parkinson,4,"In 1532, Francisco Pizarro and a band of 168 Spaniards punctured the heart of the Inca Empire and proceeded to capture its emperor, decimate its citizens, and plunder its gold. Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance."

Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."
133,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"Diamond attempts to ""provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years,"" AND answer the question of why some cultures thrive while others perish or are conquered by others. There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic."

Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work."
136,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies. "

138,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to ""favor"" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. "
139,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,4,"Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended."
140,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113897-rhiannon,2,"I have this awesome picture in my head in which Jared Diamond did not write this book. He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome."
141,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read. "
142,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,1,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space."

144,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL: THE FATES OF HUMAN SOCIETIES BY JARED DIAMOND: This is one of those books that takes you a while to read -- it's pretty heavy non-fiction -- and yet at the end of it, you feel like Hippocrates, a Muslim scientist, or Leonardo Da Vinci must have felt at the realization of a great discovery. The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: ""Oh, that's how that happened,"" or ""that's why it's like that."" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way. And how is this simply explained? To use Jared Diamond's example:If you liked this review, and would like to read more, go to BookBanter."
145,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6852430-fourtriplezed,4,"In the end I have found this book a bit difficult to write about. It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose in the end this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suppose that each individual can make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually."

147,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5702158-daniel-bastian,5,"“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples’ environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.” What do Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Francisco Pizarro have in common? Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it’s no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to “an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable.” (p. 408).To Diamond’s great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).“Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia’s having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.” (p. 163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.“The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia’s Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world’s 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.” (p. 139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.The Invisible AllyFor all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of human history: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.Closing ThoughtsOne of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, GGS is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography.If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. GGS makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
148,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF EVERYbody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?...Diamond immediately takes great pains to shoot down any ideas of one race being more intelligent than another. Yes, some thought so, but they've been refuted for long enough that I thought he belabored the point. This section does introduce us to his method of argument which is to set up straw men & knock them down. I don't care for it much since the questions aren't always honest or complete.Eurasia is an iffy area for Diamond's purposes. It often includes northern Africa, but generally not eastern Asia or northern Europe. This makes sense in the context of the plant & animal species available to the humans of the time. Eurasia had the most species of both that could readily be domesticated. Of all the plants, only a few were readily domesticated. In Eurasia, the number made for a critical mass which led to earlier civilization. Giving up hunter-gatherer often isn't an advantage to individuals, but is to the tribes/clans as a whole. More food reserves, more specialization (leaders, soldiers, farmers), better able & pressure to compete & share discoveries.It's amazing how few plants & animals can be domesticated - only 14 large animals by his count. There isn't that much megafauna (animals generally averaging over 100 lbs) that early man didn't wipe out & most of those evolved with man. They survived because they learned early & well to fear & avoid or live with us. In almost every case where they didn't, such as in Australia & the Americas, they went extinct shortly after we showed up. Successful domestication is based on the Anna Karenina Syndrome, a name given due to the first line of the novel.Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.IOW, a happy family has many things right while it only takes one of any number of things to make an unhappy one. Plants & animals must have everything right to become domesticated, especially early on. Wheat needed very little modification & we domesticated it (or vice versa) very early while we still don't domesticate oaks because they take so long to mature, breeding characteristics*, & it's so hard to economically pick their acorns due to their size & competition with other animals.(* A complex of genes controls tannin production, so it's very difficult to breed a non-bitter acorn. If only 1 gene were in control, we might have domesticated them (pecans) even if it were a recessive one. Oaks just had too many things wrong.)The proximity to animals & each other also led to more disease. The originating groups of humans survived with immunity, but when they met another group without similar immunity, the new group was often wiped out. Obvious examples are the natives of the Americas & the spread by Europeans of small pox & other diseases.Eurasia also had the most contiguous land along generally the same latitude. This helped spread domesticated plants, animals, diseases, & ideas. North to south, like sub-Saharan Africa or Mexico to South America, is a problem since temperature, hours of daylight, & general climate varies too greatly for many plants & animals to survive a slow expansion across them. While humans could adapt to environments from desert to jungle, their plants, animals, inventions, & diseases often couldn't/didn't.Different environments also slowed humans so not only weren't inventions spread, but there wasn't the pressure to develop/adopt new methods or die. Sub-Saharan Africa is considered an entirely separate area, almost a continent of its own, from northern Africa in terms of evolution. Australia, New Zealand, & Tasmania were all distinct from the rest of the world & even each other.So, the answer to the central question is civilizations developed differently due to their environments:1) The number & variety of plants & animals that were available to domesticate.2) The ease of diffusion & migration within the continent & 3) between continents.4) Continental population size.He really should add a 5th - plain luck. As he points out, in the early 15th century, China was ready to explore the world, but political infighting in their unified government killed the exploration party almost a century before Columbus set out. While Columbus was originally turned down, he had multiple governments to try, one of which eventually opened the doors to expansion which led to many of them - all European - competing around the globe to grab the prizes.The audio edition of this book is abridged, although I hadn't realized that when I started listening & it sure seemed long enough. It wasn't until I got the ebook to see some of the maps & reread certain sections that I realized how much had been cut out.

His synopsis & maunderings in the beginning are interesting only from a historic point of view, although he seems to pretty much have the basics right, so it doesn't invalidate his later conclusions. It does stretch that section out a lot, though. It's cool to see how well a different science has nailed down so many questions & in such a short time.Overall, very good, but a bit dated & long. Grover Gardner did a great job reading this & I'd suggest the abridged version backed by a book since the maps help & reading more in some areas was good."

Well told tale. Persuasive, goodness knows. Maybe even partially correct, who knows, since we're facing the consequences of climate change on our civilization and they aren't good. They're only going to get worse, too. So who do we look to for models of how to change our food production?Anyway, the 2007 revision isn't different in any significant way to the 1997 version and you'll get a lot out of reading it.

For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation. As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure."
151,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"[Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions."

“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups?The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book. Here is a link to the first of its three episodes.Diamond's book Collapse, is also amazing."
153,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77981-mike-shapiro,4,"Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind. "
154,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"It took me a while to complete Diamond's book (and admittedly I also distracted myself with a few Roth novels in the meantime) because of the density of the text and the variety of ideas presented. The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit."
155,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,1,"Terrible. This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid."

The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals.

حلقه ی بازخورد مثبت آن‌ها را، تقویت می‌کند (به این معنا که برتری محیطی، باعث پیشرفت تکنولوژی می‌شود، و برتری تکنولوژی، باعث پیشرفت‌های بیشتری می‌شوند، که در جای خود پیشرفت بیشتری نیز به دنبال می‌آورد)؛ در مواردی که تفاوت‌های فرهنگی، یا ژنتیکی، به نفع اورآسیایی‌ها عمل کرده‌ است (به عنوان مثال دولت متمرکز در چین، یا مقاومت ژنتیکی در برابر بسیاری بیماری‌ها در میان اورآسیای‌ها)، این مزیت‌ها تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری (علمی، هنری، معماری، سیاسی، و غیره) در قاره اورآسیا رخ داده‌ است؛ مردمان قاره‌ های دیگر (جنوب صحرای آفریقا، بومیان آمریکا، بومیان استرالیا و گینه نو، و ساکنین اصلی مناطق گرمسیری آسیای جنوب شرقی)، به‌ طور گسترده‌ ای مغلوب، و جا به‌ جا شده‌ اند، و در برخی موارد فوق‌العاده (اشاره به بومیان آمریکا، بومیان استرالیا و بومیان خوآسان جنوب آفریقا) عمدتاً از بین رفته‌ اندبرهان نخست این سلطه ی اوراسیائی‌ها، برتری‌های نظامی و سیاسی آن‌ها بوده، که خود ناشی از پیدایش زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ دایموند در این کتاب برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به راههایی که به وسیله آن‌ها، اروپایی‌ها علی‌رغم تعداد نفرات کمتر، ملتهای دیگر را مغلوب کرده) و سلطهٔ خود را حفظ کرده‌ اند، سلاح‌های برتر مستقیماً منجر به برتری نظامی می‌شوند (اسلحه)؛ بیماری‌های اروپایی و آسیایی جمعیت‌های بومی را تضعیف کرده، و کاهش داده، باعث می‌شوند اِعمال کنترل بر آن‌ها راحت‌تر شود (میکروب)، و دولت متمرکز ناسیونالیسم را ترویج داده، و بستری برای سازمان‌های قدرتمند نظامی به وجود می‌آورد (فولاد)؛کتاب از عوامل جغرافیایی استفاده می‌کند تا نشان دهد که چگونه اروپایی‌ها چنین تکنولوژی برتر نظامی‌ای تولید کرده ‌اند و چرا بیماریهایی که اروپایی‌ها، و آسیایی‌ها، نسبت به آن‌ها از حدی مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی آمریکا را ویران کردند؛ اوراسیا پس از آخرین عصر یخ شانس برخورداری از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی و زیست‌ محیطی را دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی اوراسیا را دلایل اصلی توسعه زودهنگام کشاورزی در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند بز، سگ یا بزرگتر) در طبیعت اوراسیا یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را اختیار مبتکران اروپایی و آسیایی کشاورزی و به خصوص اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً بین‌النهرین و ترکیه) گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی عامل پر اهمیتتربود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر اوراسیا در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردم اورآسیا به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط اوراسیا اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی آمریکا، و تا حدی آفریقا، به دلیل تنوع گسترده در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز آفریقا، یا آمریکا قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، سرخپوستان ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله بر خلاف غلات اوراسیا، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، مه کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است ذکر شود که پس از آنکه به عنوان مثال در تمدن می.سی.سی.پی در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد. چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در اورآسیا یافت می‌شده‌ است) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری همچون موز، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای آفریقا عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، اورآسیا بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد: اسب و شتر که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، بز و گوسفند برای پوست، پوشاک، و پنیر؛ گاو برای شیر و ورزا برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند خوک‌ها، و مرغ برای خوردن. آفریقایی‌ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با شیر، پلنگ و امثالهم طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تنها جانورانی مفید برای استفاده بشر در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق آسیا آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، و هنگام گسترش استرانیزی به گینه نو وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب دایموند اجمالاً به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب اروپا، و نه آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین) بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب آسیا، دایموند پاسخ پریسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب آسیا را بسیار خشک و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز اروپا، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق آسیا، دایموند حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با ثبات و جدا افتاده‌ ای شد، که هیچ فشار خارجی قابل توجهی، آن را تهدید نمی‌کرده‌ است؛ این امر باعث تمرکز بیش از حد تصمیم‌گیری شده، و نوعی خودکامگی بی‌رقابت را، ایجاد کرده‌ است، که خود پس از مدتی، منجر به ایستایی جامعه، و در مواردی (مانند اختراع اسلحه و کشتی‌های اقیانوس پیما) سرکوب تکنولوژی از سوی حاکمان شده‌ است؛ در اروپا وجود موانع طبیعی بسیار (مانند کوه‌های عظیم و خلیجها) منجر به ایجاد دول ملی محلی رقیب شد؛ این رقابت کشورهای اروپایی را (با اینکه مانند چین توسط حاکمان خودکامه کنترل می‌شدند) تشویق به نوآوری کرد و از رکود فناوری جلوگیری شدا. شربیانی"

160,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852363-joshua-parkinson,4,"In 1532, Francisco Pizarro and a band of 168 Spaniards punctured the heart of the Inca Empire and proceeded to capture its emperor, decimate its citizens, and plunder its gold. Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance."

What makes the book particularly good is the intimate hands-on experience that Jared has on the wide variety of fields required to attempt a book like this. The last four or five chapters start to get very repetitive, but except for that Diamond has taken a stunningly large scale view of history that keeps you enthralled throughout the 13,000 years we cover in this book.

Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."
163,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"Diamond attempts to ""provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years,"" AND answer the question of why some cultures thrive while others perish or are conquered by others. There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic."

Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work."
166,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies. "

168,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to ""favor"" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. "
169,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,4,"Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended."

He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome."
171,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read. "
172,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,1,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space."

But this book gave me so much more than that, it gave me answers or some revelations about some of my personal thinking all these years.I cannot comment much about the contents, there are a lot of reviews that describe the contents well.Some interesting points on this book for me:1. In my opinion, this book has pristine description the 1966 revolution in Indonesia.2. This book has interesting theory of the losing of China vs. European since 15th century.3. I found the epilogue is reminding me some with Asimov’s psychohistory, with chapter title: “THE FUTURE OF HUMAN HISTORY AS A SCIENCE”. For people who had read Foundation, please try the epilogue of this book.There is at least one hint about a leading civilization destroying its own environment… but it is another story.

The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: ""Oh, that's how that happened,"" or ""that's why it's like that."" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way. And how is this simply explained? To use Jared Diamond's example:If you liked this review, and would like to read more, go to BookBanter."
175,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6852430-fourtriplezed,4,"In the end I have found this book a bit difficult to write about. It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose in the end this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suppose that each individual can make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually."

177,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5702158-daniel-bastian,5,"“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples’ environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.” What do Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Francisco Pizarro have in common? Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it’s no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to “an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable.” (p. 408).To Diamond’s great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).“Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia’s having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.” (p. 163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.“The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia’s Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world’s 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.” (p. 139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.The Invisible AllyFor all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of human history: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.Closing ThoughtsOne of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, GGS is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography.If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. GGS makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
178,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF EVERYbody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?...Diamond immediately takes great pains to shoot down any ideas of one race being more intelligent than another. Yes, some thought so, but they've been refuted for long enough that I thought he belabored the point. This section does introduce us to his method of argument which is to set up straw men & knock them down. I don't care for it much since the questions aren't always honest or complete.Eurasia is an iffy area for Diamond's purposes. It often includes northern Africa, but generally not eastern Asia or northern Europe. This makes sense in the context of the plant & animal species available to the humans of the time. Eurasia had the most species of both that could readily be domesticated. Of all the plants, only a few were readily domesticated. In Eurasia, the number made for a critical mass which led to earlier civilization. Giving up hunter-gatherer often isn't an advantage to individuals, but is to the tribes/clans as a whole. More food reserves, more specialization (leaders, soldiers, farmers), better able & pressure to compete & share discoveries.It's amazing how few plants & animals can be domesticated - only 14 large animals by his count. There isn't that much megafauna (animals generally averaging over 100 lbs) that early man didn't wipe out & most of those evolved with man. They survived because they learned early & well to fear & avoid or live with us. In almost every case where they didn't, such as in Australia & the Americas, they went extinct shortly after we showed up. Successful domestication is based on the Anna Karenina Syndrome, a name given due to the first line of the novel.Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.IOW, a happy family has many things right while it only takes one of any number of things to make an unhappy one. Plants & animals must have everything right to become domesticated, especially early on. Wheat needed very little modification & we domesticated it (or vice versa) very early while we still don't domesticate oaks because they take so long to mature, breeding characteristics*, & it's so hard to economically pick their acorns due to their size & competition with other animals.(* A complex of genes controls tannin production, so it's very difficult to breed a non-bitter acorn. If only 1 gene were in control, we might have domesticated them (pecans) even if it were a recessive one. Oaks just had too many things wrong.)The proximity to animals & each other also led to more disease. The originating groups of humans survived with immunity, but when they met another group without similar immunity, the new group was often wiped out. Obvious examples are the natives of the Americas & the spread by Europeans of small pox & other diseases.Eurasia also had the most contiguous land along generally the same latitude. This helped spread domesticated plants, animals, diseases, & ideas. North to south, like sub-Saharan Africa or Mexico to South America, is a problem since temperature, hours of daylight, & general climate varies too greatly for many plants & animals to survive a slow expansion across them. While humans could adapt to environments from desert to jungle, their plants, animals, inventions, & diseases often couldn't/didn't.Different environments also slowed humans so not only weren't inventions spread, but there wasn't the pressure to develop/adopt new methods or die. Sub-Saharan Africa is considered an entirely separate area, almost a continent of its own, from northern Africa in terms of evolution. Australia, New Zealand, & Tasmania were all distinct from the rest of the world & even each other.So, the answer to the central question is civilizations developed differently due to their environments:1) The number & variety of plants & animals that were available to domesticate.2) The ease of diffusion & migration within the continent & 3) between continents.4) Continental population size.He really should add a 5th - plain luck. As he points out, in the early 15th century, China was ready to explore the world, but political infighting in their unified government killed the exploration party almost a century before Columbus set out. While Columbus was originally turned down, he had multiple governments to try, one of which eventually opened the doors to expansion which led to many of them - all European - competing around the globe to grab the prizes.The audio edition of this book is abridged, although I hadn't realized that when I started listening & it sure seemed long enough.

His synopsis & maunderings in the beginning are interesting only from a historic point of view, although he seems to pretty much have the basics right, so it doesn't invalidate his later conclusions. It does stretch that section out a lot, though. It's cool to see how well a different science has nailed down so many questions & in such a short time.Overall, very good, but a bit dated & long. Grover Gardner did a great job reading this & I'd suggest the abridged version backed by a book since the maps help & reading more in some areas was good."

Well told tale. Persuasive, goodness knows. Maybe even partially correct, who knows, since we're facing the consequences of climate change on our civilization and they aren't good. They're only going to get worse, too. So who do we look to for models of how to change our food production?Anyway, the 2007 revision isn't different in any significant way to the 1997 version and you'll get a lot out of reading it. I still think the 2005 PBS version is the easiest to absorb because there are no awful dreary tables and the pretty pictures are pretty.

For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation. As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure."
181,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"[Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions."

“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups?The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book. Here is a link to the first of its three episodes.Diamond's book Collapse, is also amazing."
183,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77981-mike-shapiro,4,"Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind. "
184,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"It took me a while to complete Diamond's book (and admittedly I also distracted myself with a few Roth novels in the meantime) because of the density of the text and the variety of ideas presented. The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit."
185,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,1,"Terrible. This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid."

The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals. Of course he is mostly right, but why in the 21st century is this considered such a novel idea, and why does he have to be so BORING about it? Don't believe the hype."

حلقه ی بازخورد مثبت آن‌ها را، تقویت می‌کند (به این معنا که برتری محیطی، باعث پیشرفت تکنولوژی می‌شود، و برتری تکنولوژی، باعث پیشرفت‌های بیشتری می‌شوند، که در جای خود پیشرفت بیشتری نیز به دنبال می‌آورد)؛ در مواردی که تفاوت‌های فرهنگی، یا ژنتیکی، به نفع اورآسیایی‌ها عمل کرده‌ است (به عنوان مثال دولت متمرکز در چین، یا مقاومت ژنتیکی در برابر بسیاری بیماری‌ها در میان اورآسیای‌ها)، این مزیت‌ها تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری (علمی، هنری، معماری، سیاسی، و غیره) در قاره اورآسیا رخ داده‌ است؛ مردمان قاره‌ های دیگر (جنوب صحرای آفریقا، بومیان آمریکا، بومیان استرالیا و گینه نو، و ساکنین اصلی مناطق گرمسیری آسیای جنوب شرقی)، به‌ طور گسترده‌ ای مغلوب، و جا به‌ جا شده‌ اند، و در برخی موارد فوق‌العاده (اشاره به بومیان آمریکا، بومیان استرالیا و بومیان خوآسان جنوب آفریقا) عمدتاً از بین رفته‌ اندبرهان نخست این سلطه ی اوراسیائی‌ها، برتری‌های نظامی و سیاسی آن‌ها بوده، که خود ناشی از پیدایش زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ دایموند در این کتاب برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به راههایی که به وسیله آن‌ها، اروپایی‌ها علی‌رغم تعداد نفرات کمتر، ملتهای دیگر را مغلوب کرده) و سلطهٔ خود را حفظ کرده‌ اند، سلاح‌های برتر مستقیماً منجر به برتری نظامی می‌شوند (اسلحه)؛ بیماری‌های اروپایی و آسیایی جمعیت‌های بومی را تضعیف کرده، و کاهش داده، باعث می‌شوند اِعمال کنترل بر آن‌ها راحت‌تر شود (میکروب)، و دولت متمرکز ناسیونالیسم را ترویج داده، و بستری برای سازمان‌های قدرتمند نظامی به وجود می‌آورد (فولاد)؛کتاب از عوامل جغرافیایی استفاده می‌کند تا نشان دهد که چگونه اروپایی‌ها چنین تکنولوژی برتر نظامی‌ای تولید کرده ‌اند و چرا بیماریهایی که اروپایی‌ها، و آسیایی‌ها، نسبت به آن‌ها از حدی مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی آمریکا را ویران کردند؛ اوراسیا پس از آخرین عصر یخ شانس برخورداری از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی و زیست‌ محیطی را دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی اوراسیا را دلایل اصلی توسعه زودهنگام کشاورزی در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند بز، سگ یا بزرگتر) در طبیعت اوراسیا یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را اختیار مبتکران اروپایی و آسیایی کشاورزی و به خصوص اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً بین‌النهرین و ترکیه) گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی عامل پر اهمیتتربود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر اوراسیا در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردم اورآسیا به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط اوراسیا اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی آمریکا، و تا حدی آفریقا، به دلیل تنوع گسترده در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز آفریقا، یا آمریکا قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، سرخپوستان ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله بر خلاف غلات اوراسیا، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، مه کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است ذکر شود که پس از آنکه به عنوان مثال در تمدن می.سی.سی.پی در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد. چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در اورآسیا یافت می‌شده‌ است) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری همچون موز، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای آفریقا عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، اورآسیا بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد: اسب و شتر که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، بز و گوسفند برای پوست، پوشاک، و پنیر؛ گاو برای شیر و ورزا برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند خوک‌ها، و مرغ برای خوردن. آفریقایی‌ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با شیر، پلنگ و امثالهم طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تنها جانورانی مفید برای استفاده بشر در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق آسیا آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، و هنگام گسترش استرانیزی به گینه نو وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب دایموند اجمالاً به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب اروپا، و نه آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین) بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب آسیا، دایموند پاسخ پریسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب آسیا را بسیار خشک و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز اروپا، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق آسیا، دایموند حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با ثبات و جدا افتاده‌ ای شد، که هیچ فشار خارجی قابل توجهی، آن را تهدید نمی‌کرده‌ است؛ این امر باعث تمرکز بیش از حد تصمیم‌گیری شده، و نوعی خودکامگی بی‌رقابت را، ایجاد کرده‌ است، که خود پس از مدتی، منجر به ایستایی جامعه، و در

190,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852363-joshua-parkinson,4,"In 1532, Francisco Pizarro and a band of 168 Spaniards punctured the heart of the Inca Empire and proceeded to capture its emperor, decimate its citizens, and plunder its gold. Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance."
191,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Jared sticks to the basic premise and plugs every hole in his argument so well to construct a magnificent explanation of the evolution of societies. What makes the book particularly good is the intimate hands-on experience that Jared has on the wide variety of fields required to attempt a book like this. The last four or five chapters start to get very repetitive, but except for that Diamond has taken a stunningly large scale view of history that keeps you enthralled throughout the 13,000 years we cover in this book. "

Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."
193,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"Diamond attempts to ""provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years,"" AND answer the question of why some cultures thrive while others perish or are conquered by others. There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic."

Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work."
196,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies. "

198,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to ""favor"" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. "
199,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,4,"Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended."
200,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113897-rhiannon,2,"I have this awesome picture in my head in which Jared Diamond did not write this book. He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome."
201,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read. "
202,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,1,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space."

But this book gave me so much more than that, it gave me answers or some revelations about some of my personal thinking all these years.I cannot comment much about the contents, there are a lot of reviews that describe the contents well.Some interesting points on this book for me:1. In my opinion, this book has pristine description the 1966 revolution in Indonesia.2. This book has interesting theory of the losing of China vs. European since 15th century.3. I found the epilogue is reminding me some with Asimov’s psychohistory, with chapter title: “THE FUTURE OF HUMAN HISTORY AS A SCIENCE”. For people who had read Foundation, please try the epilogue of this book.There is at least one hint about a leading civilization destroying its own environment… but it is another story. Mr. Diamond described this idea on his next book, Collapse."

The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: ""Oh, that's how that happened,"" or ""that's why it's like that."" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding. Another concept that I was very happy to be made so clear is the explanation of why whites conquered most of the world was not because they were a superior race in any way. And how is this simply explained? To use Jared Diamond's example:If you liked this review, and would like to read more, go to BookBanter."

It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose in the end this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suppose that each individual can make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually."

207,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5702158-daniel-bastian,5,"“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples’ environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.” What do Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Francisco Pizarro have in common? Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it’s no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to “an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable.” (p. 408).To Diamond’s great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).“Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia’s having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.” (p. 163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.“The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia’s Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world’s 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.” (p. 139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.The Invisible AllyFor all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of human history: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.Closing ThoughtsOne of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, GGS is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography.If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. GGS makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
208,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF EVERYbody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?...Diamond immediately takes great pains to shoot down any ideas of one race being more intelligent than another. Yes, some thought so, but they've been refuted for long enough that I thought he belabored the point. This section does introduce us to his method of argument which is to set up straw men & knock them down. I don't care for it much since the questions aren't always honest or complete.Eurasia is an iffy area for Diamond's purposes. It often includes northern Africa, but generally not eastern Asia or northern Europe. This makes sense in the context of the plant & animal species available to the humans of the time. Eurasia had the most species of both that could readily be domesticated. Of all the plants, only a few were readily domesticated. In Eurasia, the number made for a critical mass which led to earlier civilization. Giving up hunter-gatherer often isn't an advantage to individuals, but is to the tribes/clans as a whole. More food reserves, more specialization (leaders, soldiers, farmers), better able & pressure to compete & share discoveries.It's amazing how few plants & animals can be domesticated - only 14 large animals by his count. There isn't that much megafauna (animals generally averaging over 100 lbs) that early man didn't wipe out & most of those evolved with man. They survived because they learned early & well to fear & avoid or live with us. In almost every case where they didn't, such as in Australia & the Americas, they went extinct shortly after we showed up. Successful domestication is based on the Anna Karenina Syndrome, a name given due to the first line of the novel.Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.IOW, a happy family has many things right while it only takes one of any number of things to make an unhappy one. Plants & animals must have everything right to become domesticated, especially early on. Wheat needed very little modification & we domesticated it (or vice versa) very early while we still don't domesticate oaks because they take so long to mature, breeding characteristics*, & it's so hard to economically pick their acorns due to their size & competition with other animals.(* A complex of genes controls tannin production, so it's very difficult to breed a non-bitter acorn. If only 1 gene were in control, we might have domesticated them (pecans) even if it were a recessive one. Oaks just had too many things wrong.)The proximity to animals & each other also led to more disease. The originating groups of humans survived with immunity, but when they met another group without similar immunity, the new group was often wiped out. Obvious examples are the natives of the Americas & the spread by Europeans of small pox & other diseases.Eurasia also had the most contiguous land along generally the same latitude. This helped spread domesticated plants, animals, diseases, & ideas. North to south, like sub-Saharan Africa or Mexico to South America, is a problem since temperature, hours of daylight, & general climate varies too greatly for many plants & animals to survive a slow expansion across them. While humans could adapt to environments from desert to jungle, their plants, animals, inventions, & diseases often couldn't/didn't.Different environments also slowed humans so not only weren't inventions spread, but there wasn't the pressure to develop/adopt new methods or die. Sub-Saharan Africa is considered an entirely separate area, almost a continent of its own, from northern Africa in terms of evolution. Australia, New Zealand, & Tasmania were all distinct from the rest of the world & even each other.So, the answer to the central question is civilizations developed differently due to their environments:1) The number & variety of plants & animals that were available to domesticate.2) The ease of diffusion & migration within the continent & 3) between continents.4) Continental population size.He really should add a 5th - plain luck. As he points out, in the early 15th century, China was ready to explore the world, but political infighting in their unified government killed the exploration party almost a century before Columbus set out. While Columbus was originally turned down, he had multiple governments to try, one of which eventually opened the doors to expansion which led to many of them - all European - competing around the globe to grab the prizes.The audio edition of this book is abridged, although I hadn't realized that when I started listening & it sure seemed long enough. It wasn't until I got the ebook to see some of the maps & reread certain sections that I realized how much had been cut out.

His synopsis & maunderings in the beginning are interesting only from a historic point of view, although he seems to pretty much have the basics right, so it doesn't invalidate his later conclusions. It does stretch that section out a lot, though. It's cool to see how well a different science has nailed down so many questions & in such a short time.Overall, very good, but a bit dated & long. Grover Gardner did a great job reading this & I'd suggest the abridged version backed by a book since the maps help & reading more in some areas was good."

Well told tale. Persuasive, goodness knows. Maybe even partially correct, who knows, since we're facing the consequences of climate change on our civilization and they aren't good. They're only going to get worse, too. So who do we look to for models of how to change our food production?Anyway, the 2007 revision isn't different in any significant way to the 1997 version and you'll get a lot out of reading it. I still think the 2005 PBS version is the easiest to absorb because there are no awful dreary tables and the pretty pictures are pretty.

210,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
211,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

There were two sentences in this book worth reading, both about ornery animals disemboweling the hapless native folk Dr. Diamond has you hating by the hundredth page. IF THE POLYNESIANS WANT FOOD, MAYBE THEY SHOULD LEAVE POLYNESIA. For chrissakes, your nations barely have names, just two-letter Internet TLD's which get farmed out to continental pornographic concerns and a Hellenicism no more creative than ""Lots-of-Islands-Land"".

It does deal with a lot of hardcore, sometimes too dry, but mostly interesting, archaeological/anthropological/biological/genetical/historical/cultural/geographical/economical/technological developments, facts and insights through which Diamond propounds his basic argument:  why did human development proceed in such different rates on different continents; why certain societies/countries/regions became disproportionately powerful and innovative (while others lagged behind)Starting with human evolution; geological transformation making inroads with development of civilizations; domestication of plants and animals; food production; reasons for growth in population in some regions while others seeing deaths in large numbers, owning to susceptibility to particular germs; leading to factors behind the victory of particular regions/countries/ (race?) over others, this book indeed is an intensive read in terms of research and information.I need a second or third read to fully comprehend the finer points of Diamond's ""whirlwind tour"" nearly 13,000 years of history of almost everybody, but not anytime soon though..."
218,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
219,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
220,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
221,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
222,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
223,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
224,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen.

Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben.

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
232,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
233,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

235,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
236,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
237,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

Author Jared Diamond asked questions, provided many answers and left the remainder for debate. Solid facts along with a challenge to think outside the box are a good combination. Absorbed in deep thought I felt at times that I had drifted back to college days plundering through a textbook, minus the social life, but my spirits lifted with the knowledge that when the “Acknowledgement” section came into view I would not be taking a final exam on my absolute retention. "
240,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
241,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

248,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
249,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
250,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
251,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
252,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
253,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
254,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
262,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
263,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

265,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
266,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
267,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

Author Jared Diamond asked questions, provided many answers and left the remainder for debate. Solid facts along with a challenge to think outside the box are a good combination. Absorbed in deep thought I felt at times that I had drifted back to college days plundering through a textbook, minus the social life, but my spirits lifted with the knowledge that when the “Acknowledgement” section came into view I would not be taking a final exam on my absolute retention. "
270,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
271,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

278,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
279,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
280,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
281,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
282,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
283,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
284,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
292,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
293,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

295,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
296,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
297,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

Author Jared Diamond asked questions, provided many answers and left the remainder for debate. Solid facts along with a challenge to think outside the box are a good combination. Absorbed in deep thought I felt at times that I had drifted back to college days plundering through a textbook, minus the social life, but my spirits lifted with the knowledge that when the “Acknowledgement” section came into view I would not be taking a final exam on my absolute retention. "
300,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
301,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

308,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
309,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
310,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
311,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
312,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
313,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
314,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
322,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
323,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

325,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
326,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
327,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

Author Jared Diamond asked questions, provided many answers and left the remainder for debate. Solid facts along with a challenge to think outside the box are a good combination. Absorbed in deep thought I felt at times that I had drifted back to college days plundering through a textbook, minus the social life, but my spirits lifted with the knowledge that when the “Acknowledgement” section came into view I would not be taking a final exam on my absolute retention. "
330,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
331,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

338,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
339,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
340,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
341,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
342,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
343,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
344,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
352,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
353,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

355,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
356,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
357,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

Author Jared Diamond asked questions, provided many answers and left the remainder for debate. Solid facts along with a challenge to think outside the box are a good combination. Absorbed in deep thought I felt at times that I had drifted back to college days plundering through a textbook, minus the social life, but my spirits lifted with the knowledge that when the “Acknowledgement” section came into view I would not be taking a final exam on my absolute retention. "
360,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
361,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

368,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
369,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
370,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
371,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
372,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
373,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
374,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
382,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
383,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

385,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
386,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
387,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

Author Jared Diamond asked questions, provided many answers and left the remainder for debate. Solid facts along with a challenge to think outside the box are a good combination. Absorbed in deep thought I felt at times that I had drifted back to college days plundering through a textbook, minus the social life, but my spirits lifted with the knowledge that when the “Acknowledgement” section came into view I would not be taking a final exam on my absolute retention. "
390,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
391,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

398,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
399,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
400,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
401,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
402,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
403,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
404,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

This is one of the toughest books I have read, not in terms of vocabulary or sentence construction but dryness. Nevertheless, this is one of the genuine ""books to read before you die"".The author discussed why different continents had different rates of human progress and explains comprehensively that it was not differences in human beings that mattered - it was the flora , fauna and the geographical features that mattered.

I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
412,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
413,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

415,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
416,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
417,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read.

And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
422,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

Interesting theories presented to the pop culture.The theories here are better formated and oraganized than I attribute to Mann, but it still felt like pulp. This book suffers the fate of some critically acclaimed books---many of the ideas and concepts presented in the book are common place or known about today. Nothing really struck me as original---but I freely admit that may be due to the fact that this book was published 23 years ago. Perhaps if I had read it 23 years ago I might have walked away stunned and overwhelmed with the ideas/concepts in the book? That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas. The peak of this book was in the introduction, wherein he talked about the concerns and pitfalls of a book of this nature. The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts. That we can't assume that one way (the Western culture that seems commonplace today) is better than any other way. You also can't assume that the results are preordained or natural.

424,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Excellent overview to anthropology study for homo sapiens' cultures. Why the big divides? Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
425,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."

I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share.

431,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times.

I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
434,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
436,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."
437,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33038-eric-yoo,3,"Premise: The gaps in power and technology among modern human societies can be traced to environmental differences rather than cultural or racial ones. I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other. About agriculture and the domestication of certain animals, and why each are so vital to a society's success. And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose.

440,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
441,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
442,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."

For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."

I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."
445,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"I can perfectly understand why this book is so successful: Diamond works very methodically, takes his reader everywhere by the hand, constantly clarifies his approach and makes very clear conclusions. And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America. That Arabic stems from an African language and that qwerty is not the fastest keyboard!"

It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
452,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

Interesting theories presented to the pop culture.The theories here are better formated and oraganized than I attribute to Mann, but it still felt like pulp.

Perhaps if I had read it 23 years ago I might have walked away stunned and overwhelmed with the ideas/concepts in the book? That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas.

The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts.

454,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Excellent overview to anthropology study for homo sapiens' cultures. Why the big divides? Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
455,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."

I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share. When I later attended another college, it was a cultural anthropology professor that became one of the few still remembered teachers. This culture in which we live, too, shall pass."

461,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

462,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47842317-naia-pard,4,"Disclosure: as the pretty little secondary title would indicate this is indeed a short history of everybody for the last 13.000 years. So, fetch your seat belts and stay put in your seats because the car ride is for the beginners. With that said, this is an introduction to what amounts to be the field work of a lifetime.The edition that I read was the one from the 20th anniversary to which it was added a part that dissected the special situation of Japan`s.Understanding is more often used to try to alter an outcome than to repeat or perpetuate it.p.17I really liked this book. First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times. It gets too dense because the author losses himself in details, at times.But it is a good read. Instagram"
463,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"Full disclosure: I tried to read the book with a fresh mind, but in the end I could not deny that I am biased. I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
464,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
466,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."
467,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33038-eric-yoo,3,"Premise: The gaps in power and technology among modern human societies can be traced to environmental differences rather than cultural or racial ones. I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other.

And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose.

470,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
471,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
472,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."
473,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"From the prologue:""Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."
474,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager,3,"Another get from the town transfer station. I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."
475,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"I can perfectly understand why this book is so successful: Diamond works very methodically, takes his reader everywhere by the hand, constantly clarifies his approach and makes very clear conclusions. And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

476,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41267182-tariq-fadel,5,"we usually tend to think of the pharaohs and the Mesopotamian civilizations as belonging to an ancient time in the history of mankind. This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America. That Arabic stems from an African language and that qwerty is not the fastest keyboard!"
477,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"Its 3.5 stars actually. It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "
478,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15221501-shafi-ibtesham,4,"Great read. One of those books, that I think everyone should read before they die. The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

480,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
481,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

488,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
489,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."

They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
491,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
492,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
493,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
494,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

This is one of the toughest books I have read, not in terms of vocabulary or sentence construction but dryness. Nevertheless, this is one of the genuine ""books to read before you die"".The author discussed why different continents had different rates of human progress and explains comprehensively that it was not differences in human beings that mattered - it was the flora , fauna and the geographical features that mattered.

501,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"I read this soon after it came out. I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
502,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
503,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."

I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
507,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

"
510,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
511,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
519,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
520,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
521,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
522,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
523,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
524,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

This is one of the toughest books I have read, not in terms of vocabulary or sentence construction but dryness. Nevertheless, this is one of the genuine ""books to read before you die"".The author discussed why different continents had different rates of human progress and explains comprehensively that it was not differences in human beings that mattered - it was the flora , fauna and the geographical features that mattered. In effect this shatters overt and covert racism."

The polemics get repetitious and a bit defensive at times, but can be safely skimmed. This would have been a better book had it been written as straight history, letting the facts speak for themselves - but it's still well worth reading. Recommended.

531,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"I read this soon after it came out. I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
532,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
533,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

535,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
536,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
537,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

Author Jared Diamond asked questions, provided many answers and left the remainder for debate. Solid facts along with a challenge to think outside the box are a good combination.

"
540,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
541,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
549,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
550,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
551,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
552,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
553,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
554,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

This is one of the toughest books I have read, not in terms of vocabulary or sentence construction but dryness. Nevertheless, this is one of the genuine ""books to read before you die"".The author discussed why different continents had different rates of human progress and explains comprehensively that it was not differences in human beings that mattered - it was the flora , fauna and the geographical features that mattered. In effect this shatters overt and covert racism."

This would have been a better book had it been written as straight history, letting the facts speak for themselves - but it's still well worth reading. Recommended.

561,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"I read this soon after it came out. I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
562,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
563,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

565,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
566,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
567,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
572,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts. That we can't assume that one way (the Western culture that seems commonplace today) is better than any other way. You also can't assume that the results are preordained or natural. The introduction was superb. 3.5 stars."

Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
575,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."
577,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11928354-chrisl,4,"For me, Diamond isn't a particularly inspiring writer. I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share. When I later attended another college, it was a cultural anthropology professor that became one of the few still remembered teachers. This culture in which we live, too, shall pass."

581,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

582,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47842317-naia-pard,4,"Disclosure: as the pretty little secondary title would indicate this is indeed a short history of everybody for the last 13.000 years. So, fetch your seat belts and stay put in your seats because the car ride is for the beginners. With that said, this is an introduction to what amounts to be the field work of a lifetime.The edition that I read was the one from the 20th anniversary to which it was added a part that dissected the special situation of Japan`s.Understanding is more often used to try to alter an outcome than to repeat or perpetuate it.p.17I really liked this book. First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times. It gets too dense because the author losses himself in details, at times.But it is a good read. Instagram"
583,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"Full disclosure: I tried to read the book with a fresh mind, but in the end I could not deny that I am biased. I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
584,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
586,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."

I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself.

(I constantly sort and give away books, but not this one.)A logical, practical, factual - with a lot of evidence to back it up - history of how we got to where we are today. And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other. About agriculture and the domestication of certain animals, and why each are so vital to a society's success. And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose. Then throw in technology, which, without many exceptions, reads sort of like this: whoever's got the biggest guns (weapons) will win. And all of this with multiple historical examples. Now all or some of this may sound like 'common sense,' like yeah, so what? Isn't all this obvious? Nope, not really, esp. the animals part. Anyhow...This is really just a sorry little review, but I'm summarizing my perceptions from reading it several years ago. Def. a book I need and want to read again.Five stars."

590,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
591,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
592,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."
593,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"From the prologue:""Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."
594,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager,3,"Another get from the town transfer station. I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."
595,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"I can perfectly understand why this book is so successful: Diamond works very methodically, takes his reader everywhere by the hand, constantly clarifies his approach and makes very clear conclusions. And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves. "
596,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41267182-tariq-fadel,5,"we usually tend to think of the pharaohs and the Mesopotamian civilizations as belonging to an ancient time in the history of mankind. This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America. That Arabic stems from an African language and that qwerty is not the fastest keyboard!"
597,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"Its 3.5 stars actually. It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
602,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

Interesting theories presented to the pop culture.The theories here are better formated and oraganized than I attribute to Mann, but it still felt like pulp. This book suffers the fate of some critically acclaimed books---many of the ideas and concepts presented in the book are common place or known about today. Nothing really struck me as original---but I freely admit that may be due to the fact that this book was published 23 years ago. Perhaps if I had read it 23 years ago I might have walked away stunned and overwhelmed with the ideas/concepts in the book? That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas. The peak of this book was in the introduction, wherein he talked about the concerns and pitfalls of a book of this nature. The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts. That we can't assume that one way (the Western culture that seems commonplace today) is better than any other way. You also can't assume that the results are preordained or natural.

Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
605,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."
606,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"From the looks of it the vast majority of audience are listening to this tome as an Audiobook! I confess it makes sense. G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."

I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share. When I later attended another college, it was a cultural anthropology professor that became one of the few still remembered teachers. This culture in which we live, too, shall pass."

611,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

So, fetch your seat belts and stay put in your seats because the car ride is for the beginners. With that said, this is an introduction to what amounts to be the field work of a lifetime.The edition that I read was the one from the 20th anniversary to which it was added a part that dissected the special situation of Japan`s.Understanding is more often used to try to alter an outcome than to repeat or perpetuate it.p.17I really liked this book. First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times. It gets too dense because the author losses himself in details, at times.But it is a good read. Instagram"
613,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"Full disclosure: I tried to read the book with a fresh mind, but in the end I could not deny that I am biased. I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
614,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
616,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."
617,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33038-eric-yoo,3,"Premise: The gaps in power and technology among modern human societies can be traced to environmental differences rather than cultural or racial ones. I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other. About agriculture and the domestication of certain animals, and why each are so vital to a society's success. And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose. Then throw in technology, which, without many exceptions, reads sort of like this: whoever's got the biggest guns (weapons) will win. And all of this with multiple historical examples. Now all or some of this may sound like 'common sense,' like yeah, so what? Isn't all this obvious? Nope, not really, esp. the animals part.

620,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
621,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
622,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."
623,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"From the prologue:""Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."

I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."

And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human.

I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

634,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
635,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."
636,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,5,"This is an important book. The research is outstanding and the author's commitment to his project undeniable. It is a book that everyone should read but might not want to. I am in grad school and have to read several books at a time. This was the book I chose for my light reading outside of class, lol. Diamond traces the origins of civilization from the Fertile Cresent to every corner of the world and his results are well researched, scholarly, and important. I did find however, that the book could be quite dry. The book is around 400 pages but it felt more like a book more than double that length. "
637,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
638,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
639,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
640,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
641,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "
642,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"This wonderful book will be remembered as one of the most important books of the 1990's, and perhaps, the entire 20th Century. Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it. Recommended if you're ok with the cautions I mention above."

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book.

For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes. But he's going on about it for almost forty minutes.So, one day I'll read this.

The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
651,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
652,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
653,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
654,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
655,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try 
Collapse

And specifically by way of explaining Europe's dominance as an accident of environment – species availability, geography, that sort of thing – rather than anything inherent to its peoples or, just as often, anything inherently inferior about the native populations of the rest of the globe.Hmm. An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good. And then I start getting a feeling, just a niggle, like there's something I'm not seeing. And then it slowly dawns on me and I go, "". . . wait . . . wait, no. Really?""What I wasn't seeing here were proper citations. I assumed at first this was an artifact of the audiobook, since they maddeningly cut non-substantive footnotes. (I usually get an e-text to check later, if I am curious. Which I'm me, so I generally am.) But when I checked here, nope, almost nothing.But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."
657,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest,4,"Why did the Europeans become the dominant force of colonization in the late 13th century? Why not the Incans, or the Chinese? Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."
658,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"Very interesting and worthwhile -- won a Pulitzer. I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
659,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "

664,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
665,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."

It is a book that everyone should read but might not want to. I am in grad school and have to read several books at a time. This was the book I chose for my light reading outside of class, lol. Diamond traces the origins of civilization from the Fertile Cresent to every corner of the world and his results are well researched, scholarly, and important. I did find however, that the book could be quite dry. The book is around 400 pages but it felt more like a book more than double that length. "
667,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
668,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
669,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
670,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
671,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it.

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book.

For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes.

The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
681,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
682,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."

This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
684,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
685,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try

And specifically by way of explaining Europe's dominance as an accident of environment – species availability, geography, that sort of thing – rather than anything inherent to its peoples or, just as often, anything inherently inferior about the native populations of the rest of the globe.Hmm. An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good. And then I start getting a feeling, just a niggle, like there's something I'm not seeing. And then it slowly dawns on me and I go, "". . . wait . . . wait, no. Really?""What I wasn't seeing here were proper citations. I assumed at first this was an artifact of the audiobook, since they maddeningly cut non-substantive footnotes. (I usually get an e-text to check later, if I am curious. Which I'm me, so I generally am.) But when I checked here, nope, almost nothing.But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."

Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."
688,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"Very interesting and worthwhile -- won a Pulitzer. I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
689,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "

691,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4995263-robert-jacoby,1,"Title: I see the emperor's new clothes I came late to the party on this one. I had high hopes. Alas, they are dashed. This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
692,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas. The peak of this book was in the introduction, wherein he talked about the concerns and pitfalls of a book of this nature. The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts. That we can't assume that one way (the Western culture that seems commonplace today) is better than any other way. You also can't assume that the results are preordained or natural. The introduction was superb. 3.5 stars."

Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
695,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."
697,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11928354-chrisl,4,"For me, Diamond isn't a particularly inspiring writer. I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share. When I later attended another college, it was a cultural anthropology professor that became one of the few still remembered teachers. This culture in which we live, too, shall pass."

701,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

702,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47842317-naia-pard,4,"Disclosure: as the pretty little secondary title would indicate this is indeed a short history of everybody for the last 13.000 years. So, fetch your seat belts and stay put in your seats because the car ride is for the beginners. With that said, this is an introduction to what amounts to be the field work of a lifetime.The edition that I read was the one from the 20th anniversary to which it was added a part that dissected the special situation of Japan`s.Understanding is more often used to try to alter an outcome than to repeat or perpetuate it.p.17I really liked this book. First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times. It gets too dense because the author losses himself in details, at times.But it is a good read. Instagram"
703,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"Full disclosure: I tried to read the book with a fresh mind, but in the end I could not deny that I am biased. I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
704,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
706,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."
707,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33038-eric-yoo,3,"Premise: The gaps in power and technology among modern human societies can be traced to environmental differences rather than cultural or racial ones. I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

(I constantly sort and give away books, but not this one.)A logical, practical, factual - with a lot of evidence to back it up - history of how we got to where we are today. And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other. About agriculture and the domestication of certain animals, and why each are so vital to a society's success. And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose. Then throw in technology, which, without many exceptions, reads sort of like this: whoever's got the biggest guns (weapons) will win. And all of this with multiple historical examples. Now all or some of this may sound like 'common sense,' like yeah, so what? Isn't all this obvious? Nope, not really, esp. the animals part. Anyhow...This is really just a sorry little review, but I'm summarizing my perceptions from reading it several years ago. Def. a book I need and want to read again.Five stars."

710,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
711,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
712,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."
713,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"From the prologue:""Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."
714,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager,3,"Another get from the town transfer station. I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."
715,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"I can perfectly understand why this book is so successful: Diamond works very methodically, takes his reader everywhere by the hand, constantly clarifies his approach and makes very clear conclusions. And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

716,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41267182-tariq-fadel,5,"we usually tend to think of the pharaohs and the Mesopotamian civilizations as belonging to an ancient time in the history of mankind. This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America. That Arabic stems from an African language and that qwerty is not the fastest keyboard!"

It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

720,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
721,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

There were two sentences in this book worth reading, both about ornery animals disemboweling the hapless native folk Dr. Diamond has you hating by the hundredth page. IF THE POLYNESIANS WANT FOOD, MAYBE THEY SHOULD LEAVE POLYNESIA. For chrissakes, your nations barely have names, just two-letter Internet TLD's which get farmed out to continental pornographic concerns and a Hellenicism no more creative than ""Lots-of-Islands-Land"".

It does deal with a lot of hardcore, sometimes too dry, but mostly interesting, archaeological/anthropological/biological/genetical/historical/cultural/geographical/economical/technological developments, facts and insights through which Diamond propounds his basic argument:  why did human development proceed in such different rates on different continents; why certain societies/countries/regions became disproportionately powerful and innovative (while others lagged behind)Starting with human evolution; geological transformation making inroads with development of civilizations; domestication of plants and animals; food production; reasons for growth in population in some regions while others seeing deaths in large numbers, owning to susceptibility to particular germs; leading to factors behind the victory of particular regions/countries/ (race?) over others, this book indeed is an intensive read in terms of research and information.I need a second or third read to fully comprehend the finer points of Diamond's ""whirlwind tour"" nearly 13,000 years of history of almost everybody, but not anytime soon though..."
728,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
729,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
730,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
731,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
732,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
733,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
734,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."
735,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2846441-karla,2,"Despite a good & engaging start, Diamond's copious word vomit to describe every detail to death (sometimes more than once - the repetition got excruciating towards the end) in the most bland language imaginable kept driving the rating down the further I listened. The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

This is one of the toughest books I have read, not in terms of vocabulary or sentence construction but dryness. Nevertheless, this is one of the genuine ""books to read before you die"".The author discussed why different continents had different rates of human progress and explains comprehensively that it was not differences in human beings that mattered - it was the flora , fauna and the geographical features that mattered. In effect this shatters overt and covert racism."

The polemics get repetitious and a bit defensive at times, but can be safely skimmed. This would have been a better book had it been written as straight history, letting the facts speak for themselves - but it's still well worth reading. Recommended.

741,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"I read this soon after it came out. I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
742,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
743,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

745,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
746,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
747,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
752,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

Interesting theories presented to the pop culture.The theories here are better formated and oraganized than I attribute to Mann, but it still felt like pulp. This book suffers the fate of some critically acclaimed books---many of the ideas and concepts presented in the book are common place or known about today. Nothing really struck me as original---but I freely admit that may be due to the fact that this book was published 23 years ago. Perhaps if I had read it 23 years ago I might have walked away stunned and overwhelmed with the ideas/concepts in the book? That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas. The peak of this book was in the introduction, wherein he talked about the concerns and pitfalls of a book of this nature. The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts. That we can't assume that one way (the Western culture that seems commonplace today) is better than any other way. You also can't assume that the results are preordained or natural.

Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
755,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."

I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share. When I later attended another college, it was a cultural anthropology professor that became one of the few still remembered teachers. This culture in which we live, too, shall pass."

761,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

So, fetch your seat belts and stay put in your seats because the car ride is for the beginners. With that said, this is an introduction to what amounts to be the field work of a lifetime.The edition that I read was the one from the 20th anniversary to which it was added a part that dissected the special situation of Japan`s.Understanding is more often used to try to alter an outcome than to repeat or perpetuate it.p.17I really liked this book. First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times. It gets too dense because the author losses himself in details, at times.But it is a good read. Instagram"
763,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"Full disclosure: I tried to read the book with a fresh mind, but in the end I could not deny that I am biased. I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
764,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
766,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."

I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other. About agriculture and the domestication of certain animals, and why each are so vital to a society's success. And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose. Then throw in technology, which, without many exceptions, reads sort of like this: whoever's got the biggest guns (weapons) will win. And all of this with multiple historical examples. Now all or some of this may sound like 'common sense,' like yeah, so what? Isn't all this obvious? Nope, not really, esp. the animals part.

770,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
771,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
772,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."

For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."

I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."

And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human.

It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

784,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
785,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."
786,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,5,"This is an important book. The research is outstanding and the author's commitment to his project undeniable. It is a book that everyone should read but might not want to. I am in grad school and have to read several books at a time. This was the book I chose for my light reading outside of class, lol. Diamond traces the origins of civilization from the Fertile Cresent to every corner of the world and his results are well researched, scholarly, and important. I did find however, that the book could be quite dry. The book is around 400 pages but it felt more like a book more than double that length. "
787,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
788,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
789,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
790,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
791,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "
792,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"This wonderful book will be remembered as one of the most important books of the 1990's, and perhaps, the entire 20th Century. Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it.

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book.

For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes. But he's going on about it for almost forty minutes.So, one day I'll read this.

The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
801,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
802,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
803,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
804,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
805,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try 
Collapse

And specifically by way of explaining Europe's dominance as an accident of environment – species availability, geography, that sort of thing – rather than anything inherent to its peoples or, just as often, anything inherently inferior about the native populations of the rest of the globe.Hmm. An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good. And then I start getting a feeling, just a niggle, like there's something I'm not seeing. And then it slowly dawns on me and I go, "". . . wait . . . wait, no. Really?""What I wasn't seeing here were proper citations. I assumed at first this was an artifact of the audiobook, since they maddeningly cut non-substantive footnotes. (I usually get an e-text to check later, if I am curious. Which I'm me, so I generally am.) But when I checked here, nope, almost nothing.But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."
807,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest,4,"Why did the Europeans become the dominant force of colonization in the late 13th century? Why not the Incans, or the Chinese? Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."
808,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"Very interesting and worthwhile -- won a Pulitzer. I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
809,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "

814,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
815,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."

It is a book that everyone should read but might not want to. I am in grad school and have to read several books at a time. This was the book I chose for my light reading outside of class, lol. Diamond traces the origins of civilization from the Fertile Cresent to every corner of the world and his results are well researched, scholarly, and important. I did find however, that the book could be quite dry. The book is around 400 pages but it felt more like a book more than double that length. "
817,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
818,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
819,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
820,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
821,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it.

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book.

For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes.

The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
831,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
832,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."

This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
834,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
835,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try

And specifically by way of explaining Europe's dominance as an accident of environment – species availability, geography, that sort of thing – rather than anything inherent to its peoples or, just as often, anything inherently inferior about the native populations of the rest of the globe.Hmm. An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good. And then I start getting a feeling, just a niggle, like there's something I'm not seeing. And then it slowly dawns on me and I go, "". . . wait . . . wait, no. Really?""What I wasn't seeing here were proper citations. I assumed at first this was an artifact of the audiobook, since they maddeningly cut non-substantive footnotes. (I usually get an e-text to check later, if I am curious. Which I'm me, so I generally am.) But when I checked here, nope, almost nothing.But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."
837,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest,4,"Why did the Europeans become the dominant force of colonization in the late 13th century? Why not the Incans, or the Chinese? Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."
838,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"Very interesting and worthwhile -- won a Pulitzer. I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
839,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "

844,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
845,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."

847,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "

With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
849,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
850,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
851,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it. Recommended if you're ok with the cautions I mention above."

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book.

For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes. But he's going on about it for almost forty minutes.So, one day I'll read this.

The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
861,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
862,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
863,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
864,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
865,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try

The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."
867,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest,4,"Why did the Europeans become the dominant force of colonization in the late 13th century? Why not the Incans, or the Chinese? Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."

I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
869,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "

874,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
875,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."

It is a book that everyone should read but might not want to. I am in grad school and have to read several books at a time. This was the book I chose for my light reading outside of class, lol. Diamond traces the origins of civilization from the Fertile Cresent to every corner of the world and his results are well researched, scholarly, and important. I did find however, that the book could be quite dry. The book is around 400 pages but it felt more like a book more than double that length. "
877,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
878,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
879,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
880,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
881,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it. Recommended if you're ok with the cautions I mention above."

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book. Jared Diamond, while I like his theory, is too verbose for my tastes, and prattles on about things that could be covered with a quick summary. For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes. But he's going on about it for almost forty minutes.So, one day I'll read this. I like the theory -- even though I don't think it covers all the reasons why the Europeans came out on top -- just not my taste right now."

The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
891,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
892,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
893,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
894,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
895,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try 
Collapse
 next)."

And specifically by way of explaining Europe's dominance as an accident of environment – species availability, geography, that sort of thing – rather than anything inherent to its peoples or, just as often, anything inherently inferior about the native populations of the rest of the globe.Hmm. An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good. And then I start getting a feeling, just a niggle, like there's something I'm not seeing. And then it slowly dawns on me and I go, "". . . wait . . . wait, no. Really?""What I wasn't seeing here were proper citations. I assumed at first this was an artifact of the audiobook, since they maddeningly cut non-substantive footnotes. (I usually get an e-text to check later, if I am curious. Which I'm me, so I generally am.) But when I checked here, nope, almost nothing.But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."
897,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest,4,"Why did the Europeans become the dominant force of colonization in the late 13th century? Why not the Incans, or the Chinese? Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."
898,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"Very interesting and worthwhile -- won a Pulitzer. I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment.

899,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "
900,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054464-john,1,"This was an utter bore. In all honesty, the points of this book could be better learned by playing Sid Meier's Civilization series.Mr. Diamond starts with a question (framed by a question from a New Guinean friend as to why white people are materially richer) and comes up with an answer that can be explained in a page or two. Yet, Mr. Diamond devotes over 400 pages to discussing stuff. The book is extremely repetitive, as he keeps reminding the reader of his conclusions in previous chapters, and runs through crop histories for pages on end. Reading the last chapter is enough to obtain an understanding of Guns, Germs, and Steel.Basically, the world is divided into Eurasia on one end, and the Americas, Africa, and Oceana at the other end. Because Eurasia is so big from east to west without insurmountable barriers, it had more mammals and crops capable of domestication, and had a better way of diffusing crop and animal domestication (and, in turn, technology) to other societies in relative climates. By contrast, the rest of the world didn't, since their north-south narrowness creates too many diverse climates for diffusing crops, or they faced too many geographic barriers. This takes 400 pages of explaining, somehow. Without crops and animals, societies in the other parts of the world didn't have huge population jumps, resistance to diseases from animals, or advanced technology. The end.Mr. Diamond admits that he doesn't explain why only Western Eurasia came to dominate the world instead of the other societies in Eurasia, then he proceeds to an explanation for a few pages (that would've been a more interesting topic). To sum up his final theory, Europe was less integrated, but integrated enough to compete with one another technologically. China was too integrated, and Mesopotamia killed their trees and became a desert. Well, golly."

In case this question immediately makes you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatise, you aren't: as you will see, the answers to the question don't involve human racial differences at all. The book's emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back the chain of historical causation as far as possible.Science writing just doesn't get any better than this. Everyone should read this book. It explains why some societies advanced more rapidly than others and the differences between the victors and the vanquished. I don't know if Professor Diamond came up with all of these brilliant observations, but he gets credit for writing the best book about them. I have given this book to at least a half dozen of my friends and relatives. You're welcome.After reading a couple of one and two star reviews I’ve noticed that they all seem to point towards some sort of racism in this book. These days unless you aren’t calling someone else a racist then obviously you are a racist. Is that about it? A lot of people said the book was boring or poorly written. I didn’t find that to be true, quite the opposite. I’ve read it twice. The ideas put forth in this book were novel to me and make complete sense. If there is a better way to explain the course of history it’s still waiting for me to find it. The critics never post another work we all should be reading. I learned an awful lot about plant and animal domestication and his theory of how geography played such an important part in human development was brilliant. "

The simple fact is that the different climates led to different germs, crops, and domesticated animals. All of these factors led to how easy a society became ""civilized."" It's as simple as that but a lot of the things Diamond brought up had never occurred to me.This book explains why we don't:- Have Hunting Cheetahs- Eat Lion Burgers- Grow acorns and eat them- Why the new world died from european diseases and not the other way aroundInteresting stuff but not quite the breathtaking game changer it had been built up to be."

This book provides a good antidote for racist or supremacist theories about the differences in development of different societies and a solid base for refutation of heroic narratives that distort history.Germs, for instance, were one of the major weapons that conquerers had, when they collided with native peoples. In some cases, 90% and more of the invaded were killed by a disease brought by the invading army.Jared Diamond writes about the differences the continents had that made plant and animal domestication initiate and develop at very different speeds. And goes on to show the effect that had on the cultures that arose after food production and domestic animals allowed for bigger populations, and more complex societies."

In many ways, what we end up with is an ambitious ""theory"" of world history derived from first-principles.Fair warning, the book is heavy on details about the histories of specific crops and so on which gets a bit dull for the casual reader, but if the premise is at all interesting to you, you will come out the other end feeling a lot less mystified about the large-scale course of world history.PS: See CGP Grey's ""Americapox: The Missing Plague"" video at https://youtu.be/JEYh5WACqEk for a really good summary of the ""germs"" part of this book."

Spanning the period since the beginnings of animal domestication and settled agriculture, it attempts to answer the question as to why particular regions of the globe developed when they did, socio-economically speaking, and why others never developed societies more advanced than hunter-gatherers. Diamond, a professional scientist and amateur historian, adduces a plausible argument based on environmental givens, an hypothesis with a great carrying capacity.This environmentally-deterministic study is counterbalanced by his later work, Collapse, which treats of the matter of the success and failure of human societies. Here social practices, human behaviors, are determinative, but once again in terms of environmental givens.The subtext to both volumes, what I read into them throughout, was an argument against genetic determinism--in other words, against racism.

The answer seems to come down to the ability to produce food through agriculture, which in turn allows for greater population density and faster innovation. Diamond acknowledges the influences of elements like politics, culture, and the Great Man theory, but notes how much less impact these had than environmental factors. Admittedly I lost steam on this one because of the repetition of tracing environmental factors through several regions of the world, but the cases presented were interesting and convincing."

922,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,3,"Guns, Germs, and Steel is basically an answer to the question, ""If Europeans aren't innately superior, why did they end up running everything for so long?"" Or, in the words of a New Guinean given in the beginning of the book:Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?For me, the best metaphor to frame the whole book in is in terms of a game of Civilization. And while I'm sure most anthropologists and ethnologists are even now launching themselves at the screen with their hands reaching for my neck, I'll lay out my case. Civilization IV has a lot of problems as an accurate model of human history and societal interaction (for example, technology as a tree), but it does demonstrate a lot of Diamond's points.For example, locally available resources. In Civilization IV, if you don't have any sulfur, you can't make gunpowder. If you don't have gunpowder, you'll get steamrolled by any civilization who does unless you trade for it--and if you do that, you're at the mercy of the civilization that's providing it for you, and G-d help you if they declare war on you, because you'll lose your ability to make gunpowder units and get stomped.Second, trade. Civilizations that trade technological innovations often advance much faster than a single civilization that tries to turtle up and go Galt (which is my usual strategy...), and it's not unusually to end up behind the tech curve and run into a cavalry vs. tanks situation when expanding out beyond your traditional borders.Third, terrain. Mountains blocking expansion and trade are bad. Starting in the jungle is bad. Lack of natural resources are bad. Small islands are bad. Deserts are bad. All of those make expansion much more difficult and limit your population, which reduces the rate of your technological progress, so you advance slower, have less to trade, and eventually your cavalry gets steamrolled by tanks.There are plenty of points Guns, Germs, and Steel makes that Civilization simply doesn't cover, though, lest you think that playing a video game will provide the same educational experience. For one, disease vectors--a.k.a., why didn't the Europeans get wiped out by super plagues from the Americas? The simple answer is animals. The Eurasian civilizations lived in very close proximity to animals for most of their existence and most of the really serious diseases that affected humans in the past--smallpox, black plague, flu, and so on--were originally animal diseases that made the jump. The cultures in the Americans simply did not have the same range of animals as the Eurasian cultures did, so they had little exposure to animal-borne diseases and hence little resistance to them, and therefore both died in droves and did not inflict a similar fate on Europeans. The popular image of North America as a pristine wilderness is wrong--it wasn't a wilderness, it was a post-apocalyptic wasteland.Though as an interesting note, Diamond points out that when syphillis first appeared, it was a horrific disease that literally caused people's flesh to rot off and killed in months. It mutated shortly after its initially appearance into the insanity-causing, long-term disease we know today, however, and so Europe never experienced The Years of Rice and Salt.(note that whether syphillis actually came from the Americas is still somewhat controversial)Similarly, Civilization doesn't have climate bands, but they were hugely important in world history. Eurasia is oriented east-west, with a similar latitude and climate the whole length, and a contiguous land route to travel along, so it was easy for animals and plants tamed in one place (mostly the Middle East) to spread all along that climactic band to each of those civilizations. In contrast, the Americas are oriented north-south, with desert or mountain barriers in places, and Australia and Oceania have large expanses of water making trade harder and populations smaller in addition to latitude differences. It was difficult to get crops from one place to another, and because it took longer, there was a lower population for a longer time, which reduced the potential for innovation due to a lower possible number of inventors, thus leading to a technological gap which, in combination with the smallpoxalypse, led to the cultural and physical near-extermination of the Native Americans.That part, at least, is familiar to players of Civilization. More food means more people, which means more science and production, which means faster advancement, and it all feeds into each other until you're the ones with tanks stomping everyone else.Okay, enough about Civilization. Anyway, that's Diamond's theory, but there are a few problems with Guns, Germs, and Steel.For one, it is incredibly dry and boring. I often had to force myself to keep reading, and I'd get a few more pages in before I got distracted by something new and interesting. At least twice, I almost fell asleep while I was reading it. There are other reviews mentioning that it took them up to six months to finally finish the entire book, so be warned.Second, there are no footnotes. For a book like this, I'd expect dozens of pages of footnotes meticulously documenting all his assumptions, but that never happens, and it's much to the book's detriment.Third, for a book about why Europeans dominated the world, it's mostly focused on the far past--as Diamond phrases it, on the question I quoted at the beginning of the review. The actual process of domination isn't covered at all except for a brief section about the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas.Finally, and most damningly, the section at the end where Diamond talks about China actually serves to lever open the cracks in his argument. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, China and the Middle East were far more advanced than Europe was, and they also lie in the same Eurasian climactic band that Diamond proposes gave the civilizations within a competitive advantage. So, why is it that neither of them conquered everyone? Diamond has two explanations for this. For China, he claims that China's more continuous government worked against it, because it was possible for the government to ban sea exploration (as actually happened) and have it stick, whereas in Europe when Columbus was trying to finance a sea expedition, he could move from government to government when each successive one turned him down until he found some suckers to finance him.The problem is...this is a cultural explanation. It's saying that China didn't dominate the world because of cultural factors. And if that happened in China, why couldn't it have happened elsewhere. Did the Spanish beat the Aztecs who outnumbered them 100 to 1 because of their geography allowing them to develop superior technology, or was it because the Aztecs exacted ruinous tribute from their client states, causing their subjects to hate them and attach themselves to the first people who looked likely to overthrow their hated rulers? Did the Middle East fail to conquer the world because of increasing desertification and the movement of productive agriculture north and west, as Diamond states, or was it because the Mongols smashed through the states there, burned Baghdad to the ground, and destroyed the system of irrigation canals dating back to the Sumerians, causing a population collapse that Iraq did not recover from until the 20th century? Japan proved that it was perfectly capable of dominating all its neighbors after its modernization during the Meiji Restoration, so clearly it wasn't geography holding it back. Was it the Edo period's 
sakoku
 policy? Because that's another cultural explanation. Diamond spends the entire book talking about geographic and climactic factors being the main reason for the dominance of civilizations, and then chops his argument's legs off in the last 10 pages. The most obvious explanation is that it's a combination of these factors, but that's not what Guns, Germs, and Steel is about. The entire book is an argument for the primacy of geographical factors in determining why the Europeans came to be dominant over the last 500 years, but there are just too many holes and too few citations in the argument for it to be really effective. It's useful to add to the historiography of the European conquest and displacement of most of the rest of the world, but in no way should it be taken as a definitive text."
923,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.Why is economic development so uneven around the world?Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. “Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?” “[W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents?” “[W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel?” In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a “unified synthesis”—a unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.Academic critics howledHowever, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel: They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. That’s nitpicking, as far as I’m concerned. And many of these “errors” could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories. Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamond’s book, it’s insulting to the reader. The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of “environmental determinism.” Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factors—but he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything we’ve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined. There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didn’t) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamond’s critics never read the book. However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, that’s no error. He didn’t pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.Is it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadn’t cited their own specialized research?The roots of academic criticismThough the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamond’s expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. It’s not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as “not serious.” And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.A wealth of meaning behind the titleTo understand where the academic critics went wrong, it’s useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. “The immediate reasons for Pizarro’s success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.”Diamond’s argument in a nutshellIn a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: “‘Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?'” To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. It’s unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the “civilization” in which we live.Diamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa—and the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United States—impeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the “guns, germs, and steel” that made Eurasian dominance possible—and dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.Guns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesn’t make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, you’ll find this book highly rewarding."
924,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22548315-zachary-f,4,"In a cultural climate where avowed white supremacists regularly make headlines and elected officials can claim with a straight face that people of color have contributed nothing to world history, Guns, Germs and Steel remains as sadly relevant as it was when first published 20 years ago. Jared Diamond's thesis--that some people groups have historically triumphed over others not because they were made up of innately superior human beings, but rather because of the environmental factors that shaped their societies and fostered technological growth--is so simple and seemingly self-apparent that it’s hard to believe anyone ever had to write a book to prove it. And yet, as the examples above demonstrate, someone did--and a loud western minority (majority?) has still not gotten the message. This book won the Pulitzer and looms large in the pop history genre to this day, so I won’t spend too much time discussing its merits or breaking down its case point by point. Diamond argues persuasively and in great detail that, while humans themselves are pretty much the same everywhere, the environments in which our ancestors had to eke out their livings were not. Some parts of the globe (most notably the huge landmass comprising modern Europe, Asia, and North Africa) yielded an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species, along with the climate necessary to take advantage of these, while other regions did not lend themselves to farming in the same way. Agriculture led to food surpluses and sedentary living, which in turn led to denser populations, increased social and political stratification, and more time and resources for non-essential crafts and trades. With proximity to animals and large, concentrated groups of humans also came more diverse and complex diseases, and eventually immunity or resistance to these diseases. Finally, while the Eurasian landmass is oriented on an east-west axis, meaning that crops, animals, and ideas can spread thousands of miles in a short amount of time with no significant change in climate or environment type, the north-south axes of Africa and the Americas (complete with their own vast deserts and rainforests) make such sharing far more difficult. It’s not that so-called ""primitive"" societies are in any way worse than so-called ""advanced"" ones (Diamond claims that hunter-gatherers are actually better nourished on average than farmers, and they certainly seem no less happy), but they lack the biological, technological, and political advantages that large, sedentary societies possess. When a society armed with guns, horses, and deadly diseases comes against one without, the resulting conquest has nothing to do with the “genetic superiority” of the victors and everything to do with their material assets. Diamond is a biologist by trade, not a historian or an anthropologist, and he is at his best when describing the scientific principles behind the broad sweep of human history. He tends to falter when dealing with more specific details of history and culture, as when he claims that ""Like Arabs and Jews, Koreans and Japanese are peoples joined by blood, yet locked in traditional enmity"" (449). (The notion that Jews and Muslims are natural enemies is a popular one in this day and age, but totally unsupported by history; I suspect the relationship between Korea and Japan is more nuanced than he gives it credit for being, too.) Diamond's style can be dry and a bit repetitive, and he gives New Guinea (his adoptive homeland) what seems like a disproportionate amount of attention. There is also a subtle but unpleasant tinge of social Darwinism in his treatment of imperialism: he never attempts to explain why technologically-advanced peoples always seem to prey on their weaker neighbors, only how they do so--the implication being that such conflicts are inevitable whenever there is a power imbalance and that physical prowess is, in itself, justification for conquest. I don't think Diamond is intentionally advocating for the survival of the fittest (that would be at odds with the whole central thrust of his argument), but in a book whose express purpose is to explain why some peoples have come to dominate others, it seems like a pretty major oversight to neglect the motives of the people in question.Nevertheless, Diamond deserves credit for such a comprehensive and lucid treatment of an enormous and multifaceted topic. His arguments are rigorous, he treats his subjects with an even hand and fitting respect, and it's clear that his goal is to empower the oppressed rather than to glorify their oppressors. Recommended to anyone interested in why the world is how it is and unsatisfied with the reductive, self-serving rhetoric of our time and place."
925,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232965-zain-hashmy,4,"Guns, Germs and Steel deserves two reviews, because writing one cannot do it justice. The first part of my review will be objective, and will concern general readers. The second part of my review will be personal and will deal with how I felt while reading this book. I'm writing this review now, with the details fresh in my mind, having finished the book only moments ago.Guns, Germs and Steel attempts to answer a complex geopolitical question ; Why have the Europeans emerged as the dominant power in the world, while many other native populations died out? Classically, the answer to this question is racist. In this book, Jared Diamond has explained through careful examination and observation why that racist answer should be consigned to oblivion. The question is addressed over 19 chapters, each of them covering as much ground as possible, to give a broad perspective and scope, with scientific studies and research to back up every claim. The argument stands tall on the basis of good science, spruced-up logic and well grounded theories. The average reader will delight in the simplicity of the book, and how the concepts are explained in great detail without excessive jargon. Jared goes over the rise and fall of civilizations, the modern day players, the development of technologies, and every anthropological factor that might possibly hold a clue. He treats this question as a giant puzzle, and gently assembles the pieces together to make the outline of a picture. Moreover, he himself admits that this is merely the outline of the picture, and the gaps need to be filled in by other writers, and more knowledge. That makes the book endearing, because the author understands the scope of the project, and acknowledges his own limitations. The writing style is somewhat verbose, and would benefit from some hack-n-slash editing, but overall, it remains an excellent book for most readers. Part 2.Unfortunately, I'm not one of those readers. Time to rant a bit. WHYY is the book so slow? I understand that he's trying to not be racist, but treading on eggshells all the way through the book, giving multiple explanations and scenarios to justify the same theory becomes taxing. Frustratingly enough, I understand the need to do that. It took one book, Madison's 'Passing of the Races', to inspire a man like Hitler into committing genocide, so this is probably a topic to tread carefully around. That doesn't make the argument style ANY less annoying. The explanations are drawn out and EVERY single detail is highlighted. With a background in Biotechnology and a strong interest in related sciences, I find his overexplanation of the subject terribly draining in many places. Furthermore, there are a few flaws in the argument, which I will discuss once a few other people have finished reading the book, and I've had a solid discussion with them. In simple terms, a normal scientific book will usually explain a concept at the start of the book, and for the rest of the book, will assume that you know the concept, so as to not double back on explanations. Not Mr. Diamond, noooo. I agree that this book should be made mandatory for anyone with a racist temperament, and their intelligence likely requires the repeated explanations but most people don't. I would happily recommend this book to an average person, but I would think ten times before recommending it to any of my friends because they are likely to get bored and abandon it halfway.More discussion on the flaws in theory is yet to come."
926,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,3,"Why did Europe succeed?27 December 2012	This is one of those books that tries to ask the question of why the European civilisation managed to succeed where all other world civilisations failed. His conclusions are interesting, however we must remember that even now, fifteen years after this book was completed we are seeing an economic collapse in the west against an economic resurgence in China, India, and Brazil.	One of the ideas that he had was due to the axis of the continents. The only continent on a horizontal axis is the Eurasian mega-continent, which means that the entire continent is located in the temperate zone. However I find that idea to be a little dubious. Okay, granted, major civilisations arose across the continent: Europe, Arabia, India, and China; and trade existed among these four civilisations, however it does not really account for the rise of Europe to the exclusion of the rest.	One interesting idea I would suggest is to do with the Mongol hordes that smashed across Asia and the Middle East. In a way the Middle East never recovered from those invasions, and China was knocked back hundreds of years. Europe, by pure chance, managed to be spared, which meant that they were able to continue to develop ahead of the other Eurasian powers. This also resulted in them developing shipping which enabled them to take control of the Arabian Sea from the Arabs (since the land routes had been subsequently blocked by the Mongols).	The idea of trade along a horizontal axis is interesting, and we note that there was not much trade between the civilisations of America. Even then simple trade is unlikely to be hindered by tropical conditions. One thing about the American tribes is that they never developed shipping, which would have been something that prevented them from trading over long distances. In Africa we don't see much in the way of trade either, and the closer you get to the equator, the less developed the nations you encounter.	The concept of germs is interesting in that disease is a barrier to development. With malaria in the tropics it makes development of civilisation there difficult at best, and this can also prove a hindrance to trade, and Malaria is a disease that does not thrive well in colder climates. We also note that the common cold wrecked havoc in the Americas, where as the only disease we inherited from the New World was chlamydia, which is a sexually transmitted disease (the common cold is airbourne). However, that does not mean that Europe had been spared its devastating diseases, as the black plague ran rampant for over five hundred years and accounted for the death of up to a third of the population at its height.	Guns and steel deal more with technological development. The Eurasian civilisations had steel and guns were imported from China, but some suggest that the Chinese never used gunpower for weapons. That is rubbish. The Chinese had developed and were using explosives and rockets in warfare, but that did not save them from the Mongol Hordes. Even then, guns were a pretty poor weapon up until the eighteenth century, and were still quite inadequate. It wasn't until the 20th century that their truly devastating power comes into play.	The the balkanised nature of the European states also has a part to play. There is a point in that because there are all these competing countries all trying to gain an advantage over the other, which results in a perpetual arms race. That did not happen in China because the Chinese government pretty much controlled the entire region. However, that does not account for the fact that such balkanisation existed in the Americas and Africa. This also existed to an extent in the Middle East and India, but both of these regions, for a long time, have been under the dominant power of a single empire (the Ottomans in the Middle East and the Mogols, and later the British, in India). 	To me, the only real answer to this is that not only was Europe spared the ravaging of the Mongol hordes, but that we Europeans are in reality a sadistic and savage lot who are always looking for faster and more sophisticated ways of killing each other. It is not that the Native Americans lived in peace, they didn't, it was just that they were satisfied with using basic weapons. Even when they did have access to guns, they took them and then turned them on each other."
927,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"The title “Guns, Germs and Steel” invokes in one’s mind the image of clacking metals and blazing guns. Then you suddenly realize you forgot about the germs part because you had no idea how to work gooey pathogens into such an awesome visual. In retrospect, however, you feel like Germs should have been the focal point of this title. Upon further musings, you reject that notion too and want to settle for something more mundane like “A brief history of post-Pleistocene humanity”. Maybe a more riveting title would have driven sales in the upward direction, but the central question that this book sets out to answer is no cakewalk: “Why did history take such divergent trajectories in the different continents?” Why indeed?Different variants of the same question have been posed for quite some time: “Why did Africa fail to launch a single civilization in the past 10,000 years or so?” “Of all the landmasses in the world, why did Eurasia enjoy a such massive headstart in creating giant empires, like the Roman empire in Italy or the Shang Dynasty in China?” “Why did Australian aborigines fail to move beyond the stone age on a timescale of thousands of years whereas the Europeans succeeded in creating and sustaining a modern nation state within two centuries of landing on the western coast of the continent?”Many answers have been proposed and depending on your worldview, you may prefer one over several others. In the pre-Renaissance era, the view of most people pondering over such matters can be summarized in a simple sentence: “They are filthy savages, we are civilized humans. That’s it” With the advent of biological evolution, efforts were made to recast the answer in more scientific terms: “Just as the Cro-Magnons were an evolutionary upgrade on the Neanderthals, so are we (Europeans/ Caucasians) a more advanced form of humans vis-à-vis the blacks/aborigines/Indians.” In retrospect, it might sound hilarious, but at that time, serious research works were carried out to show that Africans have a more primitive skull structure akin to the Chimpanzees. And then came Mendel with genetics and it did not take much time for people to weaponize that concept either. The Nazis believed they were a genetically superior race and actively carried out eugenics to optimize favorable hereditary characteristics among their people, despite zero science to back up such a genocidal social policy. To this day, the genetic superiority theory has no shortage of preachers and evangelists. The likes of Sam Harris and Jordan Petersen are going around the globe and brandishing psychologist Charles Murray’s Race-and-Intelligence Bell Curve. The implication is pretty straightforward, “Look mate, even if slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the likes did not happen, the African Americans would still be hard-pressed to climb up the social ladder since they are genetically indisposed to do so. Sad!!” The appropriation of scientific concepts by intellectuals of the social science disciplines to justify confounding claims is nothing new. And as I have already stated, each individual would be amenable to a different answer to this question depending on how he/she perceives the world-at-large. So, in the marketplace of ideas, who should we subscribe to? In other words, which discipline or branch of science is best-suited to answer this question? And the answer is: Anthropology. Wild as it may seem at first, you would think the responsibility to answer a question regarding humans should befell the people whose job is to literally study humans.And this is where this book shines brightly. Jared Diamond does a fantastic job of breaking down the geographical, agricultural, political and social forces that propelled different people to very disparate directions. But most importantly, this book stands as a solid buttress to human capital. Given the right tools and right conditions of existence, anyone possesses the mental faculty to do anything they would want to do. No one is genetically incapacitated to be an engineer or a physicist. But if you choose to believe otherwise, that is your prerogative. Just read the book and see if it can challenge, if not alter radically, your worldview. "
928,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145461-rindis,3,"To a certain extent, I've always wondered why Guns, Germs, and Steel caused such a huge splash. The main premise boils down to 'differences in geography cause differences in societies and their history', which belongs to the club of the blindingly obvious.Of course, the real point of the book is to pin down just which differences are the important ones. This is a cause for much arguement, but Diamond has successfully pulled out the most important ones as applied to history as a whole. This largely turns into a study of what plants and animals were successfully domesticated in early prehistory, and how that turned certain areas into the origin of settled agriculture. That is still fairly basic stuff, but benefits greatly from studying the results from all around the world all at once, and examining just what it takes for something to be capable of being domesticated. (I know there's been some interesting work done on that since this book came out, but I haven't seen it escape scholarly journals in more detail than a National Geographic article.)From there, Diamond points out how plants and animals are generally adapted to a certain climate, and that while it is fairly easy to find different climates going east and west (due to cold mountains, dry deserts, wet coasts, and other accidents of geology), large differences of climate are guaranteed when traveling any real distance north and south. Looking at a map and noting that the Americas and Africa are divided into north-south zones, while Eurasia is oriented east-west, then provides material to show why certain areas needed to work everything out independently, while others were able to borrow everything they needed from elsewhere (before the Age of Exploration, the two situations were probably somewhat even by landmass; the book naturally spends much more time looking at the former).The main thing that makes this book new is actually the 'germs' part of the book. It is only fairly recently that we've really become aware of where most of the deadly diseases we have to deal with come from—other animals. So societies that have and live closely with lots of domesticatible animals get to suffer from deadly epidemics when an occasional virus adapts to a new host (us), and then develop some level of immunity to it. When people who don't have much/anything in the way of domesticated animals run into people who do, they die off as multiple epidemics run through the countryside. This is the other 'new' part—the fact that a lot of Native American population was wiped out by disease is well known, but it's been hard to realize the scale of the disaster. The ""Mound Builders"" were a disappeared pre-Columbian civilization of the Mississippi valley, and only recently has it been realized it was actually wiped out by European diseases before any Europeans got there to see it.The 'guns' and 'steel' parts of the book are essentially non-existent. They just serve as part of the proximate cause of how Europeans came to dominate the world before turning to look for the ultimate causes back in prehistory. This is where his biases as a biologist who's picked up a fair amount of practical cultural anthropology show. While he does discuss technology, and the fact that the wider the range of where you can get ideas from, the more ideas you will be able to encounter, he doesn't spend any time looking at the basics of physical technology. A basic study of easily available copper, tin, iron, and clay deposits, compared with the areas that were able to develop settled agriculture could explain much that remains mysterious to him.It's decidedly a layman's book, and has the advantage of being aware of more current research than any pre-college textbook. The fairly breezy, non-technical writing is set off by a good number of informative charts and maps and allow him to make his points without miring himself in the minutia that would lose the non-dedicated reader. Just being able to tackle most of pre-history in a single reasonably-sized volume is an impressive feat of summarization, and the most impressive thing about the book."

Abdullah Ocalan seems to have done a better job writing with the extremely limited resources allowed him by his jailers than authors like Francis Fukuyama or Jared Diamond did with access to the world's finest research libraries."" — David GraeberThe conditions of which David Graeber speaks are that of being locked up in solitary confinement with 24 hour/day artificial light illuminating his cell. Allowed to have one book at a time, and oftimes no writing instruments. And the book(s) he wrote were communicated to the public via live speach, or in first draft form written hastily as part of his testimony for his trials.So, is Jared Diamond's book that bad that a guy who's locked up in such brutal conditions can do better? Well, not really. It is almost certain that Jared Diamond reveals important factors that went into the emergence and differentiation of variagrated civilization, it's just that his analysis is definitely incomplete by simple virtue of being more materialistic than that of any hardline marxist. There is very few, and ultimately unconvincing, arguments about the formation of institutions, the emergence of cities, and ultimately of nation-states. And almost no mention of any social movement of any kind.True to the title, the red thread woven through the entire analysis of civilization is done by looking at why certain societies had developed guns, germs, and steel the way they have. It presents rather novel ideas for the layperson not versed in the subject. A quick, and woefully incomplete, enumeration being:1) Euroasia had a geographical advantage because it had more indigenous crops that could potentially be domesticated2) The domestication of said plants could spread from the Fertile Crescent where they first emerged more easily because of relatively uniform climate along the longer axis (east-west) of Eurasia. The Americas suffering from the fact that their longest geographical distance was from north-south, thus cross-cutting through extremely different climates3) Eurasia also had more potential animals for domestication (also goes into why some species are better suited than others), thus Eurasians had a very decisive advantage in terms of the diseases that they developed resistance too, since most ones are of animal origin And so on. You get the picture, right? Fairly solid arguments, and worth carefully studying because they can almost immediately shut up racists, euro-centrists, and so on. But do not think that by reading this book you have garnered enough information about early human history to call it quits. It might be enough to show off at certain parties, but in order to actually synthesise new ways forward there's a long list of problems, not even touched upon, by Jared Diamond."
930,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
931,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

938,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
939,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."

They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."

Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
942,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
943,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
944,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

This is one of the toughest books I have read, not in terms of vocabulary or sentence construction but dryness. Nevertheless, this is one of the genuine ""books to read before you die"".The author discussed why different continents had different rates of human progress and explains comprehensively that it was not differences in human beings that mattered - it was the flora , fauna and the geographical features that mattered. In effect this shatters overt and covert racism."

This would have been a better book had it been written as straight history, letting the facts speak for themselves - but it's still well worth reading. Recommended.

951,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"I read this soon after it came out. I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
952,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
953,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

955,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"3.5 starsThis is an interesting and influential book that in its broad conclusions makes a lot of sense, though I have doubts about Diamond’s reasoning on some of his smaller points. It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."

I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
957,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

964,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
965,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."

967,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
968,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
969,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
970,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
971,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it.

For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes. But he's going on about it for almost forty minutes.So, one day I'll read this.

The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
981,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
982,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
983,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
984,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
985,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try

The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people.

Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."

I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment.

Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
992,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts.

Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
995,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."

There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share.

Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

1002,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47842317-naia-pard,4,"Disclosure: as the pretty little secondary title would indicate this is indeed a short history of everybody for the last 13.000 years. So, fetch your seat belts and stay put in your seats because the car ride is for the beginners. With that said, this is an introduction to what amounts to be the field work of a lifetime.The edition that I read was the one from the 20th anniversary to which it was added a part that dissected the special situation of Japan`s.Understanding is more often used to try to alter an outcome than to repeat or perpetuate it.p.17I really liked this book. First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times. It gets too dense because the author losses himself in details, at times.But it is a good read. Instagram"
1003,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"Full disclosure: I tried to read the book with a fresh mind, but in the end I could not deny that I am biased. I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
1004,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
1006,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."
1007,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33038-eric-yoo,3,"Premise: The gaps in power and technology among modern human societies can be traced to environmental differences rather than cultural or racial ones. I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

1010,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
1011,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
1012,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."
1013,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"From the prologue:""Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."
1014,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager,3,"Another get from the town transfer station. I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."
1015,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"I can perfectly understand why this book is so successful: Diamond works very methodically, takes his reader everywhere by the hand, constantly clarifies his approach and makes very clear conclusions. And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

1016,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41267182-tariq-fadel,5,"we usually tend to think of the pharaohs and the Mesopotamian civilizations as belonging to an ancient time in the history of mankind. This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America. That Arabic stems from an African language and that qwerty is not the fastest keyboard!"
1017,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"Its 3.5 stars actually. It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

1021,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4995263-robert-jacoby,1,"Title: I see the emperor's new clothes I came late to the party on this one. I had high hopes. Alas, they are dashed. This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
1022,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

I do not know why but for some reason I've thought of this book as belonging to the Charles Mann genre of history. Interesting theories presented to the pop culture.The theories here are better formated and oraganized than I attribute to Mann, but it still felt like pulp. This book suffers the fate of some critically acclaimed books---many of the ideas and concepts presented in the book are common place or known about today. Nothing really struck me as original---but I freely admit that may be due to the fact that this book was published 23 years ago. Perhaps if I had read it 23 years ago I might have walked away stunned and overwhelmed with the ideas/concepts in the book? That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas. The peak of this book was in the introduction, wherein he talked about the concerns and pitfalls of a book of this nature. The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts. That we can't assume that one way (the Western culture that seems commonplace today) is better than any other way. You also can't assume that the results are preordained or natural. The introduction was superb. 3.5 stars."

Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
1025,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."

I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share. When I later attended another college, it was a cultural anthropology professor that became one of the few still remembered teachers. This culture in which we live, too, shall pass."

1031,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

1032,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47842317-naia-pard,4,"Disclosure: as the pretty little secondary title would indicate this is indeed a short history of everybody for the last 13.000 years. So, fetch your seat belts and stay put in your seats because the car ride is for the beginners. With that said, this is an introduction to what amounts to be the field work of a lifetime.The edition that I read was the one from the 20th anniversary to which it was added a part that dissected the special situation of Japan`s.Understanding is more often used to try to alter an outcome than to repeat or perpetuate it.p.17I really liked this book. First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times. It gets too dense because the author losses himself in details, at times.But it is a good read. Instagram"
1033,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"Full disclosure: I tried to read the book with a fresh mind, but in the end I could not deny that I am biased. I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
1034,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
1036,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."

I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

(I constantly sort and give away books, but not this one.)A logical, practical, factual - with a lot of evidence to back it up - history of how we got to where we are today. And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other. About agriculture and the domestication of certain animals, and why each are so vital to a society's success. And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose. Then throw in technology, which, without many exceptions, reads sort of like this: whoever's got the biggest guns (weapons) will win. And all of this with multiple historical examples. Now all or some of this may sound like 'common sense,' like yeah, so what? Isn't all this obvious? Nope, not really, esp. the animals part. Anyhow...This is really just a sorry little review, but I'm summarizing my perceptions from reading it several years ago. Def. a book I need and want to read again.Five stars."

1040,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
1041,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
1042,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."
1043,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"From the prologue:""Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."
1044,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager,3,"Another get from the town transfer station. I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."
1045,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"I can perfectly understand why this book is so successful: Diamond works very methodically, takes his reader everywhere by the hand, constantly clarifies his approach and makes very clear conclusions. And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

1046,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41267182-tariq-fadel,5,"we usually tend to think of the pharaohs and the Mesopotamian civilizations as belonging to an ancient time in the history of mankind. This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America. That Arabic stems from an African language and that qwerty is not the fastest keyboard!"

It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
1052,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

Interesting theories presented to the pop culture.The theories here are better formated and oraganized than I attribute to Mann, but it still felt like pulp. This book suffers the fate of some critically acclaimed books---many of the ideas and concepts presented in the book are common place or known about today. Nothing really struck me as original---but I freely admit that may be due to the fact that this book was published 23 years ago. Perhaps if I had read it 23 years ago I might have walked away stunned and overwhelmed with the ideas/concepts in the book? That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas. The peak of this book was in the introduction, wherein he talked about the concerns and pitfalls of a book of this nature. The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts. That we can't assume that one way (the Western culture that seems commonplace today) is better than any other way. You also can't assume that the results are preordained or natural.

1054,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Excellent overview to anthropology study for homo sapiens' cultures. Why the big divides? Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
1055,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."

I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share. When I later attended another college, it was a cultural anthropology professor that became one of the few still remembered teachers. This culture in which we live, too, shall pass."

1061,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species.

I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
1064,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
1066,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."

I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other. About agriculture and the domestication of certain animals, and why each are so vital to a society's success. And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose. Then throw in technology, which, without many exceptions, reads sort of like this: whoever's got the biggest guns (weapons) will win. And all of this with multiple historical examples. Now all or some of this may sound like 'common sense,' like yeah, so what? Isn't all this obvious? Nope, not really, esp. the animals part.

1070,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
1071,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
1072,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."

For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."

I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."

The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

1076,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41267182-tariq-fadel,5,"we usually tend to think of the pharaohs and the Mesopotamian civilizations as belonging to an ancient time in the history of mankind. This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America. That Arabic stems from an African language and that qwerty is not the fastest keyboard!"
1077,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"Its 3.5 stars actually. It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

1080,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054464-john,1,"This was an utter bore. In all honesty, the points of this book could be better learned by playing Sid Meier's Civilization series.Mr. Diamond starts with a question (framed by a question from a New Guinean friend as to why white people are materially richer) and comes up with an answer that can be explained in a page or two. Yet, Mr. Diamond devotes over 400 pages to discussing stuff. The book is extremely repetitive, as he keeps reminding the reader of his conclusions in previous chapters, and runs through crop histories for pages on end. Reading the last chapter is enough to obtain an understanding of Guns, Germs, and Steel.Basically, the world is divided into Eurasia on one end, and the Americas, Africa, and Oceana at the other end. Because Eurasia is so big from east to west without insurmountable barriers, it had more mammals and crops capable of domestication, and had a better way of diffusing crop and animal domestication (and, in turn, technology) to other societies in relative climates. By contrast, the rest of the world didn't, since their north-south narrowness creates too many diverse climates for diffusing crops, or they faced too many geographic barriers. This takes 400 pages of explaining, somehow. Without crops and animals, societies in the other parts of the world didn't have huge population jumps, resistance to diseases from animals, or advanced technology. The end.Mr. Diamond admits that he doesn't explain why only Western Eurasia came to dominate the world instead of the other societies in Eurasia, then he proceeds to an explanation for a few pages (that would've been a more interesting topic). To sum up his final theory, Europe was less integrated, but integrated enough to compete with one another technologically. China was too integrated, and Mesopotamia killed their trees and became a desert. Well, golly."

In case this question immediately makes you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatise, you aren't: as you will see, the answers to the question don't involve human racial differences at all. The book's emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back the chain of historical causation as far as possible.Science writing just doesn't get any better than this. Everyone should read this book. It explains why some societies advanced more rapidly than others and the differences between the victors and the vanquished. I don't know if Professor Diamond came up with all of these brilliant observations, but he gets credit for writing the best book about them. I have given this book to at least a half dozen of my friends and relatives. You're welcome.After reading a couple of one and two star reviews I’ve noticed that they all seem to point towards some sort of racism in this book. These days unless you aren’t calling someone else a racist then obviously you are a racist. Is that about it? A lot of people said the book was boring or poorly written. I didn’t find that to be true, quite the opposite. I’ve read it twice. The ideas put forth in this book were novel to me and make complete sense. If there is a better way to explain the course of history it’s still waiting for me to find it. The critics never post another work we all should be reading. I learned an awful lot about plant and animal domestication and his theory of how geography played such an important part in human development was brilliant. "

It should really be called Germs, Agriculture, and Geographical Positioning. I can see why they went with the later but there is precious little discussion of guns or steel anywhere in the book.That being said, a very interesting read. Here is the essential thesis:“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.""This book is a great answer to the racist notions that european culture ""won"" over other cultures because they were superior, either physically or intellectually. The simple fact is that the different climates led to different germs, crops, and domesticated animals. All of these factors led to how easy a society became ""civilized."" It's as simple as that but a lot of the things Diamond brought up had never occurred to me.This book explains why we don't:- Have Hunting Cheetahs- Eat Lion Burgers- Grow acorns and eat them- Why the new world died from european diseases and not the other way aroundInteresting stuff but not quite the breathtaking game changer it had been built up to be."

This book provides a good antidote for racist or supremacist theories about the differences in development of different societies and a solid base for refutation of heroic narratives that distort history.Germs, for instance, were one of the major weapons that conquerers had, when they collided with native peoples. In some cases, 90% and more of the invaded were killed by a disease brought by the invading army.Jared Diamond writes about the differences the continents had that made plant and animal domestication initiate and develop at very different speeds. And goes on to show the effect that had on the cultures that arose after food production and domestic animals allowed for bigger populations, and more complex societies."

In many ways, what we end up with is an ambitious ""theory"" of world history derived from first-principles.Fair warning, the book is heavy on details about the histories of specific crops and so on which gets a bit dull for the casual reader, but if the premise is at all interesting to you, you will come out the other end feeling a lot less mystified about the large-scale course of world history.PS: See CGP Grey's ""Americapox: The Missing Plague"" video at https://youtu.be/JEYh5WACqEk for a really good summary of the ""germs"" part of this book."

Spanning the period since the beginnings of animal domestication and settled agriculture, it attempts to answer the question as to why particular regions of the globe developed when they did, socio-economically speaking, and why others never developed societies more advanced than hunter-gatherers. Diamond, a professional scientist and amateur historian, adduces a plausible argument based on environmental givens, an hypothesis with a great carrying capacity.This environmentally-deterministic study is counterbalanced by his later work, Collapse, which treats of the matter of the success and failure of human societies. Here social practices, human behaviors, are determinative, but once again in terms of environmental givens.The subtext to both volumes, what I read into them throughout, was an argument against genetic determinism--in other words, against racism.

The answer seems to come down to the ability to produce food through agriculture, which in turn allows for greater population density and faster innovation. Diamond acknowledges the influences of elements like politics, culture, and the Great Man theory, but notes how much less impact these had than environmental factors. Admittedly I lost steam on this one because of the repetition of tracing environmental factors through several regions of the world, but the cases presented were interesting and convincing."

Hence the focus is very narrow and the author remarks about the unanswered questions in the epilogue. The author builds a very convincing case of how Eurasia became quite different from say, the Americas or Africa in terms of technology and immunity to major diseases in 1500 which enabled them to conquer most parts of the world.

1102,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,3,"Guns, Germs, and Steel is basically an answer to the question, ""If Europeans aren't innately superior, why did they end up running everything for so long?"" Or, in the words of a New Guinean given in the beginning of the book:Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?For me, the best metaphor to frame the whole book in is in terms of a game of Civilization. And while I'm sure most anthropologists and ethnologists are even now launching themselves at the screen with their hands reaching for my neck, I'll lay out my case. Civilization IV has a lot of problems as an accurate model of human history and societal interaction (for example, technology as a tree), but it does demonstrate a lot of Diamond's points.For example, locally available resources. In Civilization IV, if you don't have any sulfur, you can't make gunpowder. If you don't have gunpowder, you'll get steamrolled by any civilization who does unless you trade for it--and if you do that, you're at the mercy of the civilization that's providing it for you, and G-d help you if they declare war on you, because you'll lose your ability to make gunpowder units and get stomped.Second, trade. Civilizations that trade technological innovations often advance much faster than a single civilization that tries to turtle up and go Galt (which is my usual strategy...), and it's not unusually to end up behind the tech curve and run into a cavalry vs. tanks situation when expanding out beyond your traditional borders.Third, terrain. Mountains blocking expansion and trade are bad. Starting in the jungle is bad. Lack of natural resources are bad. Small islands are bad. Deserts are bad. All of those make expansion much more difficult and limit your population, which reduces the rate of your technological progress, so you advance slower, have less to trade, and eventually your cavalry gets steamrolled by tanks.There are plenty of points Guns, Germs, and Steel makes that Civilization simply doesn't cover, though, lest you think that playing a video game will provide the same educational experience. For one, disease vectors--a.k.a., why didn't the Europeans get wiped out by super plagues from the Americas? The simple answer is animals. The Eurasian civilizations lived in very close proximity to animals for most of their existence and most of the really serious diseases that affected humans in the past--smallpox, black plague, flu, and so on--were originally animal diseases that made the jump. The cultures in the Americans simply did not have the same range of animals as the Eurasian cultures did, so they had little exposure to animal-borne diseases and hence little resistance to them, and therefore both died in droves and did not inflict a similar fate on Europeans. The popular image of North America as a pristine wilderness is wrong--it wasn't a wilderness, it was a post-apocalyptic wasteland.Though as an interesting note, Diamond points out that when syphillis first appeared, it was a horrific disease that literally caused people's flesh to rot off and killed in months. It mutated shortly after its initially appearance into the insanity-causing, long-term disease we know today, however, and so Europe never experienced The Years of Rice and Salt.(note that whether syphillis actually came from the Americas is still somewhat controversial)Similarly, Civilization doesn't have climate bands, but they were hugely important in world history. Eurasia is oriented east-west, with a similar latitude and climate the whole length, and a contiguous land route to travel along, so it was easy for animals and plants tamed in one place (mostly the Middle East) to spread all along that climactic band to each of those civilizations. In contrast, the Americas are oriented north-south, with desert or mountain barriers in places, and Australia and Oceania have large expanses of water making trade harder and populations smaller in addition to latitude differences. It was difficult to get crops from one place to another, and because it took longer, there was a lower population for a longer time, which reduced the potential for innovation due to a lower possible number of inventors, thus leading to a technological gap which, in combination with the smallpoxalypse, led to the cultural and physical near-extermination of the Native Americans.That part, at least, is familiar to players of Civilization. More food means more people, which means more science and production, which means faster advancement, and it all feeds into each other until you're the ones with tanks stomping everyone else.Okay, enough about Civilization. Anyway, that's Diamond's theory, but there are a few problems with Guns, Germs, and Steel.For one, it is incredibly dry and boring. I often had to force myself to keep reading, and I'd get a few more pages in before I got distracted by something new and interesting. At least twice, I almost fell asleep while I was reading it. There are other reviews mentioning that it took them up to six months to finally finish the entire book, so be warned.Second, there are no footnotes. For a book like this, I'd expect dozens of pages of footnotes meticulously documenting all his assumptions, but that never happens, and it's much to the book's detriment.Third, for a book about why Europeans dominated the world, it's mostly focused on the far past--as Diamond phrases it, on the question I quoted at the beginning of the review. The actual process of domination isn't covered at all except for a brief section about the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas.Finally, and most damningly, the section at the end where Diamond talks about China actually serves to lever open the cracks in his argument. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, China and the Middle East were far more advanced than Europe was, and they also lie in the same Eurasian climactic band that Diamond proposes gave the civilizations within a competitive advantage. So, why is it that neither of them conquered everyone? Diamond has two explanations for this. For China, he claims that China's more continuous government worked against it, because it was possible for the government to ban sea exploration (as actually happened) and have it stick, whereas in Europe when Columbus was trying to finance a sea expedition, he could move from government to government when each successive one turned him down until he found some suckers to finance him.The problem is...this is a cultural explanation. It's saying that China didn't dominate the world because of cultural factors. And if that happened in China, why couldn't it have happened elsewhere. Did the Spanish beat the Aztecs who outnumbered them 100 to 1 because of their geography allowing them to develop superior technology, or was it because the Aztecs exacted ruinous tribute from their client states, causing their subjects to hate them and attach themselves to the first people who looked likely to overthrow their hated rulers? Did the Middle East fail to conquer the world because of increasing desertification and the movement of productive agriculture north and west, as Diamond states, or was it because the Mongols smashed through the states there, burned Baghdad to the ground, and destroyed the system of irrigation canals dating back to the Sumerians, causing a population collapse that Iraq did not recover from until the 20th century? Japan proved that it was perfectly capable of dominating all its neighbors after its modernization during the Meiji Restoration, so clearly it wasn't geography holding it back. Was it the Edo period's 
sakoku
 policy? Because that's another cultural explanation. Diamond spends the entire book talking about geographic and climactic factors being the main reason for the dominance of civilizations, and then chops his argument's legs off in the last 10 pages. The most obvious explanation is that it's a combination of these factors, but that's not what Guns, Germs, and Steel is about. The entire book is an argument for the primacy of geographical factors in determining why the Europeans came to be dominant over the last 500 years, but there are just too many holes and too few citations in the argument for it to be really effective. It's useful to add to the historiography of the European conquest and displacement of most of the rest of the world, but in no way should it be taken as a definitive text."
1103,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.Why is economic development so uneven around the world?Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. “Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?” “[W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents?” “[W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel?” In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a “unified synthesis”—a unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.Academic critics howledHowever, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel: They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. That’s nitpicking, as far as I’m concerned. And many of these “errors” could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories. Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamond’s book, it’s insulting to the reader. The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of “environmental determinism.” Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factors—but he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything we’ve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined. There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didn’t) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamond’s critics never read the book. However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, that’s no error. He didn’t pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.Is it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadn’t cited their own specialized research?The roots of academic criticismThough the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamond’s expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. It’s not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as “not serious.” And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.A wealth of meaning behind the titleTo understand where the academic critics went wrong, it’s useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. “The immediate reasons for Pizarro’s success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.”Diamond’s argument in a nutshellIn a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: “‘Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?'” To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. It’s unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the “civilization” in which we live.Diamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa—and the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United States—impeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the “guns, germs, and steel” that made Eurasian dominance possible—and dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.Guns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesn’t make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, you’ll find this book highly rewarding."
1104,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22548315-zachary-f,4,"In a cultural climate where avowed white supremacists regularly make headlines and elected officials can claim with a straight face that people of color have contributed nothing to world history, Guns, Germs and Steel remains as sadly relevant as it was when first published 20 years ago. Jared Diamond's thesis--that some people groups have historically triumphed over others not because they were made up of innately superior human beings, but rather because of the environmental factors that shaped their societies and fostered technological growth--is so simple and seemingly self-apparent that it’s hard to believe anyone ever had to write a book to prove it. And yet, as the examples above demonstrate, someone did--and a loud western minority (majority?) has still not gotten the message. This book won the Pulitzer and looms large in the pop history genre to this day, so I won’t spend too much time discussing its merits or breaking down its case point by point. Diamond argues persuasively and in great detail that, while humans themselves are pretty much the same everywhere, the environments in which our ancestors had to eke out their livings were not. Some parts of the globe (most notably the huge landmass comprising modern Europe, Asia, and North Africa) yielded an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species, along with the climate necessary to take advantage of these, while other regions did not lend themselves to farming in the same way. Agriculture led to food surpluses and sedentary living, which in turn led to denser populations, increased social and political stratification, and more time and resources for non-essential crafts and trades. With proximity to animals and large, concentrated groups of humans also came more diverse and complex diseases, and eventually immunity or resistance to these diseases. Finally, while the Eurasian landmass is oriented on an east-west axis, meaning that crops, animals, and ideas can spread thousands of miles in a short amount of time with no significant change in climate or environment type, the north-south axes of Africa and the Americas (complete with their own vast deserts and rainforests) make such sharing far more difficult. It’s not that so-called ""primitive"" societies are in any way worse than so-called ""advanced"" ones (Diamond claims that hunter-gatherers are actually better nourished on average than farmers, and they certainly seem no less happy), but they lack the biological, technological, and political advantages that large, sedentary societies possess. When a society armed with guns, horses, and deadly diseases comes against one without, the resulting conquest has nothing to do with the “genetic superiority” of the victors and everything to do with their material assets. Diamond is a biologist by trade, not a historian or an anthropologist, and he is at his best when describing the scientific principles behind the broad sweep of human history. He tends to falter when dealing with more specific details of history and culture, as when he claims that ""Like Arabs and Jews, Koreans and Japanese are peoples joined by blood, yet locked in traditional enmity"" (449). (The notion that Jews and Muslims are natural enemies is a popular one in this day and age, but totally unsupported by history; I suspect the relationship between Korea and Japan is more nuanced than he gives it credit for being, too.) Diamond's style can be dry and a bit repetitive, and he gives New Guinea (his adoptive homeland) what seems like a disproportionate amount of attention. There is also a subtle but unpleasant tinge of social Darwinism in his treatment of imperialism: he never attempts to explain why technologically-advanced peoples always seem to prey on their weaker neighbors, only how they do so--the implication being that such conflicts are inevitable whenever there is a power imbalance and that physical prowess is, in itself, justification for conquest. I don't think Diamond is intentionally advocating for the survival of the fittest (that would be at odds with the whole central thrust of his argument), but in a book whose express purpose is to explain why some peoples have come to dominate others, it seems like a pretty major oversight to neglect the motives of the people in question.Nevertheless, Diamond deserves credit for such a comprehensive and lucid treatment of an enormous and multifaceted topic. His arguments are rigorous, he treats his subjects with an even hand and fitting respect, and it's clear that his goal is to empower the oppressed rather than to glorify their oppressors. Recommended to anyone interested in why the world is how it is and unsatisfied with the reductive, self-serving rhetoric of our time and place."
1105,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232965-zain-hashmy,4,"Guns, Germs and Steel deserves two reviews, because writing one cannot do it justice. The first part of my review will be objective, and will concern general readers. The second part of my review will be personal and will deal with how I felt while reading this book. I'm writing this review now, with the details fresh in my mind, having finished the book only moments ago.Guns, Germs and Steel attempts to answer a complex geopolitical question ; Why have the Europeans emerged as the dominant power in the world, while many other native populations died out? Classically, the answer to this question is racist. In this book, Jared Diamond has explained through careful examination and observation why that racist answer should be consigned to oblivion. The question is addressed over 19 chapters, each of them covering as much ground as possible, to give a broad perspective and scope, with scientific studies and research to back up every claim. The argument stands tall on the basis of good science, spruced-up logic and well grounded theories. The average reader will delight in the simplicity of the book, and how the concepts are explained in great detail without excessive jargon. Jared goes over the rise and fall of civilizations, the modern day players, the development of technologies, and every anthropological factor that might possibly hold a clue. He treats this question as a giant puzzle, and gently assembles the pieces together to make the outline of a picture. Moreover, he himself admits that this is merely the outline of the picture, and the gaps need to be filled in by other writers, and more knowledge. That makes the book endearing, because the author understands the scope of the project, and acknowledges his own limitations. The writing style is somewhat verbose, and would benefit from some hack-n-slash editing, but overall, it remains an excellent book for most readers. Part 2.Unfortunately, I'm not one of those readers. Time to rant a bit. WHYY is the book so slow? I understand that he's trying to not be racist, but treading on eggshells all the way through the book, giving multiple explanations and scenarios to justify the same theory becomes taxing. Frustratingly enough, I understand the need to do that. It took one book, Madison's 'Passing of the Races', to inspire a man like Hitler into committing genocide, so this is probably a topic to tread carefully around. That doesn't make the argument style ANY less annoying. The explanations are drawn out and EVERY single detail is highlighted. With a background in Biotechnology and a strong interest in related sciences, I find his overexplanation of the subject terribly draining in many places. Furthermore, there are a few flaws in the argument, which I will discuss once a few other people have finished reading the book, and I've had a solid discussion with them. In simple terms, a normal scientific book will usually explain a concept at the start of the book, and for the rest of the book, will assume that you know the concept, so as to not double back on explanations. Not Mr. Diamond, noooo. I agree that this book should be made mandatory for anyone with a racist temperament, and their intelligence likely requires the repeated explanations but most people don't. I would happily recommend this book to an average person, but I would think ten times before recommending it to any of my friends because they are likely to get bored and abandon it halfway.More discussion on the flaws in theory is yet to come."
1106,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,3,"Why did Europe succeed?27 December 2012	This is one of those books that tries to ask the question of why the European civilisation managed to succeed where all other world civilisations failed. His conclusions are interesting, however we must remember that even now, fifteen years after this book was completed we are seeing an economic collapse in the west against an economic resurgence in China, India, and Brazil.	One of the ideas that he had was due to the axis of the continents. The only continent on a horizontal axis is the Eurasian mega-continent, which means that the entire continent is located in the temperate zone. However I find that idea to be a little dubious. Okay, granted, major civilisations arose across the continent: Europe, Arabia, India, and China; and trade existed among these four civilisations, however it does not really account for the rise of Europe to the exclusion of the rest.	One interesting idea I would suggest is to do with the Mongol hordes that smashed across Asia and the Middle East. In a way the Middle East never recovered from those invasions, and China was knocked back hundreds of years. Europe, by pure chance, managed to be spared, which meant that they were able to continue to develop ahead of the other Eurasian powers. This also resulted in them developing shipping which enabled them to take control of the Arabian Sea from the Arabs (since the land routes had been subsequently blocked by the Mongols).	The idea of trade along a horizontal axis is interesting, and we note that there was not much trade between the civilisations of America. Even then simple trade is unlikely to be hindered by tropical conditions. One thing about the American tribes is that they never developed shipping, which would have been something that prevented them from trading over long distances. In Africa we don't see much in the way of trade either, and the closer you get to the equator, the less developed the nations you encounter.	The concept of germs is interesting in that disease is a barrier to development. With malaria in the tropics it makes development of civilisation there difficult at best, and this can also prove a hindrance to trade, and Malaria is a disease that does not thrive well in colder climates. We also note that the common cold wrecked havoc in the Americas, where as the only disease we inherited from the New World was chlamydia, which is a sexually transmitted disease (the common cold is airbourne). However, that does not mean that Europe had been spared its devastating diseases, as the black plague ran rampant for over five hundred years and accounted for the death of up to a third of the population at its height.	Guns and steel deal more with technological development. The Eurasian civilisations had steel and guns were imported from China, but some suggest that the Chinese never used gunpower for weapons. That is rubbish. The Chinese had developed and were using explosives and rockets in warfare, but that did not save them from the Mongol Hordes. Even then, guns were a pretty poor weapon up until the eighteenth century, and were still quite inadequate. It wasn't until the 20th century that their truly devastating power comes into play.	The the balkanised nature of the European states also has a part to play. There is a point in that because there are all these competing countries all trying to gain an advantage over the other, which results in a perpetual arms race. That did not happen in China because the Chinese government pretty much controlled the entire region. However, that does not account for the fact that such balkanisation existed in the Americas and Africa. This also existed to an extent in the Middle East and India, but both of these regions, for a long time, have been under the dominant power of a single empire (the Ottomans in the Middle East and the Mogols, and later the British, in India). 	To me, the only real answer to this is that not only was Europe spared the ravaging of the Mongol hordes, but that we Europeans are in reality a sadistic and savage lot who are always looking for faster and more sophisticated ways of killing each other. It is not that the Native Americans lived in peace, they didn't, it was just that they were satisfied with using basic weapons. Even when they did have access to guns, they took them and then turned them on each other."
1107,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"The title “Guns, Germs and Steel” invokes in one’s mind the image of clacking metals and blazing guns. Then you suddenly realize you forgot about the germs part because you had no idea how to work gooey pathogens into such an awesome visual. In retrospect, however, you feel like Germs should have been the focal point of this title. Upon further musings, you reject that notion too and want to settle for something more mundane like “A brief history of post-Pleistocene humanity”. Maybe a more riveting title would have driven sales in the upward direction, but the central question that this book sets out to answer is no cakewalk: “Why did history take such divergent trajectories in the different continents?” Why indeed?Different variants of the same question have been posed for quite some time: “Why did Africa fail to launch a single civilization in the past 10,000 years or so?” “Of all the landmasses in the world, why did Eurasia enjoy a such massive headstart in creating giant empires, like the Roman empire in Italy or the Shang Dynasty in China?” “Why did Australian aborigines fail to move beyond the stone age on a timescale of thousands of years whereas the Europeans succeeded in creating and sustaining a modern nation state within two centuries of landing on the western coast of the continent?”Many answers have been proposed and depending on your worldview, you may prefer one over several others. In the pre-Renaissance era, the view of most people pondering over such matters can be summarized in a simple sentence: “They are filthy savages, we are civilized humans. That’s it” With the advent of biological evolution, efforts were made to recast the answer in more scientific terms: “Just as the Cro-Magnons were an evolutionary upgrade on the Neanderthals, so are we (Europeans/ Caucasians) a more advanced form of humans vis-à-vis the blacks/aborigines/Indians.” In retrospect, it might sound hilarious, but at that time, serious research works were carried out to show that Africans have a more primitive skull structure akin to the Chimpanzees. And then came Mendel with genetics and it did not take much time for people to weaponize that concept either. The Nazis believed they were a genetically superior race and actively carried out eugenics to optimize favorable hereditary characteristics among their people, despite zero science to back up such a genocidal social policy. To this day, the genetic superiority theory has no shortage of preachers and evangelists. The likes of Sam Harris and Jordan Petersen are going around the globe and brandishing psychologist Charles Murray’s Race-and-Intelligence Bell Curve. The implication is pretty straightforward, “Look mate, even if slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the likes did not happen, the African Americans would still be hard-pressed to climb up the social ladder since they are genetically indisposed to do so. Sad!!” The appropriation of scientific concepts by intellectuals of the social science disciplines to justify confounding claims is nothing new. And as I have already stated, each individual would be amenable to a different answer to this question depending on how he/she perceives the world-at-large. So, in the marketplace of ideas, who should we subscribe to? In other words, which discipline or branch of science is best-suited to answer this question? And the answer is: Anthropology. Wild as it may seem at first, you would think the responsibility to answer a question regarding humans should befell the people whose job is to literally study humans.And this is where this book shines brightly. Jared Diamond does a fantastic job of breaking down the geographical, agricultural, political and social forces that propelled different people to very disparate directions. But most importantly, this book stands as a solid buttress to human capital. Given the right tools and right conditions of existence, anyone possesses the mental faculty to do anything they would want to do. No one is genetically incapacitated to be an engineer or a physicist. But if you choose to believe otherwise, that is your prerogative. Just read the book and see if it can challenge, if not alter radically, your worldview. "
1108,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145461-rindis,3,"To a certain extent, I've always wondered why Guns, Germs, and Steel caused such a huge splash. The main premise boils down to 'differences in geography cause differences in societies and their history', which belongs to the club of the blindingly obvious.Of course, the real point of the book is to pin down just which differences are the important ones. This is a cause for much arguement, but Diamond has successfully pulled out the most important ones as applied to history as a whole. This largely turns into a study of what plants and animals were successfully domesticated in early prehistory, and how that turned certain areas into the origin of settled agriculture. That is still fairly basic stuff, but benefits greatly from studying the results from all around the world all at once, and examining just what it takes for something to be capable of being domesticated. (I know there's been some interesting work done on that since this book came out, but I haven't seen it escape scholarly journals in more detail than a National Geographic article.)From there, Diamond points out how plants and animals are generally adapted to a certain climate, and that while it is fairly easy to find different climates going east and west (due to cold mountains, dry deserts, wet coasts, and other accidents of geology), large differences of climate are guaranteed when traveling any real distance north and south. Looking at a map and noting that the Americas and Africa are divided into north-south zones, while Eurasia is oriented east-west, then provides material to show why certain areas needed to work everything out independently, while others were able to borrow everything they needed from elsewhere (before the Age of Exploration, the two situations were probably somewhat even by landmass; the book naturally spends much more time looking at the former).The main thing that makes this book new is actually the 'germs' part of the book. It is only fairly recently that we've really become aware of where most of the deadly diseases we have to deal with come from—other animals. So societies that have and live closely with lots of domesticatible animals get to suffer from deadly epidemics when an occasional virus adapts to a new host (us), and then develop some level of immunity to it. When people who don't have much/anything in the way of domesticated animals run into people who do, they die off as multiple epidemics run through the countryside. This is the other 'new' part—the fact that a lot of Native American population was wiped out by disease is well known, but it's been hard to realize the scale of the disaster. The ""Mound Builders"" were a disappeared pre-Columbian civilization of the Mississippi valley, and only recently has it been realized it was actually wiped out by European diseases before any Europeans got there to see it.The 'guns' and 'steel' parts of the book are essentially non-existent. They just serve as part of the proximate cause of how Europeans came to dominate the world before turning to look for the ultimate causes back in prehistory. This is where his biases as a biologist who's picked up a fair amount of practical cultural anthropology show. While he does discuss technology, and the fact that the wider the range of where you can get ideas from, the more ideas you will be able to encounter, he doesn't spend any time looking at the basics of physical technology. A basic study of easily available copper, tin, iron, and clay deposits, compared with the areas that were able to develop settled agriculture could explain much that remains mysterious to him.It's decidedly a layman's book, and has the advantage of being aware of more current research than any pre-college textbook. The fairly breezy, non-technical writing is set off by a good number of informative charts and maps and allow him to make his points without miring himself in the minutia that would lose the non-dedicated reader. Just being able to tackle most of pre-history in a single reasonably-sized volume is an impressive feat of summarization, and the most impressive thing about the book."

Abdullah Ocalan seems to have done a better job writing with the extremely limited resources allowed him by his jailers than authors like Francis Fukuyama or Jared Diamond did with access to the world's finest research libraries."" — David GraeberThe conditions of which David Graeber speaks are that of being locked up in solitary confinement with 24 hour/day artificial light illuminating his cell. Allowed to have one book at a time, and oftimes no writing instruments. And the book(s) he wrote were communicated to the public via live speach, or in first draft form written hastily as part of his testimony for his trials.So, is Jared Diamond's book that bad that a guy who's locked up in such brutal conditions can do better? Well, not really. It is almost certain that Jared Diamond reveals important factors that went into the emergence and differentiation of variagrated civilization, it's just that his analysis is definitely incomplete by simple virtue of being more materialistic than that of any hardline marxist. There is very few, and ultimately unconvincing, arguments about the formation of institutions, the emergence of cities, and ultimately of nation-states. And almost no mention of any social movement of any kind.True to the title, the red thread woven through the entire analysis of civilization is done by looking at why certain societies had developed guns, germs, and steel the way they have. It presents rather novel ideas for the layperson not versed in the subject. A quick, and woefully incomplete, enumeration being:1) Euroasia had a geographical advantage because it had more indigenous crops that could potentially be domesticated2) The domestication of said plants could spread from the Fertile Crescent where they first emerged more easily because of relatively uniform climate along the longer axis (east-west) of Eurasia. The Americas suffering from the fact that their longest geographical distance was from north-south, thus cross-cutting through extremely different climates3) Eurasia also had more potential animals for domestication (also goes into why some species are better suited than others), thus Eurasians had a very decisive advantage in terms of the diseases that they developed resistance too, since most ones are of animal origin And so on. You get the picture, right? Fairly solid arguments, and worth carefully studying because they can almost immediately shut up racists, euro-centrists, and so on. But do not think that by reading this book you have garnered enough information about early human history to call it quits. It might be enough to show off at certain parties, but in order to actually synthesise new ways forward there's a long list of problems, not even touched upon, by Jared Diamond."
1110,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054464-john,1,"This was an utter bore. In all honesty, the points of this book could be better learned by playing Sid Meier's Civilization series.Mr. Diamond starts with a question (framed by a question from a New Guinean friend as to why white people are materially richer) and comes up with an answer that can be explained in a page or two. Yet, Mr. Diamond devotes over 400 pages to discussing stuff. The book is extremely repetitive, as he keeps reminding the reader of his conclusions in previous chapters, and runs through crop histories for pages on end. Reading the last chapter is enough to obtain an understanding of Guns, Germs, and Steel.Basically, the world is divided into Eurasia on one end, and the Americas, Africa, and Oceana at the other end. Because Eurasia is so big from east to west without insurmountable barriers, it had more mammals and crops capable of domestication, and had a better way of diffusing crop and animal domestication (and, in turn, technology) to other societies in relative climates. By contrast, the rest of the world didn't, since their north-south narrowness creates too many diverse climates for diffusing crops, or they faced too many geographic barriers. This takes 400 pages of explaining, somehow. Without crops and animals, societies in the other parts of the world didn't have huge population jumps, resistance to diseases from animals, or advanced technology. The end.Mr. Diamond admits that he doesn't explain why only Western Eurasia came to dominate the world instead of the other societies in Eurasia, then he proceeds to an explanation for a few pages (that would've been a more interesting topic). To sum up his final theory, Europe was less integrated, but integrated enough to compete with one another technologically. China was too integrated, and Mesopotamia killed their trees and became a desert. Well, golly."

In case this question immediately makes you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatise, you aren't: as you will see, the answers to the question don't involve human racial differences at all. The book's emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back the chain of historical causation as far as possible.Science writing just doesn't get any better than this. Everyone should read this book. It explains why some societies advanced more rapidly than others and the differences between the victors and the vanquished. I don't know if Professor Diamond came up with all of these brilliant observations, but he gets credit for writing the best book about them. I have given this book to at least a half dozen of my friends and relatives. You're welcome.After reading a couple of one and two star reviews I’ve noticed that they all seem to point towards some sort of racism in this book. These days unless you aren’t calling someone else a racist then obviously you are a racist. Is that about it? A lot of people said the book was boring or poorly written. I didn’t find that to be true, quite the opposite. I’ve read it twice. The ideas put forth in this book were novel to me and make complete sense. If there is a better way to explain the course of history it’s still waiting for me to find it. The critics never post another work we all should be reading. I learned an awful lot about plant and animal domestication and his theory of how geography played such an important part in human development was brilliant. "

It should really be called Germs, Agriculture, and Geographical Positioning. I can see why they went with the later but there is precious little discussion of guns or steel anywhere in the book.That being said, a very interesting read. Here is the essential thesis:“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.""This book is a great answer to the racist notions that european culture ""won"" over other cultures because they were superior, either physically or intellectually. The simple fact is that the different climates led to different germs, crops, and domesticated animals. All of these factors led to how easy a society became ""civilized."" It's as simple as that but a lot of the things Diamond brought up had never occurred to me.This book explains why we don't:- Have Hunting Cheetahs- Eat Lion Burgers- Grow acorns and eat them- Why the new world died from european diseases and not the other way aroundInteresting stuff but not quite the breathtaking game changer it had been built up to be."

This book provides a good antidote for racist or supremacist theories about the differences in development of different societies and a solid base for refutation of heroic narratives that distort history.Germs, for instance, were one of the major weapons that conquerers had, when they collided with native peoples. In some cases, 90% and more of the invaded were killed by a disease brought by the invading army.Jared Diamond writes about the differences the continents had that made plant and animal domestication initiate and develop at very different speeds. And goes on to show the effect that had on the cultures that arose after food production and domestic animals allowed for bigger populations, and more complex societies."

In many ways, what we end up with is an ambitious ""theory"" of world history derived from first-principles.Fair warning, the book is heavy on details about the histories of specific crops and so on which gets a bit dull for the casual reader, but if the premise is at all interesting to you, you will come out the other end feeling a lot less mystified about the large-scale course of world history.PS: See CGP Grey's ""Americapox: The Missing Plague"" video at https://youtu.be/JEYh5WACqEk for a really good summary of the ""germs"" part of this book."

Spanning the period since the beginnings of animal domestication and settled agriculture, it attempts to answer the question as to why particular regions of the globe developed when they did, socio-economically speaking, and why others never developed societies more advanced than hunter-gatherers. Diamond, a professional scientist and amateur historian, adduces a plausible argument based on environmental givens, an hypothesis with a great carrying capacity.This environmentally-deterministic study is counterbalanced by his later work, Collapse, which treats of the matter of the success and failure of human societies. Here social practices, human behaviors, are determinative, but once again in terms of environmental givens.The subtext to both volumes, what I read into them throughout, was an argument against genetic determinism--in other words, against racism.

The answer seems to come down to the ability to produce food through agriculture, which in turn allows for greater population density and faster innovation.

Forget Isaac Newton, Mozart, Da Vinci and others. They belonged to societies that perpetrated war. This in a nutshell is the premise of this much lauded book. Really? Seriously? What about wars for independence, freedom from tyrants, or even communism? Was World War II frivolous and unnecessary? I doubt the aboriginals would think so under Hitler's regime.

Hence the focus is very narrow and the author remarks about the unanswered questions in the epilogue. The author builds a very convincing case of how Eurasia became quite different from say, the Americas or Africa in terms of technology and immunity to major diseases in 1500 which enabled them to conquer most parts of the world. But the book doesn't not go into the differences within Eurasia. Hence it is. though very detailed, a good starting point for further readings on human history and the fates of various civilisations.."

For example, it says if you think that Africans, Native Americans, and Asians/Australo-asians were inferior when Europeans arrived, think again. It was the environment (namely the lack of 'guns, germs and steel´ and why they didn't have those things) that determined their 'development'. Educational to say the least.

1132,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,3,"Guns, Germs, and Steel is basically an answer to the question, ""If Europeans aren't innately superior, why did they end up running everything for so long?"" Or, in the words of a New Guinean given in the beginning of the book:Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?For me, the best metaphor to frame the whole book in is in terms of a game of Civilization. And while I'm sure most anthropologists and ethnologists are even now launching themselves at the screen with their hands reaching for my neck, I'll lay out my case. Civilization IV has a lot of problems as an accurate model of human history and societal interaction (for example, technology as a tree), but it does demonstrate a lot of Diamond's points.For example, locally available resources. In Civilization IV, if you don't have any sulfur, you can't make gunpowder. If you don't have gunpowder, you'll get steamrolled by any civilization who does unless you trade for it--and if you do that, you're at the mercy of the civilization that's providing it for you, and G-d help you if they declare war on you, because you'll lose your ability to make gunpowder units and get stomped.Second, trade. Civilizations that trade technological innovations often advance much faster than a single civilization that tries to turtle up and go Galt (which is my usual strategy...), and it's not unusually to end up behind the tech curve and run into a cavalry vs. tanks situation when expanding out beyond your traditional borders.Third, terrain. Mountains blocking expansion and trade are bad. Starting in the jungle is bad. Lack of natural resources are bad. Small islands are bad. Deserts are bad. All of those make expansion much more difficult and limit your population, which reduces the rate of your technological progress, so you advance slower, have less to trade, and eventually your cavalry gets steamrolled by tanks.There are plenty of points Guns, Germs, and Steel makes that Civilization simply doesn't cover, though, lest you think that playing a video game will provide the same educational experience. For one, disease vectors--a.k.a., why didn't the Europeans get wiped out by super plagues from the Americas? The simple answer is animals. The Eurasian civilizations lived in very close proximity to animals for most of their existence and most of the really serious diseases that affected humans in the past--smallpox, black plague, flu, and so on--were originally animal diseases that made the jump. The cultures in the Americans simply did not have the same range of animals as the Eurasian cultures did, so they had little exposure to animal-borne diseases and hence little resistance to them, and therefore both died in droves and did not inflict a similar fate on Europeans. The popular image of North America as a pristine wilderness is wrong--it wasn't a wilderness, it was a post-apocalyptic wasteland.Though as an interesting note, Diamond points out that when syphillis first appeared, it was a horrific disease that literally caused people's flesh to rot off and killed in months. It mutated shortly after its initially appearance into the insanity-causing, long-term disease we know today, however, and so Europe never experienced The Years of Rice and Salt.(note that whether syphillis actually came from the Americas is still somewhat controversial)Similarly, Civilization doesn't have climate bands, but they were hugely important in world history. Eurasia is oriented east-west, with a similar latitude and climate the whole length, and a contiguous land route to travel along, so it was easy for animals and plants tamed in one place (mostly the Middle East) to spread all along that climactic band to each of those civilizations. In contrast, the Americas are oriented north-south, with desert or mountain barriers in places, and Australia and Oceania have large expanses of water making trade harder and populations smaller in addition to latitude differences. It was difficult to get crops from one place to another, and because it took longer, there was a lower population for a longer time, which reduced the potential for innovation due to a lower possible number of inventors, thus leading to a technological gap which, in combination with the smallpoxalypse, led to the cultural and physical near-extermination of the Native Americans.That part, at least, is familiar to players of Civilization. More food means more people, which means more science and production, which means faster advancement, and it all feeds into each other until you're the ones with tanks stomping everyone else.Okay, enough about Civilization. Anyway, that's Diamond's theory, but there are a few problems with Guns, Germs, and Steel.For one, it is incredibly dry and boring. I often had to force myself to keep reading, and I'd get a few more pages in before I got distracted by something new and interesting. At least twice, I almost fell asleep while I was reading it. There are other reviews mentioning that it took them up to six months to finally finish the entire book, so be warned.Second, there are no footnotes. For a book like this, I'd expect dozens of pages of footnotes meticulously documenting all his assumptions, but that never happens, and it's much to the book's detriment.Third, for a book about why Europeans dominated the world, it's mostly focused on the far past--as Diamond phrases it, on the question I quoted at the beginning of the review. The actual process of domination isn't covered at all except for a brief section about the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas.Finally, and most damningly, the section at the end where Diamond talks about China actually serves to lever open the cracks in his argument. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, China and the Middle East were far more advanced than Europe was, and they also lie in the same Eurasian climactic band that Diamond proposes gave the civilizations within a competitive advantage. So, why is it that neither of them conquered everyone? Diamond has two explanations for this. For China, he claims that China's more continuous government worked against it, because it was possible for the government to ban sea exploration (as actually happened) and have it stick, whereas in Europe when Columbus was trying to finance a sea expedition, he could move from government to government when each successive one turned him down until he found some suckers to finance him.The problem is...this is a cultural explanation. It's saying that China didn't dominate the world because of cultural factors. And if that happened in China, why couldn't it have happened elsewhere. Did the Spanish beat the Aztecs who outnumbered them 100 to 1 because of their geography allowing them to develop superior technology, or was it because the Aztecs exacted ruinous tribute from their client states, causing their subjects to hate them and attach themselves to the first people who looked likely to overthrow their hated rulers? Did the Middle East fail to conquer the world because of increasing desertification and the movement of productive agriculture north and west, as Diamond states, or was it because the Mongols smashed through the states there, burned Baghdad to the ground, and destroyed the system of irrigation canals dating back to the Sumerians, causing a population collapse that Iraq did not recover from until the 20th century? Japan proved that it was perfectly capable of dominating all its neighbors after its modernization during the Meiji Restoration, so clearly it wasn't geography holding it back. Was it the Edo period's 
sakoku
 policy? Because that's another cultural explanation. Diamond spends the entire book talking about geographic and climactic factors being the main reason for the dominance of civilizations, and then chops his argument's legs off in the last 10 pages. The most obvious explanation is that it's a combination of these factors, but that's not what Guns, Germs, and Steel is about. The entire book is an argument for the primacy of geographical factors in determining why the Europeans came to be dominant over the last 500 years, but there are just too many holes and too few citations in the argument for it to be really effective. It's useful to add to the historiography of the European conquest and displacement of most of the rest of the world, but in no way should it be taken as a definitive text."
1133,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.Why is economic development so uneven around the world?Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. “Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?” “[W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents?” “[W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel?” In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a “unified synthesis”—a unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.Academic critics howledHowever, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel: They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. That’s nitpicking, as far as I’m concerned. And many of these “errors” could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories. Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamond’s book, it’s insulting to the reader. The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of “environmental determinism.” Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factors—but he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything we’ve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined. There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didn’t) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamond’s critics never read the book. However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, that’s no error. He didn’t pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.Is it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadn’t cited their own specialized research?The roots of academic criticismThough the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamond’s expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. It’s not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as “not serious.” And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.A wealth of meaning behind the titleTo understand where the academic critics went wrong, it’s useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. “The immediate reasons for Pizarro’s success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.”Diamond’s argument in a nutshellIn a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: “‘Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?'” To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. It’s unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the “civilization” in which we live.Diamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa—and the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United States—impeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the “guns, germs, and steel” that made Eurasian dominance possible—and dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.Guns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesn’t make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, you’ll find this book highly rewarding."
1134,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22548315-zachary-f,4,"In a cultural climate where avowed white supremacists regularly make headlines and elected officials can claim with a straight face that people of color have contributed nothing to world history, Guns, Germs and Steel remains as sadly relevant as it was when first published 20 years ago. Jared Diamond's thesis--that some people groups have historically triumphed over others not because they were made up of innately superior human beings, but rather because of the environmental factors that shaped their societies and fostered technological growth--is so simple and seemingly self-apparent that it’s hard to believe anyone ever had to write a book to prove it. And yet, as the examples above demonstrate, someone did--and a loud western minority (majority?) has still not gotten the message. This book won the Pulitzer and looms large in the pop history genre to this day, so I won’t spend too much time discussing its merits or breaking down its case point by point. Diamond argues persuasively and in great detail that, while humans themselves are pretty much the same everywhere, the environments in which our ancestors had to eke out their livings were not. Some parts of the globe (most notably the huge landmass comprising modern Europe, Asia, and North Africa) yielded an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species, along with the climate necessary to take advantage of these, while other regions did not lend themselves to farming in the same way. Agriculture led to food surpluses and sedentary living, which in turn led to denser populations, increased social and political stratification, and more time and resources for non-essential crafts and trades. With proximity to animals and large, concentrated groups of humans also came more diverse and complex diseases, and eventually immunity or resistance to these diseases. Finally, while the Eurasian landmass is oriented on an east-west axis, meaning that crops, animals, and ideas can spread thousands of miles in a short amount of time with no significant change in climate or environment type, the north-south axes of Africa and the Americas (complete with their own vast deserts and rainforests) make such sharing far more difficult. It’s not that so-called ""primitive"" societies are in any way worse than so-called ""advanced"" ones (Diamond claims that hunter-gatherers are actually better nourished on average than farmers, and they certainly seem no less happy), but they lack the biological, technological, and political advantages that large, sedentary societies possess. When a society armed with guns, horses, and deadly diseases comes against one without, the resulting conquest has nothing to do with the “genetic superiority” of the victors and everything to do with their material assets. Diamond is a biologist by trade, not a historian or an anthropologist, and he is at his best when describing the scientific principles behind the broad sweep of human history. He tends to falter when dealing with more specific details of history and culture, as when he claims that ""Like Arabs and Jews, Koreans and Japanese are peoples joined by blood, yet locked in traditional enmity"" (449). (The notion that Jews and Muslims are natural enemies is a popular one in this day and age, but totally unsupported by history; I suspect the relationship between Korea and Japan is more nuanced than he gives it credit for being, too.) Diamond's style can be dry and a bit repetitive, and he gives New Guinea (his adoptive homeland) what seems like a disproportionate amount of attention. There is also a subtle but unpleasant tinge of social Darwinism in his treatment of imperialism: he never attempts to explain why technologically-advanced peoples always seem to prey on their weaker neighbors, only how they do so--the implication being that such conflicts are inevitable whenever there is a power imbalance and that physical prowess is, in itself, justification for conquest. I don't think Diamond is intentionally advocating for the survival of the fittest (that would be at odds with the whole central thrust of his argument), but in a book whose express purpose is to explain why some peoples have come to dominate others, it seems like a pretty major oversight to neglect the motives of the people in question.Nevertheless, Diamond deserves credit for such a comprehensive and lucid treatment of an enormous and multifaceted topic. His arguments are rigorous, he treats his subjects with an even hand and fitting respect, and it's clear that his goal is to empower the oppressed rather than to glorify their oppressors. Recommended to anyone interested in why the world is how it is and unsatisfied with the reductive, self-serving rhetoric of our time and place."
1135,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232965-zain-hashmy,4,"Guns, Germs and Steel deserves two reviews, because writing one cannot do it justice. The first part of my review will be objective, and will concern general readers. The second part of my review will be personal and will deal with how I felt while reading this book. I'm writing this review now, with the details fresh in my mind, having finished the book only moments ago.Guns, Germs and Steel attempts to answer a complex geopolitical question ; Why have the Europeans emerged as the dominant power in the world, while many other native populations died out? Classically, the answer to this question is racist. In this book, Jared Diamond has explained through careful examination and observation why that racist answer should be consigned to oblivion. The question is addressed over 19 chapters, each of them covering as much ground as possible, to give a broad perspective and scope, with scientific studies and research to back up every claim. The argument stands tall on the basis of good science, spruced-up logic and well grounded theories. The average reader will delight in the simplicity of the book, and how the concepts are explained in great detail without excessive jargon. Jared goes over the rise and fall of civilizations, the modern day players, the development of technologies, and every anthropological factor that might possibly hold a clue. He treats this question as a giant puzzle, and gently assembles the pieces together to make the outline of a picture. Moreover, he himself admits that this is merely the outline of the picture, and the gaps need to be filled in by other writers, and more knowledge. That makes the book endearing, because the author understands the scope of the project, and acknowledges his own limitations. The writing style is somewhat verbose, and would benefit from some hack-n-slash editing, but overall, it remains an excellent book for most readers. Part 2.Unfortunately, I'm not one of those readers. Time to rant a bit. WHYY is the book so slow? I understand that he's trying to not be racist, but treading on eggshells all the way through the book, giving multiple explanations and scenarios to justify the same theory becomes taxing. Frustratingly enough, I understand the need to do that. It took one book, Madison's 'Passing of the Races', to inspire a man like Hitler into committing genocide, so this is probably a topic to tread carefully around. That doesn't make the argument style ANY less annoying. The explanations are drawn out and EVERY single detail is highlighted. With a background in Biotechnology and a strong interest in related sciences, I find his overexplanation of the subject terribly draining in many places. Furthermore, there are a few flaws in the argument, which I will discuss once a few other people have finished reading the book, and I've had a solid discussion with them. In simple terms, a normal scientific book will usually explain a concept at the start of the book, and for the rest of the book, will assume that you know the concept, so as to not double back on explanations. Not Mr. Diamond, noooo. I agree that this book should be made mandatory for anyone with a racist temperament, and their intelligence likely requires the repeated explanations but most people don't. I would happily recommend this book to an average person, but I would think ten times before recommending it to any of my friends because they are likely to get bored and abandon it halfway.More discussion on the flaws in theory is yet to come."
1136,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,3,"Why did Europe succeed?27 December 2012	This is one of those books that tries to ask the question of why the European civilisation managed to succeed where all other world civilisations failed. His conclusions are interesting, however we must remember that even now, fifteen years after this book was completed we are seeing an economic collapse in the west against an economic resurgence in China, India, and Brazil.	One of the ideas that he had was due to the axis of the continents. The only continent on a horizontal axis is the Eurasian mega-continent, which means that the entire continent is located in the temperate zone. However I find that idea to be a little dubious. Okay, granted, major civilisations arose across the continent: Europe, Arabia, India, and China; and trade existed among these four civilisations, however it does not really account for the rise of Europe to the exclusion of the rest.	One interesting idea I would suggest is to do with the Mongol hordes that smashed across Asia and the Middle East. In a way the Middle East never recovered from those invasions, and China was knocked back hundreds of years. Europe, by pure chance, managed to be spared, which meant that they were able to continue to develop ahead of the other Eurasian powers. This also resulted in them developing shipping which enabled them to take control of the Arabian Sea from the Arabs (since the land routes had been subsequently blocked by the Mongols).	The idea of trade along a horizontal axis is interesting, and we note that there was not much trade between the civilisations of America. Even then simple trade is unlikely to be hindered by tropical conditions. One thing about the American tribes is that they never developed shipping, which would have been something that prevented them from trading over long distances. In Africa we don't see much in the way of trade either, and the closer you get to the equator, the less developed the nations you encounter.	The concept of germs is interesting in that disease is a barrier to development. With malaria in the tropics it makes development of civilisation there difficult at best, and this can also prove a hindrance to trade, and Malaria is a disease that does not thrive well in colder climates. We also note that the common cold wrecked havoc in the Americas, where as the only disease we inherited from the New World was chlamydia, which is a sexually transmitted disease (the common cold is airbourne). However, that does not mean that Europe had been spared its devastating diseases, as the black plague ran rampant for over five hundred years and accounted for the death of up to a third of the population at its height.	Guns and steel deal more with technological development. The Eurasian civilisations had steel and guns were imported from China, but some suggest that the Chinese never used gunpower for weapons. That is rubbish. The Chinese had developed and were using explosives and rockets in warfare, but that did not save them from the Mongol Hordes. Even then, guns were a pretty poor weapon up until the eighteenth century, and were still quite inadequate. It wasn't until the 20th century that their truly devastating power comes into play.	The the balkanised nature of the European states also has a part to play. There is a point in that because there are all these competing countries all trying to gain an advantage over the other, which results in a perpetual arms race. That did not happen in China because the Chinese government pretty much controlled the entire region. However, that does not account for the fact that such balkanisation existed in the Americas and Africa. This also existed to an extent in the Middle East and India, but both of these regions, for a long time, have been under the dominant power of a single empire (the Ottomans in the Middle East and the Mogols, and later the British, in India). 	To me, the only real answer to this is that not only was Europe spared the ravaging of the Mongol hordes, but that we Europeans are in reality a sadistic and savage lot who are always looking for faster and more sophisticated ways of killing each other. It is not that the Native Americans lived in peace, they didn't, it was just that they were satisfied with using basic weapons. Even when they did have access to guns, they took them and then turned them on each other."
1137,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"The title “Guns, Germs and Steel” invokes in one’s mind the image of clacking metals and blazing guns. Then you suddenly realize you forgot about the germs part because you had no idea how to work gooey pathogens into such an awesome visual. In retrospect, however, you feel like Germs should have been the focal point of this title. Upon further musings, you reject that notion too and want to settle for something more mundane like “A brief history of post-Pleistocene humanity”. Maybe a more riveting title would have driven sales in the upward direction, but the central question that this book sets out to answer is no cakewalk: “Why did history take such divergent trajectories in the different continents?” Why indeed?Different variants of the same question have been posed for quite some time: “Why did Africa fail to launch a single civilization in the past 10,000 years or so?” “Of all the landmasses in the world, why did Eurasia enjoy a such massive headstart in creating giant empires, like the Roman empire in Italy or the Shang Dynasty in China?” “Why did Australian aborigines fail to move beyond the stone age on a timescale of thousands of years whereas the Europeans succeeded in creating and sustaining a modern nation state within two centuries of landing on the western coast of the continent?”Many answers have been proposed and depending on your worldview, you may prefer one over several others. In the pre-Renaissance era, the view of most people pondering over such matters can be summarized in a simple sentence: “They are filthy savages, we are civilized humans. That’s it” With the advent of biological evolution, efforts were made to recast the answer in more scientific terms: “Just as the Cro-Magnons were an evolutionary upgrade on the Neanderthals, so are we (Europeans/ Caucasians) a more advanced form of humans vis-à-vis the blacks/aborigines/Indians.” In retrospect, it might sound hilarious, but at that time, serious research works were carried out to show that Africans have a more primitive skull structure akin to the Chimpanzees. And then came Mendel with genetics and it did not take much time for people to weaponize that concept either. The Nazis believed they were a genetically superior race and actively carried out eugenics to optimize favorable hereditary characteristics among their people, despite zero science to back up such a genocidal social policy. To this day, the genetic superiority theory has no shortage of preachers and evangelists. The likes of Sam Harris and Jordan Petersen are going around the globe and brandishing psychologist Charles Murray’s Race-and-Intelligence Bell Curve. The implication is pretty straightforward, “Look mate, even if slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the likes did not happen, the African Americans would still be hard-pressed to climb up the social ladder since they are genetically indisposed to do so. Sad!!” The appropriation of scientific concepts by intellectuals of the social science disciplines to justify confounding claims is nothing new. And as I have already stated, each individual would be amenable to a different answer to this question depending on how he/she perceives the world-at-large. So, in the marketplace of ideas, who should we subscribe to? In other words, which discipline or branch of science is best-suited to answer this question? And the answer is: Anthropology. Wild as it may seem at first, you would think the responsibility to answer a question regarding humans should befell the people whose job is to literally study humans.And this is where this book shines brightly. Jared Diamond does a fantastic job of breaking down the geographical, agricultural, political and social forces that propelled different people to very disparate directions. But most importantly, this book stands as a solid buttress to human capital. Given the right tools and right conditions of existence, anyone possesses the mental faculty to do anything they would want to do. No one is genetically incapacitated to be an engineer or a physicist. But if you choose to believe otherwise, that is your prerogative. Just read the book and see if it can challenge, if not alter radically, your worldview. "
1138,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145461-rindis,3,"To a certain extent, I've always wondered why Guns, Germs, and Steel caused such a huge splash. The main premise boils down to 'differences in geography cause differences in societies and their history', which belongs to the club of the blindingly obvious.Of course, the real point of the book is to pin down just which differences are the important ones. This is a cause for much arguement, but Diamond has successfully pulled out the most important ones as applied to history as a whole. This largely turns into a study of what plants and animals were successfully domesticated in early prehistory, and how that turned certain areas into the origin of settled agriculture. That is still fairly basic stuff, but benefits greatly from studying the results from all around the world all at once, and examining just what it takes for something to be capable of being domesticated. (I know there's been some interesting work done on that since this book came out, but I haven't seen it escape scholarly journals in more detail than a National Geographic article.)From there, Diamond points out how plants and animals are generally adapted to a certain climate, and that while it is fairly easy to find different climates going east and west (due to cold mountains, dry deserts, wet coasts, and other accidents of geology), large differences of climate are guaranteed when traveling any real distance north and south. Looking at a map and noting that the Americas and Africa are divided into north-south zones, while Eurasia is oriented east-west, then provides material to show why certain areas needed to work everything out independently, while others were able to borrow everything they needed from elsewhere (before the Age of Exploration, the two situations were probably somewhat even by landmass; the book naturally spends much more time looking at the former).The main thing that makes this book new is actually the 'germs' part of the book. It is only fairly recently that we've really become aware of where most of the deadly diseases we have to deal with come from—other animals. So societies that have and live closely with lots of domesticatible animals get to suffer from deadly epidemics when an occasional virus adapts to a new host (us), and then develop some level of immunity to it. When people who don't have much/anything in the way of domesticated animals run into people who do, they die off as multiple epidemics run through the countryside. This is the other 'new' part—the fact that a lot of Native American population was wiped out by disease is well known, but it's been hard to realize the scale of the disaster. The ""Mound Builders"" were a disappeared pre-Columbian civilization of the Mississippi valley, and only recently has it been realized it was actually wiped out by European diseases before any Europeans got there to see it.The 'guns' and 'steel' parts of the book are essentially non-existent. They just serve as part of the proximate cause of how Europeans came to dominate the world before turning to look for the ultimate causes back in prehistory. This is where his biases as a biologist who's picked up a fair amount of practical cultural anthropology show. While he does discuss technology, and the fact that the wider the range of where you can get ideas from, the more ideas you will be able to encounter, he doesn't spend any time looking at the basics of physical technology. A basic study of easily available copper, tin, iron, and clay deposits, compared with the areas that were able to develop settled agriculture could explain much that remains mysterious to him.It's decidedly a layman's book, and has the advantage of being aware of more current research than any pre-college textbook. The fairly breezy, non-technical writing is set off by a good number of informative charts and maps and allow him to make his points without miring himself in the minutia that would lose the non-dedicated reader. Just being able to tackle most of pre-history in a single reasonably-sized volume is an impressive feat of summarization, and the most impressive thing about the book."
1139,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,4,"I'll let David Graeber speak of this book in a small blurb he wrote about Abdullah Öcalan's ""Manifesto For a Democratic Civilization I: The Age of Masked Gods and Disguised Kings"":""Considering the circumstances under which the book was written, I'd say the achievement here is quite impressive. Abdullah Ocalan seems to have done a better job writing with the extremely limited resources allowed him by his jailers than authors like Francis Fukuyama or Jared Diamond did with access to the world's finest research libraries."" — David GraeberThe conditions of which David Graeber speaks are that of being locked up in solitary confinement with 24 hour/day artificial light illuminating his cell. Allowed to have one book at a time, and oftimes no writing instruments. And the book(s) he wrote were communicated to the public via live speach, or in first draft form written hastily as part of his testimony for his trials.So, is Jared Diamond's book that bad that a guy who's locked up in such brutal conditions can do better? Well, not really. It is almost certain that Jared Diamond reveals important factors that went into the emergence and differentiation of variagrated civilization, it's just that his analysis is definitely incomplete by simple virtue of being more materialistic than that of any hardline marxist. There is very few, and ultimately unconvincing, arguments about the formation of institutions, the emergence of cities, and ultimately of nation-states. And almost no mention of any social movement of any kind.True to the title, the red thread woven through the entire analysis of civilization is done by looking at why certain societies had developed guns, germs, and steel the way they have. It presents rather novel ideas for the layperson not versed in the subject. A quick, and woefully incomplete, enumeration being:1) Euroasia had a geographical advantage because it had more indigenous crops that could potentially be domesticated2) The domestication of said plants could spread from the Fertile Crescent where they first emerged more easily because of relatively uniform climate along the longer axis (east-west) of Eurasia. The Americas suffering from the fact that their longest geographical distance was from north-south, thus cross-cutting through extremely different climates3) Eurasia also had more potential animals for domestication (also goes into why some species are better suited than others), thus Eurasians had a very decisive advantage in terms of the diseases that they developed resistance too, since most ones are of animal origin And so on. You get the picture, right? Fairly solid arguments, and worth carefully studying because they can almost immediately shut up racists, euro-centrists, and so on. But do not think that by reading this book you have garnered enough information about early human history to call it quits. It might be enough to show off at certain parties, but in order to actually synthesise new ways forward there's a long list of problems, not even touched upon, by Jared Diamond."

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
1142,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

Interesting theories presented to the pop culture.The theories here are better formated and oraganized than I attribute to Mann, but it still felt like pulp.

Perhaps if I had read it 23 years ago I might have walked away stunned and overwhelmed with the ideas/concepts in the book? That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas. The peak of this book was in the introduction, wherein he talked about the concerns and pitfalls of a book of this nature. The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts.

1144,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Excellent overview to anthropology study for homo sapiens' cultures. Why the big divides? Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
1145,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."
1147,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11928354-chrisl,4,"For me, Diamond isn't a particularly inspiring writer. I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects. The subject area has been my first choice of speculative focus since my 23 year old freshmen year at Oregon State University. There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share. When I later attended another college, it was a cultural anthropology professor that became one of the few still remembered teachers. This culture in which we live, too, shall pass."

1151,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

1152,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47842317-naia-pard,4,"Disclosure: as the pretty little secondary title would indicate this is indeed a short history of everybody for the last 13.000 years. So, fetch your seat belts and stay put in your seats because the car ride is for the beginners. With that said, this is an introduction to what amounts to be the field work of a lifetime.The edition that I read was the one from the 20th anniversary to which it was added a part that dissected the special situation of Japan`s.Understanding is more often used to try to alter an outcome than to repeat or perpetuate it.p.17I really liked this book. First, the discourse was polite. Second, it had at its basis the idea that the the medium is an important factor that contributed to the uneven human development (technological development). It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species. Maybe the number is a little bit too convenient, but overall, when you think about it that is exactly right.One fair mention would be that the writing can get a little muddled at times. It gets too dense because the author losses himself in details, at times.But it is a good read. Instagram"
1153,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,2,"Full disclosure: I tried to read the book with a fresh mind, but in the end I could not deny that I am biased. I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
1154,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
1156,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."

I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry.

1160,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
1161,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
1162,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."
1163,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"From the prologue:""Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."
1164,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager,3,"Another get from the town transfer station. I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."
1165,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"I can perfectly understand why this book is so successful: Diamond works very methodically, takes his reader everywhere by the hand, constantly clarifies his approach and makes very clear conclusions. And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

1166,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41267182-tariq-fadel,5,"we usually tend to think of the pharaohs and the Mesopotamian civilizations as belonging to an ancient time in the history of mankind. This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America.

It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

1170,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."

It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures.

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
1179,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
1180,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
1181,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
1182,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
1183,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
1184,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail. In terms of subject matter, yeah, there were some interesting bits, but I think this experience sort of clarified to me why anthropology never really grabbed me in college. Just not my thing."

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

This is one of the toughest books I have read, not in terms of vocabulary or sentence construction but dryness. Nevertheless, this is one of the genuine ""books to read before you die"".The author discussed why different continents had different rates of human progress and explains comprehensively that it was not differences in human beings that mattered - it was the flora , fauna and the geographical features that mattered. In effect this shatters overt and covert racism."

1191,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"I read this soon after it came out. I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
1192,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."

Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."
1196,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"Well, I understand why this got a Pulitzer. I hope every student is having to read it in high school. I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
1197,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."

Author Jared Diamond asked questions, provided many answers and left the remainder for debate. Solid facts along with a challenge to think outside the box are a good combination. Absorbed in deep thought I felt at times that I had drifted back to college days plundering through a textbook, minus the social life, but my spirits lifted with the knowledge that when the “Acknowledgement” section came into view I would not be taking a final exam on my absolute retention.

1200,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138926-clint,3,"This book was three stars all the way through until I started reading the epilogue, which I thought was five stars, then I got to the second half of the epilogue, and it went back down to three. This is a really informative book, albeit a little dry. There is only so much information about corn and wheat that I can process on a given day. Most of the book was that, corn and wheat and cereal and grains and lots of other boring food words, and also a lot of linguistic stuff, which was pretty interesting, and some cool things about diseases (basically the reason you have such a kickass immune system is because your granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy slept with horses), but almost nothing about guns, which was what I was hoping to read. There is LOTS of repeating in this book, LOTS AND LOTS, and I think the epilogue (the first half, anyway) tells you much more succinctly what the first 400 or so pages said. And the book still barely answers the primary questions it started out with, mainly why has the whole world pretty much been run by Europeans (or Americans) for the last 500 years. Oddly, the book takes you right up until 500 years ago, then kind of runs out of steam right when it would be getting interesting. In the epilogue he timidly, slowly begins to touch on what to me seems really obvious, i.e. culture, but I guess in academia that's something you have to tip toe around. It's not at all hip or kosher to slam someone's culture, but culture has tons and tons to do with why and how a country functions the way it does. Give a certain group of people all the benefits in the world, but when corruption is accepted as a necessary part of society, when rabid nationalism and worship of anyone older than you is seen as the only way to not be an asshole, and when any new idea is seen as ridiculous strictly because it's new, you're going to have problems. Another thing that kind of irked me about this book was the continual use of putting certain phrases in quotation marks, like the ""discovery"" of the New World. Yeah, dork, I get it, no one really ""discovered"" the New World after 10,000 years ago, but I'm not a 10 year old brainwashed student, I get it. Another funny thing was he kept calling it a racist viewpoint to hold that white Europeans were so powerful because of a genetic superiority (and I would also think it's kind of racist), but then he turns around and says, in his opinion, New Guineans are on average more intelligent than Europeans. Typical guilty white liberal. So it's racist to say Europeans are smarter than other people, but not racist, I guess, to say New Guineans are smarter than other people? This kind of skyscraper-sized inconsistency is what drives me up the fucking wall when reading these kinds of books, and makes me feel there will never be any real progress in the social sciences because everyone's so sensitive about what they should or shouldn't say.

1201,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983551-neil-pearson,3,"I've known of this book for a long time and have even seen a documentary based on it so I finally took the plunge. I really like the central idea that the environment has shaped human societies (for better or worse) and that there isn't an intrinsic difference between people's of different environements - we're all suited to get the most out of our particular niches. I also understand the cascade effect of domesticating plants and animals. My issue with the book is that Diamond takes a far too deterministic view and makes individuals/groups to be mere passengers in the sweep of environmental history and I think that's too simplistic. While history may play out similarly based on the axis of the Earth I don't think it would play out exactly the same because there are simply too many variables. I did enjoy the discussion on plant and animal domestication though and the link with disease was fascinating. There's another fun snippet of linguistics as a historical tool (which is expanded upon in ""the third chimpanzee"") and the discussion on geographical barriers is interesting.I didn't enjoy his reductionist view on inventions and the idea they just happen along with the head-scratching claim that most ideas are acquired from other places (but they still have to come from somewhere!). He also has the habit of being a tiny bit apologetic when it comes to western society (in the sense they were lucky as opposed to justifying their actions) which I suspect is a knee-jerk reaction to all the imperialist works suggesting it's because Europeans were better than the ""savages"" but I think it would have been best to stick with the idea it's the environment that's shaped societies (although it's always going to be difficult to separate a leader's views from their environment). Diamond also skims over religion yet again which I always find frustrating but there is at least a brief discussion of its role in societies and how it can be used as a justification/tool in colonisation.The epilogue is very good at addressing a lot of my issues with some of his claims and convenient omissions throughout the book. The problem is that by that point I was already frustrated with some of the things he'd said (or hadn't) and that jaded my view of most of his claims in the main text. I'd certainly recommend new readers to skip to the epilogue after the introduction before reading the meat of the book as I know I'd have enjoyed it far more knowing he'd taken these other interpretations into consideration.Another fun thought I started to have towards the end of the book was that Yali might have wished he'd never asked Jared the cargo question if he'd had to listen to an 11 hour answer.It's still a great book for getting you to alter the way you look at things and I think it's something fantasy authors should look at when drawing their world maps too (I know I can't help but wonder where their fertile crescents are)!"

I found half the book almost entirely repetition and the latter bit on languages complexly boring and a hassle to follow. Every other page there would be a half page digression restating a dozen things already stated. It was a neat read. BUT I felt empiricism was a bit lacking at times. while much of the book is convincing, much of it is also the authors OWN opinions based on correlations/causations/inference style arguments to justify his ideas, some of which diverge from generally accepted ones. He has a tendency to infer and correlate and then peat himself so much so that by the time I finished the book I was cursing it.I was expecting something vastly different. this entire book is about food production and geographic inhibitions of it, which consequently benefit Eurasia while be disadvantageous to other places such as Australia. It has a very unempirical feel to it. The author himself even mentions people will disagree with his methodology and tries to back it up by calling sciences like Astronomy, historical science rather than actual science. The epilogue made me really dislike the author for his assumptions about some sciences not being sciences like astronomy. He claims you cant test anything and so, basically, he is saying his interred theories should be valid.. because as he sees it, Astronomy isn't scientific in that you cant test it. Just... wow... He also dismissed individual geniuses like Einstein... shrugging them all off... claiming that they were basically just lucky to be the ones that and the final touches on some innovation. The author, thus, comes off as very narcissistic and self absorbed in his own intellect. whether he is or not, I don't know, but the epilogue certainly suggested it.The first half was great. As I got maybe 60-70% through I grew weary and tired of his line of logic. I had hoped this were to be more factual based, than hypothetical. It felt as though I were reading someones PHD thesis by the end. He also has this irritating habit of mixing up the words is and are, making some sentences read oddly.I may seem vexed and I am. This book could have been a fraction of the size it was. I felt cheated by being forced to read so much repetition (yup, i am repeating this complaint again). I may not have picked this book up had I known what lie past the half way mark. Alas, I hate to leave a book unfinished, and it was interesting at times. I feel as though good chunks must be taken with a grain of salt. There are facts thrown in here and there however, I was expecting more of an actual history of civilizations/empires themselves, not so much a discourse on food production.

1204,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290837-ken,5,"Guns, Germs, and Steel (GGS) is an illuminating and sweeping panorama of human history. It is thought-provoking, logical, and debunks racist theories by highlighting the undeniable significance of geographic and climatic influences on the developments and progressions of human societies. For example, civilization and technology spread fastest throughout the Eurasian continent partly due its vast width and its east-west latitudinal axis, which allows for a fairly consistent temperate climate and a quicker spread of food production. Food production leads to societal/political organization and specialization of labor. This yields more leisure time to the educated elites, allowing them to cogitate, innovate, and develop world-changing technologies like gunpowder, the printing press, and the steam engine. The second largest continents, Africa and the Americas are narrower in width and have a north-south axis. This makes it more difficult for food production and peoples to spread since they have to transgress climatic hurdles (certain foods only grow at certain elevations and latitudes) such as the Sahara Desert and the Isthmus of Panama. Secondly, Africa and the Americas had fewer native, domesticable animals. Eurasia had horses, dogs, goats, cows, and sheep while North America and Africa had the less effective camels, llamas, and alpacas. Horses aided Eurasians in warfare, dogs in hunting, and goats, cows, and sheep on the farm in food production. You might be wondering- what about the vast animal diversity in Africa? Well, Africa’s zebra (the horse’s closest equivalent) is finicky, fearful, unaccommodating, and to this day has still not been domesticated. We all know how the various feline species (lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) are less submissive than dogs and therefore less domesticable. In its title GGS explains how the proximate factors of guns, germs, and steel enabled Europeans to first sail to the Americas and conquer the Native Americans and not the other way around. The ultimate factors that explain why the Europeans first came to possess guns, germs, and steel are due to their head start in food production and availability and use of domesticable animals (from which they derived many of the germs that would later wipe out the Native Americans). Eurasia also had more diverse plants available to begin and sustain food production. This book is a beast to get through (especially when reading about plants), but the sense of satisfaction and illumination obtained after conquering the beast and becoming more understanding of why societies developed at different rates is well worth it. Well done, Diamond. "

However, my eyes were opened to the genre over the summer when I read a phenomenal, fast-paced non-fiction novel for my AP Biology class, The Demon in the Freezer. This was no Demon in the Freezer.For starters, barely 30 pages into the book, the first red flag popped up. Jared Diamond is not a historian. Nor is he an anthropologist. Rather, he is an evolutionary biologist. So, okay. There's a slight connection. But still, I felt that it called into question his expertise on the topic. I found Diamond's writing to be terribly dry. Granted, history is, to me, not exactly the world's most exciting topic, but surely it could have been less bland. Maybe a joke or two? A pun? Something to keep the reader engaged? I didn't care much about the vast majority of the topics. Only a few really interested me, which I acknowledged was not the book's fault. But it was mighty difficult to trudge through each boring chapter. My only salvation was that each chapter was broken up into little mini passages, so I could give myself rewards for finishing a single passage. You think I'm kidding? Ask Alex.Another thing that saved this book from a DNF? The pictures. They were frequent enough for me to look forward to them and get excited whenever one popped up. It meant I didn't have to read a page! But the one strange thing about the pictures was that there were two twenty-page (each!) sections of the book that were simply photographic portraits of different people. There was not even a single mention of these photographs until the epilogue of the book, so I was like ""what is going on"" whenever one of these sections popped up literally in the middle of a sentence.The final gripe I have with the book was one section of a chapter in which Diamond did not write anything. Well, he quoted. He quoted for an entire chapter. Basically, it went down like this:""so, the invasion of the Incas by the Spanish was pretty bad but I don't really feel like explaining it to you, so here's a couple primary sources""Thanks??? The only reason this book deserves two stars is that at least some of the content is interesting. And, I must admit that I did learn something at the end, which is the point of a non-fiction novel.Overall, this just wasn't the book for me. It was terribly dense, bland, and boring, and had me watching the page count like a hawk, just waiting for page 431 to pop up. "
1206,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837466-dree,3,"This book is full of interesting ideas. What it is not full of is citations. Actually, there are NO citations. No footnotes, no endnotes, just the dreaded ""further reading"" sections in the back. Am I the only one that hates that? I doubt it.As I began reading I was flagging pages I had questions about. So many pages were flagged a gave up. This would be a GREAT book for discussion--in class, or in a book group. Me? I am arguing with myself and looking things up on Wikipedia. Not ideal.So...Diamond never defines ""agriculture"" or ""domestication"" to my satisfaction. Nor (obviously) does he give a source for a standard archeological or anthropological definition of either. Yet I kept wondering, through the entire book, where he was drawing lines. Native Australian canals for eel raising/harvesting is not domestication, not is it agriculture. So what is it? How does it not ""count""? I know the author has studied a lot in New Guinea. He talks about it. A lot. Yet India is virtually invisible in this book (except for the Chinese, Austronesians, and Europeans that traded there). Why? Why not a tidbit about Japan?Anything else you ask? Why yes. The author's tone is somewhat condescending, there is too much first person for my taste (""I think it is obvious"" ""When I was in New Guinea""), too many determinedly wobbly statements (such as ""make this inference virtually certain"" (348) and ""I would guess"" (349)), and way way WAY too much speculation (""What if Hitler had died in 1930?"" ""What if the Inca had..."" what if what if what if). There are also many statements like ""Protein starvation is probably also the ultimate reason why cannibalism was widespread in traditional New Guinea highland societies."" (p149). Really? Citation(s)? Please pretty please? That's a huge statement to stick a ""probably"" in the middle of, with no backup.So...what do I think? I don't know what to think. The book is interesting, if annoying. But without citations I really can't form a true opinion. I don't think Diamond has invented a new discipline ""Historical Science"" as he seems to think he has (epilogue). I would argue this book isn't a history book at all, it's geography, or anthropology. It's historical, yes, but it's not history.And I think it's a bit of a ripoff of Alfred Crosby. Whom Diamond mentions, but I don't think he gives him the credit he deserves."

1208,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7955372-ian-tymms,5,"One of those books you wonder how you missed. Getting on for 20 years old now but its basic thesis - that geography not genes is the determining factor as to why the Old World dominates the New - still struck me as clear, thoughtful and powerfully argued. The detail and complexity of what Diamond had to say was both compelling and surprisingly readable; I read every one of the 440 pages and a few of the endnotes to boot. One small quibble: in the 2003 afterward, Diamond discusses some of the implications raised by his final reflection in regards to the organisation of groups of people and the role of leadership in history. Specifically, he discusses conversations with the likes of Bill Gates about how best to organise teams in business. Whilst the conclusions of these reflections may be reasonable (they seemed so to me), they seemed to miss what I take to be the main point of the book: it is the geographical circumstances of humanities history which has been most clearly deterministic rather than specific human cultural or behavioural characteristics. The corollary of this observation in business would seem to me to have much more to do with the kind of industry and its location than with the behaviour of CEOs and employees. I would have thought Diamond's considerable insights might be more powerfully directed towards reflecting on where, when and how industries are located and the consequent implications for their success. This kind of reflection seems to me to fit more appropriately with the ""scientific"" approach he so consciously devotes to his approach in the bulk of ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"".Regardless, this is a powerful, brilliant book which has shaped and coloured my thinking and filled in some important holes in my understanding of the parts of the world where I live. I'm off to write a post on my blog about the Boonwurrung, the people whose culture and land my ancestors destroyed with their guns, germs and steel."
1209,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57132772-lin,2,"Full disclosure: I am writing this in one unpremeditated, unedited go, mostly on the adrenaline of deep frustration.It is baffling to me how dismissive—almost disdainful—Diamond is of the Chinese writing system throughout, with a level of unqualified criticism uncharacteristic of the rest of the book. “For example,” Diamond writes, “the prestige value of Chinese culture is still so great in Japan and Korea that Japan has no thought of discarding its Chinese-derived writing system despite its drawbacks for representing Japanese speech, while Korea is only now replacing its clumsy Chinese-derived writing with its wonderful indigenous hangul alphabet.” Is this what so-called objective “scientific writing” looks like? I don’t know who Diamond’s supposed Japanese and Korean friends are (he cites these nebulous figures once, with the affectation of one claiming “My black friends don’t ask me to say African-American”), but as a native Chinese speaker who did not learn the language through Diamond’s expressly preferred, Latin alphabet-based pinyin, as well as a Japanese speaker, I call Massive Bullshit on his unfounded, unprofessional condemnation.This is compounded with an additional 2003 chapter on Japan and Korea whose “guys, you’re ‘twin brothers,’ why don’t you make peace for the progress of humanity” policy recommendation I found condescending.I understand that these only make up a small percentage of what is an ambitious, expansive, painstakingly detailed cross-disciplinary work, but it was enough to deeply bother and distract at least one reader. I also find that, in the wake of Yuval Noah Harari’s bestsellers and the rise of scholarly podcasts, Diamond’s fact-dumping narrative voice is startlingly humorless, sometimes to the point of somnambulant. Having been told for almost a decade that this is a seminal work I must read to understand the world, this fell short of expectations—to say the least."
1210,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4699853-dara-salley,4,"I was less astounded by “Guns, Germs and Steel” than I might otherwise have been, partly due to the success of the book. Diamonds ideas are simple and persuasive. I’m sure that when they were first expounded in the 1997 that they created quite a stir. In the past two decades they have become part of the mainstream. I’m not sure when or where, but somehow I’ve heard almost all his arguments before. They’re part of my psyche. Reading Diamond’s book was less of a revelation for me and more like learning the details of something I already know.“Guns Germs and Steel” is about as thrilling as a book full of facts can be. It’s like attending a very interesting anthropology lecture; it’s work, but fun work. There were some moments when I zoned out a little. I felt that Diamond provided too many examples, but this complaint probably relates to what I said earlier. I came to this book already informed of Diamond’s thesis and halfway convinced. This made all the arguments somewhat superfluous for me.It’s a very intellectually satisfying book. Any mildly empathetic person will look at the inequities of the world feel frustrated. We want an answer that explains why terrible things happen to innocent people. Some find the answer in religion and the unknowable nature of God. If that isn’t a good enough answer for you, Diamond’s book will help fill in the gaps. He draws lines from climate and geography to colonialism, providing, if not a solution, at least and explanation for all the pain in the third world. I’m not saying that his arguments are 100% correct, but they will make you feel a little closer to finding order in a chaotic world."
1211,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4," Jared Diamond’s Pulitzer Prize winning book about how and why civilization emerged the way they did was very introspective and engaging. He is a biologist who lived in New Guinea. He came to appreciate the native people there and one in particular, Yani asked him why westerners had so much relative to the natives on New Guinea. He explored the reasons for why civilizations emerged as they did.Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture and written language in an interesting way. His explanation on the advantages of East-West orientation between Europe and Asia over North-South orientations of Africa and the Americas helped to explain why some areas dominated over others. Having navigable river systems instead of mountains and deserts helped spread the domestication of farming and the domestication of animals. Therefore, the emergence of farming flourished more in some areas, Eurasia, over others. All animals in nature could not be domesticated and used for farming like some of the big animals in Africa.Guns were a force in dominating some societies and the materials necessary are not found everywhere on our planet. He discussed the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by urban dwellers, and the harm caused to these urban dwellers who came in contact with the people who lacked these immunities. Steel was used for the making of weaponry and machinery so became prominent in later years. Diamonds explanations were cohesive and understandable. It is essential reading for anyone interested in reading how civilizations emerged."
1212,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"I finally finished this classical anthropology book, which has been sitting on my TBR in last 5 years. It took me weeks to read, as I moved forward/backward a lot to get a better understanding and to become familiar with the details. Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is the macro history of human societies. This book is based on solid research and written as a text book--an introduction followed by well-organized chapters, each chapter contains detailed descriptions, a conclusion that summarizes the main points made in the book, ended with an epilogue where future enhancements and competing theories are briefly discussed.Geographical environment, including flora and fauna, shaped the early development of human societies. Its ripple effect is still felt today. There are lot of great, very interesting points. One of them is the comparison between the three regions of the old world: The Fertile Crescent, Europe and China. Was The Fertile Crescent the first region in the world where the environment made inhabitable by the inhabitants? China's early unity, a result of its environment, shaped China into a technological and social advanced country. However, from 15th century onwards, the same unity became a negative force and caused China to lag behind.Again, the book is the macro history, the board sketches of the past 11000 years of human life, not the micro history or the role of random events in the course of history. A full 5-star non-fiction."
1213,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964113-rise,4,"Amusing to read the slew of negative reviews in Amazon. It's hardly surprising though, given the subject matter of the book and its revolutionary approach to the interpretation of history. Prof. Diamond presents his case well that I think some of the debated quotes in the reviews were taken out of context, or were taken as absolutes. I can imagine why some arguments are controversial. They're not always ""politically correct"" and often run against conventional knowledge. Prof. Diamond is talking about the origin of ""races,"" why some are more affluent than others and why some are not destined to prosper. His central argument is quite basic: environment, not race, is the main determinant of success of societies. Very humane and obvious but still debatable. What is impressive is the wealth of evidence presented and the manner in which they are analyzed. The environmental approach to history can run the risk of the ""comprehensive syndrome,"" i.e., too detailed and sweeping and long, that it sometimes reads like a chore. I read it on and off for almost a year. It was like attending a course in ecology. On the strength of this book, I'd likely attend more lectures by Prof. Diamond through his other books."
1214,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17754981-stephen-yoder,4,"I had many ""whoa"" moments while reading this book. I had never realized that corn took so long to travel from the highlands of current Mexico to areas of the current USA. Once I got Diamond's point that many Eurasian epidemics have their roots in the diseases that strike domesticated animals of Eurasia I definitely smacked my own forehead. Wow. Using comparative linguistics to determine which people ate which plant or animal first is amazing. Food production, geography, environmental factors, domesticable animals, natural resources -- all of these things have greatly influenced the ebb and flow power from one region's peoples to another, and back again. Race, however, has not been a determinative factor. It is important to read books like this today when various groups express racist narratives about entire nations of people -- ""They don't send their best people"" or ""shithole countries.""Diamond's sense of humor and humility are steady currents underlying the entire book. He prefaces some sections with statements like, ""This chart will horrify academic experts in this field. . . but I generalize for a reason."" The story about the bedside interpreting at a hospital gone wrong is not one to be forgotten (hysterical!).I highly recommend this book. "
1215,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12486689-betty-ho,4,"The one sentence to summarize this book is ""history followed different courses for different people because of differences of the environment, not of biological differences among people themselves."" The logic behind is fairly straightforward - weather/ landscape affects wild plants/ animals availability for domestication which in turn affects the chance of food production and thus gems, technology, writing and eventually politics. Therefore, the reason you were born in a developed country and are more educated and wealthier is because your ancestors were lucky enough to be born in certain part of the world, NOT because your are smarter nor your gene is better than the rest of the world.I like the way how the author elaborates his logic. He uses tons of historical examples plus archeology discoveries - a perfect marriage between history and science. Although the empire of climate can only explain first half of the world history (probably until the time of medieval as the courses of modern history are far too complex to be explained only by environmental factors), this book has already provided answers to many many questions.    "
1216,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5936947-sean-chick,4,"Diamond's synthesis argues for geography not as the sole decider in human affairs but certainly as the main one. Any work of this sweep is going to have holes in its particulars, but Diamond is overall very persuasive. Yet, there is one serious failing that I detected: his discussion of technology. Diamond wants to reject the racial explanation for why whites came to dominate the world. In this he is right, but he goes too far. European technological superiority came in the main from the scientific revolution. This in large part explains why Europe became the center of world power. While Diamond is right that geography formed the basis for that revolution, there was something deeper happening in Europe that allowed for the swiftest technological revolution in history. And while the ""Great Man"" view of history is certainly false, it has its uses. Diamond, at least in his thoughtful conclusion acknowledges that. It is the great strength of the book; he makes a good argument but is no brute reductionist. Nuance is welcome.Last thing: the pictures in the book are the most bafflingly useless I have ever seen in a major work."
1217,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35395038-amith,5,"I am glad I picked up this book. If only I could throw hardbound copies of this book (weight: 2.1 lbs) at the faces of people going around distorting history. It presents a fascinating take on the evolution of human societies and manages to answer very fundamental and difficult questions in a clear and objective manner through the combined lens of geography, biology, linguistics and economics. One of the biggest statement the book makes is to show how strongly environmental quirks outside their control affect the trajectories of the societies living in it. I expected the book to be quite similar to Sapiens by Yuval Harari but they are very different books. I remember Yuval being a lot more personal with his narrative. Also, Jared is a lot more detailed in his materialistic comparison of different societies. I would have liked more information on how the Indian Subcontinent was populated. It does not find much mention. But stating that is not to deny the wealth of information that this book already offers.Published in 1997, it is 20 years old today but still highly recommended! "
1218,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,As a scientific book it fails overall.Pro:Diamond seems very sympathetic towards all people and cultures. He also knows a lot about different ways the societies collect food and in what environment they live in. Things he probably has learned from studying birds.Con:This is how not to do science. Most of his great conclusions are loosely based on the findings he picks out to support his ready made conclusions. Nothing is proved or disproved in any way in this book. And he completely ignores genetics and biology even though he talks about people who have adapted to different environments. Sure one group can have been adapted to an environment where there were fewer things to plant and fewer animals to tame. But how did that influence people's genetics? Because it must have done. Everything does. Where do we stand? This book was boring and not informative. It's basically a collection of facts mixed in with random opinions/assumptions. But I still like him and he seems sympathetic as a person.

I listened to the abridged audio (I hadn't realized it was abridged until I checked it out of the library, but decided to give it a shot, anyway). I'm not sure if some of the stuff that I think I missed (phrases that ""suddenly"" appeared without a definition, etc) was because I was not paying attention momentarily, or if it was something that was cut out of the book for the abridgment. I don't know if it would have made a difference if the version I had was unabridged, but the book was only o.k. for me. Somewhat interesting, but probably nothing I'll remember for any amount of time. I will probably still try another book by Diamond, however. "

I remember them making a big impression on me, so I put it on my to-read list... Fifteen years later, I did it! And I really liked it! Well organized, well explained, I felt like I learned so much, AND I want to keep learning more about human history and geography. In fact, now I wonder if I should've studied archaeology? Is it too late? Man, it gave me so much to think about. Half a point off because sometimes I felt like it was a little too repetitive on certain points."

Then, you have to admire that he somehow successfully drew it all together.The book is dense with information, all there to bolster his argument that geography matters a ton (or as summarised at book club, life is about shit dumb luck).I really liked the study of Polynesia as a microcosm of his theory.If there were crtitiques it'd be that it gets a bit repetitive by the end, and that he's so focussed on his theory he maybe doesn't consider other aspects of humanity (in that sense Sapiens makes an excellent companion volume).Definitely worth a future re-read and note-taking."

Also taken into account is that germs develop very differently with diffferent population densities, and more food requires more and better storage techniques and leads to development of beauracracy as well as expansionist tendencies which become more aggresssive with higher population density.6 August, 12017 HE(the Holocene Calendar)"

Guns, Germs and Steel should've been the start of that journey. If I knew better I would have read this book first and Sapiens after. The two complement each other almost perfectly.Guns, Germs and Steel focuses on the geographic and ecological impact of human development. It was very clear from start that Jared Diamond was fully aware of the limitations of historians to develop the equivalent of a scientific theory and that he made those limitations the strength of this book.I found the last part unnecessary. It functions as the demonstration of the theory, somewhat similar to the predictive properties of a scientific theory but in hindsight. However I felt it added nothing. The epilogue on the other hand is brilliant and fully justifies this last part."

I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the author's beautiful analysis using a very well-constructed framework that is highly nuanced and manages to rigorously explain the broad trends of history in simple language. This book is neither deterministic nor does it justify European colonization. The Epilogue is in itself worth reading in order to appreciate the author's wish to develop a historical science that is inter-disciplinary and follows a rigorous methodology based on natural experiments rather than approaching history through preconceived ideological frameworks."

This is the kind of uncommon reading of history you simply don't hear. It undermines so many casual racial explanations for the development and 'under-development' of the various parts of the globe. I'd say it's a must read just for the excellent geography lesson in every chapter. But the length it goes to in explaining the domestication of plants and animals over time is wonderful as well.

After reading sapiens, if you want to explore more, GGS is your pick. And if you want to delve more into the politcal aspects of history, ""why nations fail"" should be in your hand.

This book was such a disappointment., on so many levels. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. The other 1-star reviews on Amazon are a treasure trove of reasons *not* to read Guns, Germs, and Steel and also other, better books to read. Four I recommend heartily on similar topics:Staring into Chaos: Explorations in the Decline of Western CivilizationThe Fall of Rome: And the End of CivilizationA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, and Human HistoryHive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own Now for my thoughts on Guns, Germs, and Steel. And, admittedly, I stopped reading at about page 100. I could hardly make it through the Prologue. There Diamond provides the germ (no pun intended) of this book, which has its origins in a simple question posed to the author decades ago by an acquaintance as they were walking on a beach in New Guinea: ""Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [material wealth] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?""Diamond immediately dismisses IQ (p. 19), a field of research more than a hundred years old used by governments, businesses, schools, and militaries to great effect (see Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own, Jones, 2016). In one paragraph Diamond dismisses this entire (and proven) body of research and then spends two pages arguing for native New Guineans genetic superiority over European/American peoples. This is classic denial on Diamond's part. Ignore the science that you don't like; embrace what you do like.""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is"" (p. 20). Wow! What a statement! Diamond is using himself as an ""N of 1,"" ignoring thousands of years of history! He continues down his lonesome, illogical path: ""It's easy to recognize two reasons why my impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners may be correct."" This is laughable, but he's serious. So from this nothingness springs Diamond's claim: ""...in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners"" (p. 21). My jaw was on the floor. Absolutely astounding. Here is Diamond's ""scientific process"" in a nutshell: 1. I'm impressed by X. 2. I'll explain X by what I myself believe. 3. What I just claimed about X must be scientifically true.It's perfectly acceptable to claim that New Guineans are ""genetically superior to Westerners,"" but don't you dare claim the reverse. Because that would be racist, right?It's easy to hate white people, and trendy and popular, and Jared Diamond shows us how.But let's see what other researchers have to say about their experiences in New Guinea.o ""And we've had one corpse float by, a newborn infant; they are always throwing away infants here, as the fathers object to observing the taboos associated with their survival"" (Letters From the Field, 1925 - 1975, Margaret Mead, 1977)o ""...infanticide, especially female infanticide, was quite common throughout New Guinea. The Bena Bena, for example, often killed a newborn daughter if the mother already had a small child to care for, and they also typically killed one of a pair of twins."" (Child Abuse and Neglect: Cross-cultural Perspectives, edited by Jill E. Korbin, 1982, p. 14)o ""In New Guinea one can find infanticide, initiation rites, child mutilations, sale of infants for both marriage and sacrifice, and forced homosexuality, to name only the more dramatic examples"" (ibid, p. 13)o When tribal mothers were asked why they killed their infants, they stated it was because they were “demon children,” because “children are too much trouble,” because “it was a girl and must be killed,” or “because her husband would go to another woman” for sex if she had to nurse the infant. Children watched their mothers bury their siblings live, eat them, or toss them to sows to devour—or else they would force the grown-up children to help them kill their siblings or even sometimes make them kill live infants purchased for murdering from other tribes. Mothers who ate their children are described as “overcome by frightful hunger for baby meat”—again, not because of lack of food, but because of an inner need to re-incorporate infants after losing them at birth. (The Origins of War in Child Abuse, Lloyd DeMause, Chapter 7)o ""Females in New Guinea are treated brutally. Since they are routinely viewed as secretly being witches “who can kill simply by staring at a person” (Killer Mother alters), they are often killed simply because they are imagined to have poisoned people. Mothers in New Guinea are horribly abused as girls, being routinely raped by fathers, brothers, visitors, peers, gangs. When they become wives they are treated brutally by men and have suicide rates as high as 25 percent."" (ibid)And one more from DeMause's book:o ""New Guinea mothers constantly “rub the penes of their infant sons [and] the little boys…have erections” while they sleep naked together at night. One boy described to Poole how whenever his mother was depressed or angry she often “pulled, pinched, rubbed, or flicked a fingernail against his penis” until he cried, afraid it might break off. “It hurts inside,” he said. “It bleeds in there and hurts when I pee…Mother not like my penis, wants to cut it off.” Males also masturbated and sucked children’s genitals, both sexes, using the child as a maternal breast as all pedophiles do. Mothers also masturbate and kiss the vagina of baby girls. Malinowski reports watching the widespread sucking of genitals and intercourse between children in Melanesia, encouraged by parents, so that most girls are raped by the time they are seven years old.40 New Guinea fathers rarely care for their little children, but when they do they mainly fondle their genitals, using the child as a breast-object “because they say they get sexually aroused when they watch them nurse.”*This* is the culture and society Diamond states that he *prefers* over Western/American culture/society. What a sick man. That, or he's a liar, or, worse, a charlatan. In any case, Diamond is fooling thousands with his book.Diamond writes: ""Many of the white colonialists openly despised New Guineans as 'primitive.'"" Well, that may have something to do with what those Europeans witnessed: child sacrifice, child rape, forced homosexuality, sales of infants, mutilations, cannibalism, etc etc.What really got me was how Diamond -- a so-called expert in his field -- is *completely* unaware of this previously published research on the absolutely horrific child abuse in New Guinea. But I know about it. No wonder the academic world is in the state it's in. It's a joke, and a bad one at that.Diamond sums up his book in one sentence: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (p. 25). ""Mobile bands of hunter-gatherers are relatively egalitarian..."" (p. 29).Wrong. Hobbes was right. Warfare is in mankind's blood. (see Science shows Thomas Hobbes was right – which is why the Right-wing rule the Earth, The Telegraph, September 29, 2016). Also see quotes on New Guinea populations in above cited works.So even before we're out of this book's Prologue we get a sense of Diamond's biases, scientific research ignorance, and desire to hoodwink his readers. That's a real shame, because he put a lot of effort into this work. But when a reader has to question everything he reads, it's not enjoyable. This work is an excellent illustration of a man with a conclusion in search of a hypotheses. In other words, Diamond does the opposite of what he claims. He's not letting the evidence lead him where it might; he starts with his conclusion in mind and builds a case to support it. He's working backwards. He's not a scientist at all. So, to answer Yali's Question: Your society might get ahead if you stop eating and sacrificing your infants, raping your daughters, sexually abusing your sons, selling your infants into slavery and forcing them into homosexual activities, and abusing your women. That'd be a start. Reading the bookI trudged on.Diamond uses coy phrasing throughout--Great Leap Forward (no, not the Chinese one where multiple millions of people starved or were executed), uses terms like ""colonization"" both negatively and positively, as it suits him; and favors Australia/New Guinea in his discourse. In Chapter 2 in his extraordinarily detailed description of the human colonization of the Polynesian islands, including Hawaii, he fails to mention ritualistic human sacrifice (and cannibalism) as usually practiced for canoe launches, war parties, etc. Diamond mentions gladly the temples on Hawaii but fails to mention human sacrifices practiced there. I wonder why. (Search ""Polynesian human sacrifice"" and ""Polynesian cannibal feasts"" for details.)Chapter 3 reads like some high schooler's breathless explanation of European conquests in the Americas. Surprise! Greater societies conquer lesser societies! Chapter 4. Wow. Chapter 4 is titled Farmer Power, but halfway through Diamond gets sidetracked with horses (and then germs) and their influence on war. Here's a gem: ""The most direct contribution of plant and animal domestication to wars of conquest was from Eurasia's horses, whose military role made them the jeeps and Sherman tanks of ancient warfare on that continent"" (p. 86). Wut? I literally laughed out loud. This book won a Pulitzer Prize? A few pages later:""The peoples of areas with a head start on food production thereby gained a head start on the path leading toward guns, germs, and steel. The result was a long series of collisions between the haves and the have-nots of history"" (p. 99). Was that written by a 10th grader in her Social Sciences class?I can't take it anymore. It's difficult for me to understand how a book like this can be so popular, even winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and then also the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. It's simply discouraging to read (part of) such a poorly written book and know that it's been so successful. But then I sift through hundreds of news feeds and Twitter, and the only thing I can think is that it's trendy to hate white people nowadays, particularly white men, and blame them for every ill in the world.Remember, when Native Americans were putting up mud walls in half caves in Arizona, when New Guineans were killing their children and raping them, and when Native Hawaiians were sacrificing humans, Europeans were building the cathedral at Notre Dame (all events circa 1100 AD).Does culture matter? You bet. And it's important to study the differences among cultures and societies to explain those differences. But this isn't the book to do that. Did not like it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
1232,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,5,"Reading this made me think of the story of the blind men and the elephant; a Jain version of the story reads: The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe.At the end of the book, I did find Diamond persuasive enough to be convinced he had part of the truth, but I admit at this point of my life I'm skeptical of simple explanations that purport to explain everything. Granted, sometimes there are cases like that--at the root of the Theory of a Heliocentric System or Evolution by Natural Selection is a pretty simple concept. But think of trying to explain an individual human being solely by his environment. Similarly, Jared Diamond here tries to explain the ""broad patterns"" of human history by one factor--environment. Geography really. The argument goes something like this. Humans had a ""Great Leap Forward"" around 50 thousand years ago--probably through a reorganization of the brain--that allowed them to invent things more sophisticated than crude stone tools and fire. They then spread to every continent but Antarctica, and about 11 thousand years ago, after the end of the Ice Age, came the Neolithic and the first herding and agriculture. But this is where human society became complicated and unequal. Because the different continents offered a different ""suite"" of animals and plants to choose from for domestication--and in that respect the Fertile Crescent (and to a lesser extent China) were insanely gifted and the continents outside Eurasia poor. Also, the axis of the continents meant diffusion of these developments were much more rapid in Eurasia than the other continents. The package of domesticated plants and animals in Eurasia enabled much greater food production--but also the development of ""crowd diseases"" such as small pox that came with close association with herding animals such as cattle and sheep. The greater food production caused a population explosion that led to more powerful forms of political association devolping and specialization into professions and crafts and with it the invention of writing and other technologies. And all that is at the root as to why when the Old World and New World came into contact, who would win and who would lose was inevitable.There is something very appealing about Diamond's hypothesis. It's a theory of history without heroes or villains. Or at least without nationalist triumphalism or finger-pointing. It's the antithesis of racism. Diamond quickly dismisses the racist IQ theories such as presented in Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve. I'm using ""racist"" here, or trying to, in the objective, neutral definition that it consists of the belief that there are innate differences between subgroups of humans that make some superior to others. Of course, it would have helped if Diamond didn't talk about how he thought natives of Papua New Guinea are probably superior in intelligence to Westerners (tribal warfare and knowledge of natural environment selecting for intelligence more than literacy and video games). But as he'd argue, since that would only cut against the results you'd expect, it doesn't affect his analysis of the important factors that gave some parts of the globe a head start on powerful technologies and social organizations. I'm skeptical of Diamond's claims for his theory as the foundation of a ""science of history"" that could explain nearly everything. As with explaining the formation of individual character, I suspect history is formed by an array of factors--from material factors such as those Diamond details to the ""Great Men"" theory of Carlyle to the cultural and political factors such as those detailed in Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations. Much of Guns, Germs and Steel read like a refutation of Landes' book, which was actually published a year after this one. I don't want to go into the parallels between the books and contradictions point by point, except I think both works are worth reading and provide food for thought. Both agree that ""fragmentation"" of political control (which Diamond again thinks might have geographical roots) might explain why Europe, rather than China, was the center of the scientific and industrial revolutions. I'd give Diamond's book a slight edge over that of Landes simply because I found it more fun to read. I could have done without Diamond's politically correct sensibilities that made it necessary to always put ""discovery,"" ""exploration"" and ""backwardness"" in quotes. At the same time his claim that what happened between Pizarro and Incan Emperor Atahuallpa is ""well-known"" based only on Spanish accounts was eyebrow raising. My eyes did glaze over a bit at the long, involved detailed discussions of linguistics, and many of his points are repetitive. Nothing is cited and sourced. But I found it fascinating to read about that crux between pre-history and history--when and where and why humans first developed agriculture and systems of writing and the development of human diseases. In my geeky way I loved reading about how writing developed independently in Mesoamerica, China and the Fertile Crescent. How writing spread from the Fertile Crescent to Egypt, which developed a system of writing that included an alphabet side by side its hieroglyphs developed into the first alphabet by the Phoenicians. How Sequoyah developed a syllabary for the Cherokee. As a once upon a time political science major in college with my own idiosyncratic political beliefs, I found Diamond's speculations on the formation of the state thought-provoking. I was surprised to find out leprosy is a pretty ""new"" disease that first appeared in 200 B.C. Given its mention in the Bible, I thought it a particularly ancient malady. And did you know chickens were first domesticated in China? Why we type on a QWERTY keyboard? Well, you would have had you read this book."

Interesting theories presented to the pop culture.The theories here are better formated and oraganized than I attribute to Mann, but it still felt like pulp. This book suffers the fate of some critically acclaimed books---many of the ideas and concepts presented in the book are common place or known about today.

Perhaps if I had read it 23 years ago I might have walked away stunned and overwhelmed with the ideas/concepts in the book? That being said, it was a pretty good summary of how/why certain areas of the world developed quicker/faster than other areas. The peak of this book was in the introduction, wherein he talked about the concerns and pitfalls of a book of this nature. The introduction he talks about how in evaluating and comparing world cultures we have to be concerned about conclusions, causations, and facts.

1234,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Excellent overview to anthropology study for homo sapiens' cultures. Why the big divides? Not just for the material but for overall worldview from one part of the globe to another. And especially for those inventions that have also incurred the biggest leaps to change.Diamond centers on the 3 crux issues that initiated such great alterations for living styles in places and under the unique characteristics and mixtures of inputs. But as good as this is, I do not think by cutting the nuggets down to the top 3 (Guns, Germs, and Steel) does that flesh out the complex ""eyes"" as much as the reality that has influenced human ""attention"" (and especially long memory) the most. And that is the font of more than just those three pivotal outcome situations; it is the physical and form of the GEOGRAPHY for the living birthplace.Diamond settles clearly on geography in the observations that human practices spread on an East and West axis to same climate and daylight length habitats. But he just doesn't go far enough, IMHO. Humans will always need food amount and variability to prosper. And productivity to food for one's own family and tribe, eaten without a consistent violent defense for it to taken, has always been a central power for homo sapiens life and communal as a group survival. As it is for animals in other systems of ""eating"" cycles, most not using a communal survival method. How to avoid those periods of ""lack"" which have always occurred. High demand for calories being part of our mammalian warm blooded physicality. Farming, domesticating animals, metallurgy have been the biggest keys, not using only our own muscles. Yes. And ""Big Man"" cultures the chariot that drives all of that, as well. (Egyptian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Incan- all widespread empires). But it is still geography which most usually has the ""last say"" to the eventually of production levels birthing and their possible progressions. If continual need for defensive energy to protect a perfectly formed Western corridor invasion exists (Russia), or if there are no usable harbors, or if the continent covers North to South immense temperature differences every 150 miles because of mountain direction- the eventual coherent features will not be productivity positive or even communication possible for early farmers or hunter-gatherers. If you are interested in this superlative overlook by Diamond, you might be able to appreciate the even more excellent Tim Marsh. Prisoners of Geography Ten Maps that Explain Everything About the World.Those who see the Earth and mankind only within agenda and blame theories will often not want to investigate more important nuggets to ""outlook"". Humans need food, safety, family groups and shelter for survival that will incur invention. Human life was very short, and still is today in those areas which have not been able to develop a food productivity beyond what their own muscles can effect.Having read this years ago, the reread was worth it, but not as enthralling as the first time. Because I've read numerous other non-fiction materials for this subject? Yes, there are many aspects of geographical reality that change ""eyes"" for invention, inspiration, aspiration, consequence to the energy expanded for any specific ""onus"". Both in the individual and societal group senses- our fates ARE in our ""eyes"". How we perceive our place in the world and define goals comes from those ""eyes"". There is an excellent National Geographic 3 long episode DVD series for this ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and I recommend it if you have aversion for this length of anthropological read."
1235,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,4,"This book contains all the good that a scientific approach can provide to the fundamental issues of life and history. Diamond puts all his cards on the table, presents his method of reasoning in a very clear way, clearly defines his questions, tests his hypotheses on his study object and weighs the value of his findings. This is like science should always be: clear, open and honest.Diamond is wondering where the dominance of the Eurasian continent in world history is coming from. In essence, his assertion is that Eurasia had a clear comparative advantage over other continents due to a number of geographical, biological and environmental factors: it was much larger in scope, it had more plants and animals suitable for domestication, and the East-West orientation of the continent (without too many geographical barriers) made the spread and confrontation of ideas, technologies and germs more easily.Diamond's argumentation is strong and cannot be wiped off the table. But as always, his angle better not be regarded as the only one, and Diamond rightfully is endorsed by its critics as a geographic-ecological determinist. I would like to refer to the very interesting discussion between William H. McNeill, the nestor of World History and Diamond in the New York Review of Books (http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1997/...- Upside-down) and the more balanced follow-up by McNeill's son JR McNeill (The History Teacher Vol. 34, No. 2 ,Feb., 2001), pp. 165-174).The weakness of Diamond's approach is especially clear when you focus on the past 500 years and you wonder why specifically the Europeans, on the western side of Eurasia, took the upper hand on the eastern Asian side. Diamond's arguments on this evolution remain inadequate, especially because to me cultural factors were absolutely decisive in this period.This fascinating discussion has developed in what has become the ""Great Divergence"" issue. About the same time as Diamond’s “Gun, Germs…” David Landes published his book The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor, with a rather provocative different approach, highlighting Western inventiveness. This triggered a whole series of corrective studies (Kenneth Pomeranz, John Gunder Frank, John Darwin, ...), and it seems that we can now go for the synthesis, even though a debate like this will never stop completely. Diamond has put on the fire with this book, and despite its flaws we ought to be grateful to him."

G, G and S is absolutely dense with information, its 400+ pages leaving little room for banter.The basic thesis of Guns, Germs and Steel is to examine the question of why different peoples, societies, and nations across the globe have developed so differently - and essentially provide an alternative (and accurate) explanation for differences beyond assumptions about race.Diamond does an excellent job not just explaining his rationale, but also displaying enough general nouse to show that he knows about the topic. I've learnt more than I need to know about comparative linguistics, agriculture and colonization. Probably the most interesting topic is on society structure and how states develop from chiefdoms and tribes etc. My only real criticism of the book is that packed with information as it is, it feels like it isn't going to be accessible to many (although the audiobook may solve that) I'm really happy that I made my way through the tome, but confess its taken a number of weeks reading a few pages at at time."

I tended to lose focus while reading his books; nonetheless, thankfully, he brought widespread awareness to one of my favorite non-fiction subjects.

There, an inspiring professor taught the one anthropology sequence the university offered. Like Joseph Campbell subsequently, his worldview was one I wanted to share.

1241,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,5,"How To Take Over The World In One Simple StepStep 1: Be born into the right environment. Germs, Guns, and Steel attempts to answer one of the more uncomfortable questions of history: why on earth did some civilizations dominate others? Ignoring the various power-struggles that occurred within each continent, why was it the Eurasian explorers who ""discovered,"" conquered, and destroyed so many native civilizations? For far too long, we have clung to the idea that ""the white man's burden"" was to be a somehow superior being to the people he tyrannized. While we've finally dispensed with that old chestnut--at least in polite conversation--the troubling question remains: given that there is no actual difference between peoples, what shaped societies to create the outcomes that we observe? Diamond's answer is simple. (Hint: it's in the title.) In fact, his thesis can be stated even more simply: it's all down to the environment. This doesn't mean to imply that early environment actually shaped better or smarter types of people; all it means is that environments shaped societies in various ways that eventually led to conquest or capitulation. At no point did any of the events of history make one ethnicity or tribe of people actually qualitatively ""better""; the environment only changed the tools available, not the peoples themselves. The book itself can get a bit dry, and I would really like to remember the theories here, so I'm going to summarize the talking points.  One important thing to note: in my summary, I've severely simplified the structure of the book to that of Eurasia against other parts of the world. The book itself looks at a far larger variety of conquests--Māori versus Mauri, Polynesians versus other Polynesians, Incans and Aztecs versus their surrounding groups, and far more--so I've added an emphasis on European imperialism that is absent from much of the book. The first important distinction is hunter/gatherer versus agrarian. I really like how Diamond approaches this: he explicitly states that neither lifestyle is inherently superior, and that those who remained in hunter/gatherer societies did so not because of stupidity or stubbornness, but because it made economic sense to do so. (In fact, early agrarian peoples tended to be malnourished and live shorter lives.) For agrarian societies to work, you need to have fertile land and easily cultivatable crops, and you need to be in a situation that the risk of crop failure can be weathered. Domesticated crops tend to be radically different from the wild versions, and the difference comes, of course, from genetic modification. Since none of the early peoples did much gene-splicing, this meant that early cultivatable crops tended to be ones that required only one or two mutations to become a crop variety. A disproportionate number of cultivatable crops--especially the cereal crops-- turned out to be in Eurasia. This wasn't because of some superior agrarian capabilities of early European people More importantly, the entire setup of Eurasia helped with crop domestication, because in the end, it's all about size (and shape.) Eurasia is pretty darn big, and most of its size is width along a similar latitude, meaning that climate remains comparatively similar and crops can be spread. The same isn't true for little continents or big continents with massive mountain chains in the way, or places where most of the landmass stretches along the longitude.  The other major aspect of the agrarian society, is, of course, the livestock. Yet again, livestock depended heavily on the animals available to the civilization. Eurasia again came out ahead, with thirteen large domesticated animals, including horses, cows, sheep, goats, and more. Why did they end up so far ahead? Continent size is obviously a factor, but there are others: for example, the Americas were inhabited later than Europe, and by explorers who were probably more advanced in hunting and survival. While Eurasian animals were able to slowly develop defensive tactics against the humans, the unlucky American animals who encountered humans probably (literally) didn't know what hit them. While it's hard to find real evidence to back up this hypothesis, there certainly seems to be a suspicious concurrence in dates of human arrival and extinction of certain large animals in the Americas and other locations--all during the Pleistocene era. Livestock improved communication and allowed innovations and inventions to spread, but their crucial importance came from the germs they carried. Most European diseases appeared to bridge from livestock to humans, but it takes a certain amount of time for the diseases to mutate into a human-vector form. Since Eurasia started into the agrarian lifestyle rather earlier, it meant they got a head start on disease--and resistance--development. In fact, the human-to-animal disease issue was initially one reason why the sedentary life actually wasn't a clear winner over hunter/gatherer societies. However, it did mean that Europeans developed a resistance to an impressive set of terrible diseases that they were all too willing to share with their conquests. And then, of course, agriculture changes the population. While hunter-gatherers are forced to travel often and therefore tend to have children only at strategic moments, in an agrarian society, the more kids, the more hands to do the work. Agrarian societies tended to undergo a population explosion, with far denser concentrations that congealed into towns or cities. This, in turn, allowed people to diversify their roles. Given Eurasia's large landmass and population, the probability of having a random person turn out to be an innovator was reasonably high, and improved methods of communication guaranteed that the invention could spread. The fragmented city-state nature of Eurasia meant that no-one could afford to ignore technological inventions because they could be sure that their neighbours wouldn't.  So where does that leave us? Eurasia won the lottery in terms of domesticate animals and crops, meaning that they could drop the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to increase the probability of innovation. However, more importantly, the herding aspect meant that they developed and became resistant to an entire host of animal-borne diseases that would play havoc with the other cultures. Agrarian societies required places to grow crops, meaning that finding new land via exploration was tempting and squabbling with neighbouring countries made it imperative. Which brings us back to what created the world that we know today: it wasn't superior intelligence or skill or planning or religion: it all comes down to the timeless mantra of the realtor: location, location, location.  The tone is definitely problematic at times: Diamond so earnestly disputes the ""superior European"" hypothesis that he has a tendency to drift into ""noble savage""/exoticism mode, most gratingly in his anecdote of Levi, a Blackfoot Indian that Diamond encountered as a child. I found it useful to keep the generational gap in mind: Diamond was born in 1937 and therefore grew up hearing the imperialist theories he so strongly disputes, which I think goes quite far to explain a certain problematic tone at times. The book itself was published in 1997, and it's very Euro-centric because it is explicitly fighting against the idea of inherent European superiority. It doesn't really discuss how Europe itself was created via a succession of conquests that destroyed the true native peoples. It doesn't discuss how areas of Africa and South America (the Amazon, anyone?) remained unconquered for years. It doesn't really discuss the advancement in Asia, mainly because Diamond claims that Asia made a decision towards isolation and was therefore mostly out of the imperialism game. It doesn't talk about various partnerships between indigenous peoples and conquerors, the political machinations, the diversity within a continent, the cultural differences which shaped the outcomes, the ways in which the native peoples had agency in their own fates. To me, the book needs to be examined in context, both of its time of publishing (over 15 years ago) and Diamond's own era. Diamond is really fighting against a prevalent viewpoint of his era: that of biological determinism. His main goal is to refute the idea that some people or some cultures are actually ""better"" than others. He spent time in New Guinea in a time when they were trying to gain their freedom, so the argument about whether whether some people were innately inferior. His real goal is to show that such beliefs have no real validity: initial differences in environment shaped societies, but they didn't alter peoples. He demonstrates that no matter the culture, each society was impressively adept at optimizing their lifestyles to fit their cultures. The real problem with our viewpoint is that we compare cultures not by how well they fit their environment, but how various tangential consequences of these lifestyles led to victory or defeat when the societies clashed with one another. While the cultures were different, nothing about them led to the creation of inherently smarter or ""better"" races of people. In terms of the science, I have to admit that I have very little faith in evolutionary biology, but I think Diamond's impressively methodical examination made a reasonable case; he utilizes a lot of statistical theory surrounding matched pairs and natural experiments, and if you're not familiar with the terms, unfortunately, he made the rather odd choice of saving his brief explanation for the epilogue. To me, the idea of environmental determinism ties into my issues with evolutionary biology: I believe strongly in the role of chance and randomness. When we look back at history, we are in the odd position of seeing one outcome and attempting to provide a deterministic explanation for why this particular reality occurred. I think we need to try to look at it much the same way as we look at the future: choices and situations place different priors on the outcomes--change the odds, if you will-- but we should always leave room for blind chance. Even in Diamond's world, in the end, it all comes down one factor: it's not about who you are; it's about where you live.

It goes on to explain the influences that the spread of the continents and the climate that transverses them had on their people. But first of all, and what it is considered to be the most important aspect in the book, the food production had its heaviest weight in the race towards gaining the upper hand. The reason why Europe became what it became was due to the food production. Did a rise in human population density force people to turn to food production, or did food production permit a rise in human population density? p.107There are insightful observations that go somewhere on these lines:History before the emergence of writing around 3.000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species.

I am not completely against all of Diamond's arguments, but I am totally against his conclusion and potential implication.So we all knew his argument, let's save time and go straight to criticism.Diamond is not new in presenting an argument about the role of long-term factors in history. Fernand Braudel incorporated the sea and the mountains into his historical account decades ago, calling them ""la longue durée."" But perhaps Diamond is very persuasive in presenting a logical and (it seems) very ""scientific"" study of the development of the whole world in general, considering that he is a geo-scientist. His range of examples is impressive (dispassionate, detailed, but quite boring and repetitive, sometimes unnecessary). His reasoning is careful and quite thorough. He is, after all, able to make a clear argument to general audience.The beautiful point that Diamond presents in this book is that he takes away the blame of development (or underdevelopment) from human's biological characteristics. He dismisses the notion that innate inferior or superior qualities decide history the way it is now, but rather puts the ultimate ""cause"" on external factors, many, if not all of which, are uncontrollable. It is empowering that way, saying that we humans are not so different, just the circumstances being put on us are.And this is exactly where the main criticism of the book creeps in. At the same time, Diamond also takes away the very power of humans in making their own destiny. In putting natural endowments into the center of the picture, Diamond sadly generates a sense of hopelessness. So, all of these results are decided from the beginning? So that means that the unfolding of history of the earth would always turn out like this? Geographical determinism, many say.I could not help but have to oppose to this idea. Perhaps my interpretation is too strong here, perhaps Diamond only means to make us be more aware of the fact that geography plays an important role in the course of history, he does not mean that it completely ""determines"" the outcomes. Nevertheless, I would still raise this issue, since I am afraid many will go so far in understanding the implication of the work, that ""history would always turn out that way"" that it is ""inescapable"" that Euroasia rules the world (at least up until the beginning of the 21st century). The inference that ""geography"" determines all is terribly dangerous. It steals away human agency and their ability to overcome constraints and to take possession of their own lives. I am standing on an opposite polar. I acknowledge that geography is strong and very much present. It limits what humans can achieve. But I would argue that it is only ""condition,"" and more importantly, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The outcome of history depends very much on conditions as well as contingencies, on the randomness introduced into the system, by men or by any other external factors. Long-term factors are important, but they do not over-dominate short-term ones as well. Because history has turned out to be the way it is now, it does not mean that there do not exist alternatives that are equally logical and believable. We are so accustomed to a certain way of the world that we could not imagine a parallel universe in which contingencies will make a very different outlook. Ignoring the short-term factors are unavoidable in a work that studies such a large-scale subject. But it marks the limit of that work.Worse, Diamond affirms that those geographical characteristics are still very much relevant in this modern world. Even though now geographical barriers are not as strong as they were in ancient time, the consequences of the past are so huge that it left significant marks on the present and also the future. The most popular example we all know is the adoption of and then the refusal to dispose of the QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, my opinion is that it is not worth that much to replace the QWERTY keyboard, the cost (re-educating, re-manufacturing) is higher than the potential efficiency benefit. And so some consequences of the past sticks, we do not put effort into changing that. Yet, on the other hand, there are issues that definitely needs to be changed and needs human's willingness, co-operation, and hope. One of such is obviously the large issue of development. Diamond, it seems to me, underestimates the creativity and capability in humans to fight against natural limitation. Perhaps I am too optimistic, I believe too much in ""free will."" But what is the meaning of life without ""free will?"" One may argue that ""free will"" exists in individual level only, and that history and the world in general never turn out to be the way human consciously plan them to be. But I am always, in my mind, occupied by the question of development. At least, I feel that, in the present day when so much knowledge is made available, what we could do, for instance, to make a country economically successful despite its past is a daunting task, but not an impossible one, as I find so vividly in the example of South Korea.Again, I hope that Diamond is not actually making such an extreme argument. Nevertheless, he does play down the role of short-term factors and human agency, perhaps in order to celebrate the significance of the long-term ones. As a result, it is possible to make too strong inferences as well. And I want to warn against such inferences. There is a minor issue with the last section of the book when Diamond talks about the discipline of history. Hah, he is not engaging in the latest argument in the field about how history is science or art. But I won't dwell in the matter here. "
1244,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Why did Europeans spread all over the world, and not Polynesians or Aztecs? Because they had guns, germs and steel, which those other societies did not. But why did they have them? Jared Diamond traces the advantage back to early and wide adoption of food production, which in turn was based on environmental conditions, and not innate abilities. Food production enables the feeding of specialists who are not themselves food producers, thus enabling the development of new technologies, such as metal working and writing, which in turn accelerate development.Food production developed earliest in the fertile crescent in South-West Asia, and spread quickly towards east and west within the temperate zone, on the largest continent with only mild physical barriers. So Europe, North Africa, South and East Asia, China all quickly acquired it. It turns out that the fertile crescent had an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species - something all other areas were poor in or completely lacked. Subsaharan Africa, for instance, only domesticated sorghum, millet and yams, all less nutritious as harder to produce than wheat and barley. And only Euroasians had animals capable of pulling plows or being ridden. The horse was a tremendous advantage in agriculture, transportation, and war, and the rest of the world simply did not have them.Diamond compares and contrasts environments, the spread of humans, and their state of food production and technology among all inhabited continents. He talks a lot about Polynesia, New Guinea and Australia, because the environment there produced many isolated areas where human development attained numerous forms. He reviews societal development from bands through chiefdoms to states. He uses many different sciences to trace prehistoric human movements: ethnography, biology, linguistics, archeology. He talks lengthily of traits that qualify or disqualify plants and animals from domestication.There are many fantastic revelations. I found it very interesting that food producing societies that settled areas that were difficult or impossible to cultivate, reverted to hunting-gathering. Or that while the Mayans invented the wheel, it was not adopted due to lack of draft animals. I had no idea that the highly infectious diseases that destroyed other cultures developed from domestic animal diseases, to which their keepers - Europians and Asians - had developed resistance, but societies without domestic animals did not. I also learned that the analysis of languages could yield a huge amount of historic info. Fascinating and tremendously educational, although sometimes a bit too technical at the expense of narrative. Once you have read it though, you will never think of rich vs. poor countries the same way again."

Considering I am just beginning to specialize in history, I must first note that I lack the knowledge-base to properly review such an ambitious project. GGS grapples with why Eurasian societies were the ones conquering and colonizing, and not vice versa. Yet this explanation is formed through a science-specific lens, which fails to give the entire picture (to note I do not think an entire ""picture"" is feasible). Diamond focuses on how three main environmental factors gave rise to invention, power, and colonization. According to Diamond, climate, the domestication of animals and plants, and continental axes molded both large and small scale societies into what they are today. Yet his approach is steeped mainly in the sciences, and alludes to a sense of geological determinism which leaves out room for the impact of human events and human agency. For Diamond, history was a matter of the have and have-nots, and that depended more on a people's real estate than their genetic make-up. Dr. Diamond does an excellent job in erasing and disproving all racial theories, yet geography cannot be the sole factor in assessing world history and it's cause-effect relationships. I simply can't help but feel that a big piece of the cake is missing here.Overall a highly informative read which makes you look at the assessment of history in a different manner, however don't let him deceive you..he doesn't have all of the answers.TO ADD...my professor brought up a great point on this read, in that his presentation of events, as propelled by geography, Diamond completely disregards historical context. How then can you call this a history? A pertinent example would be his reasoning behind the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. Diamond focuses on how the Eurasian ""real estate"" brought the Spanish to the Americas, but what about the fact that the Spaniards had just thrown out the Moors in their own country? Couldn't this historical event play into the cause of conquest? "
1246,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,3,"The book seemed almost as long as the history of human development, though it was only 440 pages. It took a lot of resolve to finish though I did feel intellectually rewarded. The content was a convincing argument against the supreme race theory.It is sort of a research paper made into a very readable book that deals with the question : What contributed to the different rates of progress of civilization and what lead to colonization across the different continents? The short answer is - Geography and Chance! Looking through the different lenses of geology, culture, food habits, animal domestication, language and loosely technology the book explains the rise of the dominant population across regions.Most chapters make you wonder and then buy into the argument of the author's well presented case. And since you don't get to cross examine, you are left somewhat convinced. But then, the author goes overboard with reiteration. In consulting, we call it applying the framework and the answer to every question he asks would invariably be presented in his framework of research. Of course there are some wow insights - like how continents that have East-West spreads were able to dominate their geology better than North-South spread. After a point, it gets repetitive since it is almost the same story. I loved the chapters of Maori tribes dominance, the African story and the chapter on evolution of writing. Though Guns, Germs and Steel is more catchy as a title the book is a lot more about Geography and Time. This kind of analysis might not be relevant to extrapolate from here.I felt the author could have tried explaining different other levers like trade and spread of religion and maybe drug crops! But these are nothing to take away from the already elaborate argument.Too detailed for a palatable non-fiction."

I’m not smarter than a hunter-gatherer from Namibia. My ipod and rechargeable roomba aren’t indicators or badges of any sort of superiority. It’s just that in the last 13,000 years, my ancestors were located in places with access to larger animals that could be domesticated and where food could be cultivated. They also slept with enough animals (perverts) to have developed a library of antibodies to combat life-threatening diseases. And much more recently, my parents immigrated to America. The overarching point of the book is nothing new to me. I agreed with its premise before I read the book. The details in the book, however, were overwhelming. I barely made it out of the hunter-gather-to-agriculture section with my sanity intact. Maybe it’s my self-centeredness that I try to apply every interesting truism from 13,000 years ago to my life now. For example, Diamond’s Anna Karenina principle as applied to classifying animals suitable for domestication led me to apply those six characteristics to myself. And upon doing so, I somehow came out of the analysis convinced that I needed to get a tattoo of a 1-yr old bear on my body. Very dense. Packed with interesting info. Writing is dry. Someone should make a board game out of this book."

And why some great civilizations rise and others fail. Why, when two very different cultures meet, who will win, and why; he who comes out on top will either absorb or destroy the other. About agriculture and the domestication of certain animals, and why each are so vital to a society's success. And where you come from and what the terrain, topography, climate and weather are like, all of which are key ingredients to which people will win and which will lose. Then throw in technology, which, without many exceptions, reads sort of like this: whoever's got the biggest guns (weapons) will win. And all of this with multiple historical examples. Now all or some of this may sound like 'common sense,' like yeah, so what? Isn't all this obvious? Nope, not really, esp. the animals part.

1250,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649009-sara,1,"Jared Diamond offers a lot of really credible, interesting data in Guns, Germs and Steel concerning the development of sedentary lifestyles, of plant and animal domestication and of the spread of humans around the globe. On one level, this is an interesting look at late human prehistory. On another level, historiographically-speaking, it is a really ham-handed work of unexamined teleological, anthropocentric history. I stopped reading it at the moment when the obnoxiousness of Diamond's rhetoric outweighed the interest of his facts. For example, he uses the words ""failed"" or ""failure"" more times than I cared to count when discussing why a certain crop or animal was never domesticated or why a group of people never developed food production (as opposed to hunting and gathering). A couple of examples of his questionable phrasing:""Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to emerge in Polynesia..."" Or further down that same page:""Given a few more millennia...perhaps Tonga and Hawaii would have reached the level of full-fledged empires..."" (66)(emphasis supplied in both quotes)Having read a mountain of historiographic thought, language like ""failed"" and ""reached the level"" (and so many other evaluative phrases Diamond uses with no self-reflection throughout) smacks of really old school, I mean ancient, hegemonic histories that are written to convey the obvious superiority of certain people or traditions over others. Finding this kind of language here is especially confusing given that Diamond is absolutely not trying to claim one people's superiority over another. In fact, he makes this a fundamental point; that the differing fates of human cultures around the world has been a function of their environments, not their inherent intelligence. That's fine, but instead of denigrating people, he uses this teleological language to imply the obvious goodness of the hegemony of humanity, in precisely the way it exists now, over the natural world.In Diamond's universe, all plants and animals are failing if they do not possess characteristics that allow them to be domesticated by humans. And all humans are not quite reaching a higher level (thought it's not their fault, he's quick to say), if they do not develop writing, give up their nomadic ways and settle down into sedentary communities, begin farming (or some form of food production), and immediately begin building increasingly complex, stratified communities that allow them to specialize and excel in warfare.If Diamond were purely describing how human domestication of biota, settlement, and class stratification happened to have occurred, none of this would bother me. But in almost every sentence there is the value judgment implied that all of this should have to come to pass. Moreover, he seems to be working his way toward some broad ""scientific"" theory of history, as though he has never heard of the Annales school or the longue durée. And I suspect he hasn't, which I guess is my real criticism. If you are going to write a work of history and include a ""new"" theory, you'd better educate yourself about what kinds of historical thought have come before. Historians already tried looking at large structures and patterns; they tried being more ""scientific"". Annales historians pulled the lens of history so far back that individual people pretty much disappeared. And it gave historians some good insight, but it also helped spur a new interest in history of the every man, history from below, and in microhistory. Which is to say, there are problems with pulling the lens that far back and historians learned about them decades ago. Things get lost. We need both kinds of history to get at anything that approximates human truth or reality. So thanks, Jared Diamond, you are contributing; but don't for a second think that your approach is new or revolutionary.Diamond's arrogance that historians were just waiting for a scientist to point out something they had been missing, that he could contribute an already-had thought to the field of history as though it had never been thought, demonstrates something all sorts of people assume about historians: that they are glorified novelists. I am the first to propound the fictive and literary aspects of history - they are inherent in the form - but this does not mean that trained historians do not perform important research and intellectual maneuvers that only come from a precise and in-depth mastery of certain sets of primary and secondary source material. I think history seems accessible to everyone, we all own it. This is right and good that it should seem this way. But why do so many people assume that historians do not actually know more about history than another kind of academic or intellectual? Jared Diamond has a fine and inquisitive mind, and he has studied broadly on many subjects, but he clearly does not know much about historical method or extant traditions of historical thought and, equally clearly, he did not believe it was worth exploring before writing this book. Because, you know, historians are just novelists who pretend they know something about the real world. Anybody can do this. It's not like they've pored over archives and read the real documentary muck left behind by centuries of human existence and then attempted to assemble this non-narrative muck into a readable format. They have not questioned in its minutest detail the puzzling relationship between the individual and vast marches of time. They have had no dialogue about whether their very discipline is, should be or could be more scientific. They certainly haven't given sincere and dedicated thought to what it means to try and say something ""true"" about the past. Nor do they have a very firm grasp on the problems inherent in even using language to speak about concrete events. To end my sarcastic mode, Diamond exemplifies beautifully the self-importance of scientists who have no time for the imprecision of actual lived human life. (As opposed to human life imagined as a collective.) Diamond acknowledges the ""idiosyncratic"" in individual human lives but, like the structural historians who precede him by many decades, he finds broader processes that function over longer periods of time more interesting than any process identifiable in the course of a single human life. Which is fine. He should pick the kind of history that is most meaningful to him, as should we all. He is foolish to assume this is the only kind of history possible or desirable.But I think, after all of this, perhaps language is the real rub. Something Diamond completely misunderstands about history as a discipline is that it functions by narration and to do it well, to do it really intelligently, you have to think philosophically about the fundamental tool you will be using: language. Diamond writes clearly and fairy well, but he treats the language he uses as though it were transparent. He has thought about a lot of things, but he apparently has not thought much at all about this primary communicative tool a historian must use, and must use with large amounts of self-consciousness. Decades of historical thinkers have demonstrated, to many people's everlasting annoyance, that language is a much more slippery, untrustworthy tool than writers like Diamond assume. He has no sensitivity to the reality and subtlety of philosophical problems inherent in the use of language and its use to make true statements about a dead, essentially unrecoverable past. Which is what makes his book interesting, but no great work of history. "
1251,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3682119-rei-avocado,1,"im nearly done with this book but im just going to call it now: i dont really like this book. i figured i should read it to check out what the hype is all about but then about halfway through all diamond's arguments you realize that hes really sticking with this geographical determinism thing.so first off let me talk about what i think this book succeeds in doing. jared diamond successfully dispels the idea that europeans are inherently better at building civilization because what really is civilization to begin with? and that certain sorts of intelligence are utterly useless for your living situation. when he was talking about his time with people in papua new guinea, i remembered that i have a coworker who is a great english teacher (a useful skill in many societies) who knows literally every single detail of every season ever aired of big brother brasil (an absolutely useless skill even in brazil). so like, fair. not that i needed convincing of this but im sure there are more than a few people who need to be reminded of this.diamond also excels at talking about anthropological history. frankly, if the book was just a study on how different regions developed across time, i would be fascinated. there is clearly a lot of care into making sure his point is understood and diamond refuses to leave a single stone unturned in that aspect.however.diamond undermines his entire argument because he starts off by explaining how no way of life is inherently superior to another, and that supposed civilization has its downsides compared to hunter gathering, but then asks why regions didnt develop into that supposedly not superior civilization to begin with. i have no idea why you would even bother writing this book. why would you say 'no way of life is better than another' and then write a book that basically says 'heres why the third world is still poor lol'. whats more is that at the very beginning of the book, diamond also points out that the reason regions succeed or fail has nothing to do with the racist 'cooler regions are just more cool-headed' notion. his entire book his devoted to pointing out how geography determined whether or not a region was able to 'succeed'. this book does not even follow its own internal logic!the book is nonfiction yet it has a framing device that i find particularly vile for the conclusions that he draws. a papua new guinean politician characterized in a pretty white mans burden simple minded childlike races sort of way asks why white men get to steal from black men and that apparently leads diamond on his journey to ask why colonialism existed. and to figure that out we need to go back to literally the dawn of homo sapiens itself? how is this not a sort of victim blaming? 'sorry you simpletons didnt develop quickly enough but im going to explain at least why that isnt the case, also you cant criticize me because i already said your way of life isnt worse than civilization so there!'so if a regions success isnt determined by race, according to diamond, what is? spoilers: diamond says its geography, as if that somehow makes it better. spoilers spoilers: its actually fucking imperialism and diamond pretends that doesnt exist and actually its all your fault for living in an area that didnt have the right goddamn grains or whatever!guns, germs, and steel trades biological determinism for geographical determinism, maintaining victorian social darwinism while denying that its actually doing it the whole time. diamond wants to be stephen jay gould so badly but only succeeds in making an absolute mockery of the readers intelligence, particularly if the reader is a colonized person! then again i suspect diamond never intended to write this book for his beloved fore friends in papua new guinea because i doubt he ever considered someone like that would be able to pick up a fucking book and read! he is the worst sort of liberal, a man who considers himself a voice for the oppressed while saying everything he can to justify why we are backwards savages in need of white men to protect us.you should gun, germ, and steal this fucking book."
1252,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Jared Diamond needs a better editor, a legion of fact-checkers, and someone to mercifully beat him to death with his own manuscript.Putting aside the Pulitzer for a moment, this man has a Ph.D in Biology (actually Physiology and Biophysics, but close enough), and he thinks llamas and alpacas are two breeds of the same species (they're actually in different genera) and that sea cucumbers are ""starfish relatives"" (which is as accurate as saying that sea squirts are human relatives, because they too are in the same phylum; it's technically correct, as all life is related, but not particularly meaningful), and apparently only has a passing acquaintance with the modern theory of evolution and recent work on human evolution.Outside of his purported field of speciality, he brings us such gems as kanji being ""Japan's predominant writing system"" and ""the kana syllabary"" only being used for ""telegrams, bank statements, and texts for blind readers"", it not having replaced kanji purely because of the prestige associated with kanji. He repeats the QWERTY myth, and seems to be under the impression that everyone typing in the Latin alphabet uses a QWERTY keyboard.It's fair enough for people not to know these things off-hand, but if you're writing a book, open a bloody encyclopedia once in awhile. The fact that it predated Wikipedia only buys you so much lenience.These things may seem like nitpicking, but the whole book is full of these ""facts"", and when he makes so many mistakes in the things I do know about, it doesn't do much for his credibility regarding the things I don't, which are presumably the whole reason to read the book in the first place. If a book requires that I have three additional books open at the same time just to make sure what he's saying isn't total crap, it just isn't a good book.His main theses also seem reasonably shaky and occasionally contradictory, and many of his digressions seem to be intended to distract from the fact that he doesn't actually have anything meaningful to say; he just hopes that by the end of the chapter, you'll have forgotten his opening points.If the overarching thesis of the book is that geographical difference have historically been a lot more significant than racial ones, as he suggests at the start of the book, well, that's solid and entirely uncontroversial, but also probably not worth writing a book about. If, however, it is that geographical differences have historically been the only significant factors, as he makes it appear near the end, then obviously four hundred pages of inaccuracies are a bad way to support that, and it leaves a host of phenomena unexplained. And it seems he found that out too, when he realised his pet hypothesis doesn't explain China (though ultimately he twisted a just-so story around it to fit anyway).Ultimately, though, the main thesis is less important, because this book is like many non-fiction Pulitzer-prize winners: a treasure trove of trivia to repeat half-rememberedly to your drunken hipster friends at cocktail parties. The accuracy of the information doesn't enter into it, because they aren't going to correct you anyway, and fuck the legitimate pursuit of knowledge, you just want to impress your friends.If you're that kind of person, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you care at all about scientific rigor, however, give it a miss."

For this book, here is such a sentence: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.'""This is a broad thesis, and the author has a lot of ground to cover. Go big or go home, eh? Diamond hopes to cover ALL peoples from ALL environments, and so he takes us from New Guinea to Spain to North America to China and everywhere in between, from 11,000 BC to 1972 (and up to 2003 if you read the afterword). If the traditional narrative of human history has been biased in favor of White Europeans, Diamond is deliberately biased in the opposite direction. He stresses early on that no group of people has any innate biological advantage over another, and does his best to keep the analysis of How We Got To This Point neutral and focused on differences in continental resource distribution.Maybe it's because I've come to this work nearly 20 years after publication and have already heard these main ideas summarized elsewhere but, in this reader's opinion, Diamond covers way too much. He bit off a huge mouthful, and now he wants to talk with you, and all the words are muffled and a little difficult to understand. But you listen because it's the polite thing to do and you do learn something, at least what little sticks from the huge volume of info coming your way. Check this paragraph out as an example, from the very first chapter:""That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever some scientist claims to have discovered 'the earliest X' -- whether X is the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere -- that announcement challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still earlier. In reality, there must be some truly 'earliest X,' with all claims of earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X, along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a consensus on such questions.""I get the feeling that, if I had tried to include that sort of writing in an undergrad history paper, the professor would quickly call BS and scribble something disapproving in the margins. I really wish Diamond had tightened up his editing and cut some of the wordier stuff down. But if you feel like reading 440 pages (if you read the afterword) of that nature, then you might enjoy yourself more than I did.2.5 of 5 stars. Informative but rambling and repetitive, and hardly as energetic or compelling as Diamond's other (shorter) books."

I love it when a book on my ""to-read"" list turns up there.Pretty engrossing so far, if not that original.Into it a bit now and the author's premise comes through clearly. One might call this an anti-racist book. His main point is to answer Yali's question: Why did this race/culture prevail over that race/culture. Big Hint! It's not because of racial differences. It's because of the varied rates of economic, technological, political development in different cultures in different parts of the world. The variation being caused by the relative abundance or scarcity of natural resources and the time available in a given area for development to take place. Makes sense to me, but then, I was an Anthro major! The author is(or was) an Anthro prof at UCLA.- The author states that Grizzlies can't be tamed, but it seems to me that that has been accomplished because they've been used in movies. Just sayin' ...- He gets his population numbers a bit confused when talking about the ""invasion"" of the new world by Europeans. He first says that there were 20 million NA's in Mexico at the time of(but just prior to) Cortez' invasion, and then he says the NA population of all of the America's was 20 million. The two numbers don't compute. I wonder which is correct?Just finished the chapter about the migrations of peoples and languages in south Asia and the Pacific and must say that the author miscalculated here in providing a much too dense, scholarly and academic detail-laden look at the issues of who went where and when. This, of course, is the part of the world most compelling to him. New Guinea is the focus of his scholarly and field work. Boring, confusing and over the top.The onslaught of scholarly research trivia continues and will result in this book's only getting a 3* rating. If I have to do a significant amount of skimming due to boredom that'll bring the old rating down. And ... there are several instances of conflicting statistics, as in the population of Hispaniola upon the arrival of Chris Columbus. Poor proof-reading ...Finished last night with this (IMHO)over-rated book. The basic point is pretty obvious these days isn't it? I think it's called geographic determinism in human cultural evolution. I don't personally know of any debate raging out there in academia(perhaps there is), but of course the know-nothings will continue to know nothing and there's not much can be done about it. The book had a promising beginning as it took a nice far-back perspective on things historical, human culture-wise, but then all the academic-linguistic-analysis stuff got rolled out and I got bored. The subject is worthy, but needs a better treatment. The ultimate wrap-up was fine and the author gives an extensive reading list arranged by chapter in lieu of a conventional biography.- A gentleman's ""c"" = 3* rated."

And of course there is a lot to be said for his approach to history especially zooming in on environmental issues: geography, climate and biology indeed had an incredible impact on the development of life and certainly also on human history. The evolutionary biologist Diamond is very right to put this into focus. His conclusions make sense, but ... he commits the classic mistake to present his approach as the only possible, logical, rational approach, or maybe the only really relevant approach. That he blatantly dismisses cultural factors is a pity. Okay, in his afterword he spends some brief attention to the importance of cultural factors, but he is getting rid of it by saying that there is little to say about them with certainty. A bit too cheap to my taste, Jared. Nevertheless, this is a very valuable work in the development of World History!Tip: also read 'Sapiens', by Yuval Hariri, (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) that builds on Diamond, but giving the culture sphere the place it deserves.

1256,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41267182-tariq-fadel,5,"we usually tend to think of the pharaohs and the Mesopotamian civilizations as belonging to an ancient time in the history of mankind. This is because before that writing wasn't invented and we know nothing about humanity's earlier times. But thanks to anthropology we can reasonably find information about our history. When you look at the course of humanity's existence on this planet you'll realize that the pharaohs were actually very modern since humans have existed long before that. One might think that before civilization and writing there were primitive ape like mammals who are our ancestors, but the truth is humans who are identical to us physically and mentally lived for hundreds of thousands of years as hunter gatherers long before agriculture was discovered. This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn the history of humanity and ultimately why humanity ended up being split to masters and slaves who are both human. It is also a very informative book. I learned that native Americans acquired horses after the Europeans arrived to America. That Arabic stems from an African language and that qwerty is not the fastest keyboard!"
1257,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222886-aasem-bakhshi,4,"Its 3.5 stars actually. It is terribly hard to imagine the scale of Jared Diamond's thesis and swim through it without a decent training in evolutionary biology (especially botany) and anthropology. I'd say that a layman like myself, at least, ended up getting the gist of Diamond's thesis and learnt a lot about stuff that I had no clue previously. But a fair exposure to history is enough to opine that Diamond should not probably have produced such a work for a common reader. To me, its condensation turned out to be its weakness. Diamond is himself aware that many of his important contentions seem no more than well considered and weighed contentions. The work lacks scholarly references and many of his primary assertions are absolutely redundant throughout the text. Therefore, the last five chapters which should otherwise have been the most interesting part of the book, seemed least assertive to me. But overall, an interesting and educating experience. "

The book loses pace at times, so I took a star from it. Other than that it is a great entertaining read about how our society and culture evolved, how nature, availability of food and life style contributed to the growths of nations and in the end be advantageous for the developed country. In short, if you ask the question, ""why some countries are developed and some are not?"" you need to read this book to find out how guns, germs and steel have provided an unfair advantages to some people."

1264,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
1265,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."
1266,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8298053-colleen-browne,5,"This is an important book. The research is outstanding and the author's commitment to his project undeniable. It is a book that everyone should read but might not want to. I am in grad school and have to read several books at a time. This was the book I chose for my light reading outside of class, lol. Diamond traces the origins of civilization from the Fertile Cresent to every corner of the world and his results are well researched, scholarly, and important. I did find however, that the book could be quite dry. The book is around 400 pages but it felt more like a book more than double that length. "
1267,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
1268,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
1269,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
1270,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
1271,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "
1272,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"This wonderful book will be remembered as one of the most important books of the 1990's, and perhaps, the entire 20th Century. Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "
1273,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84933770-fikayo-adebolajo,4,"A throughly engaging and enlightening read.With this offering, Jared Diamond sets about explaining the various rates of development and rise of human societies across the globe. Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."
1274,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,3,"Where to begin? Jared Diamond tackles the history of mankind on earth for the last 13,000 years. The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."
1275,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,4,"This was fascinating, at least to me. Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it. Recommended if you're ok with the cautions I mention above."

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book. Jared Diamond, while I like his theory, is too verbose for my tastes, and prattles on about things that could be covered with a quick summary. For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes. But he's going on about it for almost forty minutes.So, one day I'll read this. I like the theory -- even though I don't think it covers all the reasons why the Europeans came out on top -- just not my taste right now."

But man, am I glad to be finished. It was slow and dense, almost painfully so, and I can't really say that I enjoyed it. I'm glad to have read it because it did give me a good idea of why some societies were more successful than others in inventing technology, but I wish it had been a little less dense! "

1280,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53002487-coachjim,5,"Guns, Germs, and Steelby Jared DiamondThis is not light reading. The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
1281,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
1282,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
1283,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
1284,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
1285,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try 
Collapse
 next)."
1286,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,3,"An extended discussion of the factors that influence the development of human societies by way of answering the question of why certain societies – Europe – have socially and technologically dominated. And specifically by way of explaining Europe's dominance as an accident of environment – species availability, geography, that sort of thing – rather than anything inherent to its peoples or, just as often, anything inherently inferior about the native populations of the rest of the globe.Hmm. An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good. And then I start getting a feeling, just a niggle, like there's something I'm not seeing. And then it slowly dawns on me and I go, "". . . wait . . . wait, no. Really?""What I wasn't seeing here were proper citations. I assumed at first this was an artifact of the audiobook, since they maddeningly cut non-substantive footnotes. (I usually get an e-text to check later, if I am curious. Which I'm me, so I generally am.) But when I checked here, nope, almost nothing.But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."
1287,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest,4,"Why did the Europeans become the dominant force of colonization in the late 13th century? Why not the Incans, or the Chinese? Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."
1288,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"Very interesting and worthwhile -- won a Pulitzer. I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
1289,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "
1290,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138926-clint,3,"This book was three stars all the way through until I started reading the epilogue, which I thought was five stars, then I got to the second half of the epilogue, and it went back down to three. This is a really informative book, albeit a little dry. There is only so much information about corn and wheat that I can process on a given day. Most of the book was that, corn and wheat and cereal and grains and lots of other boring food words, and also a lot of linguistic stuff, which was pretty interesting, and some cool things about diseases (basically the reason you have such a kickass immune system is because your granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy slept with horses), but almost nothing about guns, which was what I was hoping to read. There is LOTS of repeating in this book, LOTS AND LOTS, and I think the epilogue (the first half, anyway) tells you much more succinctly what the first 400 or so pages said. And the book still barely answers the primary questions it started out with, mainly why has the whole world pretty much been run by Europeans (or Americans) for the last 500 years. Oddly, the book takes you right up until 500 years ago, then kind of runs out of steam right when it would be getting interesting. In the epilogue he timidly, slowly begins to touch on what to me seems really obvious, i.e. culture, but I guess in academia that's something you have to tip toe around. It's not at all hip or kosher to slam someone's culture, but culture has tons and tons to do with why and how a country functions the way it does. Give a certain group of people all the benefits in the world, but when corruption is accepted as a necessary part of society, when rabid nationalism and worship of anyone older than you is seen as the only way to not be an asshole, and when any new idea is seen as ridiculous strictly because it's new, you're going to have problems. Another thing that kind of irked me about this book was the continual use of putting certain phrases in quotation marks, like the ""discovery"" of the New World. Yeah, dork, I get it, no one really ""discovered"" the New World after 10,000 years ago, but I'm not a 10 year old brainwashed student, I get it. Another funny thing was he kept calling it a racist viewpoint to hold that white Europeans were so powerful because of a genetic superiority (and I would also think it's kind of racist), but then he turns around and says, in his opinion, New Guineans are on average more intelligent than Europeans. Typical guilty white liberal. So it's racist to say Europeans are smarter than other people, but not racist, I guess, to say New Guineans are smarter than other people? This kind of skyscraper-sized inconsistency is what drives me up the fucking wall when reading these kinds of books, and makes me feel there will never be any real progress in the social sciences because everyone's so sensitive about what they should or shouldn't say. "
1291,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983551-neil-pearson,3,"I've known of this book for a long time and have even seen a documentary based on it so I finally took the plunge. I really like the central idea that the environment has shaped human societies (for better or worse) and that there isn't an intrinsic difference between people's of different environements - we're all suited to get the most out of our particular niches. I also understand the cascade effect of domesticating plants and animals. My issue with the book is that Diamond takes a far too deterministic view and makes individuals/groups to be mere passengers in the sweep of environmental history and I think that's too simplistic. While history may play out similarly based on the axis of the Earth I don't think it would play out exactly the same because there are simply too many variables. I did enjoy the discussion on plant and animal domestication though and the link with disease was fascinating. There's another fun snippet of linguistics as a historical tool (which is expanded upon in ""the third chimpanzee"") and the discussion on geographical barriers is interesting.I didn't enjoy his reductionist view on inventions and the idea they just happen along with the head-scratching claim that most ideas are acquired from other places (but they still have to come from somewhere!). He also has the habit of being a tiny bit apologetic when it comes to western society (in the sense they were lucky as opposed to justifying their actions) which I suspect is a knee-jerk reaction to all the imperialist works suggesting it's because Europeans were better than the ""savages"" but I think it would have been best to stick with the idea it's the environment that's shaped societies (although it's always going to be difficult to separate a leader's views from their environment). Diamond also skims over religion yet again which I always find frustrating but there is at least a brief discussion of its role in societies and how it can be used as a justification/tool in colonisation.The epilogue is very good at addressing a lot of my issues with some of his claims and convenient omissions throughout the book. The problem is that by that point I was already frustrated with some of the things he'd said (or hadn't) and that jaded my view of most of his claims in the main text. I'd certainly recommend new readers to skip to the epilogue after the introduction before reading the meat of the book as I know I'd have enjoyed it far more knowing he'd taken these other interpretations into consideration.Another fun thought I started to have towards the end of the book was that Yali might have wished he'd never asked Jared the cargo question if he'd had to listen to an 11 hour answer.It's still a great book for getting you to alter the way you look at things and I think it's something fantasy authors should look at when drawing their world maps too (I know I can't help but wonder where their fertile crescents are)!"

I found half the book almost entirely repetition and the latter bit on languages complexly boring and a hassle to follow. Every other page there would be a half page digression restating a dozen things already stated. It was a neat read. BUT I felt empiricism was a bit lacking at times. while much of the book is convincing, much of it is also the authors OWN opinions based on correlations/causations/inference style arguments to justify his ideas, some of which diverge from generally accepted ones. He has a tendency to infer and correlate and then peat himself so much so that by the time I finished the book I was cursing it.I was expecting something vastly different. this entire book is about food production and geographic inhibitions of it, which consequently benefit Eurasia while be disadvantageous to other places such as Australia. It has a very unempirical feel to it. The author himself even mentions people will disagree with his methodology and tries to back it up by calling sciences like Astronomy, historical science rather than actual science. The epilogue made me really dislike the author for his assumptions about some sciences not being sciences like astronomy. He claims you cant test anything and so, basically, he is saying his interred theories should be valid.. because as he sees it, Astronomy isn't scientific in that you cant test it. Just... wow... He also dismissed individual geniuses like Einstein... shrugging them all off... claiming that they were basically just lucky to be the ones that and the final touches on some innovation. The author, thus, comes off as very narcissistic and self absorbed in his own intellect. whether he is or not, I don't know, but the epilogue certainly suggested it.The first half was great. As I got maybe 60-70% through I grew weary and tired of his line of logic. I had hoped this were to be more factual based, than hypothetical. It felt as though I were reading someones PHD thesis by the end. He also has this irritating habit of mixing up the words is and are, making some sentences read oddly.I may seem vexed and I am. This book could have been a fraction of the size it was. I felt cheated by being forced to read so much repetition (yup, i am repeating this complaint again). I may not have picked this book up had I known what lie past the half way mark. Alas, I hate to leave a book unfinished, and it was interesting at times. I feel as though good chunks must be taken with a grain of salt. There are facts thrown in here and there however, I was expecting more of an actual history of civilizations/empires themselves, not so much a discourse on food production. Its an alright book at points, but could be better."
1294,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290837-ken,5,"Guns, Germs, and Steel (GGS) is an illuminating and sweeping panorama of human history. It is thought-provoking, logical, and debunks racist theories by highlighting the undeniable significance of geographic and climatic influences on the developments and progressions of human societies. For example, civilization and technology spread fastest throughout the Eurasian continent partly due its vast width and its east-west latitudinal axis, which allows for a fairly consistent temperate climate and a quicker spread of food production. Food production leads to societal/political organization and specialization of labor. This yields more leisure time to the educated elites, allowing them to cogitate, innovate, and develop world-changing technologies like gunpowder, the printing press, and the steam engine. The second largest continents, Africa and the Americas are narrower in width and have a north-south axis. This makes it more difficult for food production and peoples to spread since they have to transgress climatic hurdles (certain foods only grow at certain elevations and latitudes) such as the Sahara Desert and the Isthmus of Panama. Secondly, Africa and the Americas had fewer native, domesticable animals. Eurasia had horses, dogs, goats, cows, and sheep while North America and Africa had the less effective camels, llamas, and alpacas. Horses aided Eurasians in warfare, dogs in hunting, and goats, cows, and sheep on the farm in food production. You might be wondering- what about the vast animal diversity in Africa? Well, Africa’s zebra (the horse’s closest equivalent) is finicky, fearful, unaccommodating, and to this day has still not been domesticated. We all know how the various feline species (lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) are less submissive than dogs and therefore less domesticable. In its title GGS explains how the proximate factors of guns, germs, and steel enabled Europeans to first sail to the Americas and conquer the Native Americans and not the other way around. The ultimate factors that explain why the Europeans first came to possess guns, germs, and steel are due to their head start in food production and availability and use of domesticable animals (from which they derived many of the germs that would later wipe out the Native Americans). Eurasia also had more diverse plants available to begin and sustain food production. This book is a beast to get through (especially when reading about plants), but the sense of satisfaction and illumination obtained after conquering the beast and becoming more understanding of why societies developed at different rates is well worth it. Well done, Diamond. "
1295,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33430802-hailey,2,"I will be the first to say that I am not a huge non-fiction person. However, my eyes were opened to the genre over the summer when I read a phenomenal, fast-paced non-fiction novel for my AP Biology class, The Demon in the Freezer. This was no Demon in the Freezer.For starters, barely 30 pages into the book, the first red flag popped up. Jared Diamond is not a historian. Nor is he an anthropologist. Rather, he is an evolutionary biologist. So, okay. There's a slight connection. But still, I felt that it called into question his expertise on the topic. I found Diamond's writing to be terribly dry. Granted, history is, to me, not exactly the world's most exciting topic, but surely it could have been less bland. Maybe a joke or two? A pun? Something to keep the reader engaged? I didn't care much about the vast majority of the topics. Only a few really interested me, which I acknowledged was not the book's fault. But it was mighty difficult to trudge through each boring chapter. My only salvation was that each chapter was broken up into little mini passages, so I could give myself rewards for finishing a single passage. You think I'm kidding? Ask Alex.Another thing that saved this book from a DNF? The pictures. They were frequent enough for me to look forward to them and get excited whenever one popped up. It meant I didn't have to read a page! But the one strange thing about the pictures was that there were two twenty-page (each!) sections of the book that were simply photographic portraits of different people. There was not even a single mention of these photographs until the epilogue of the book, so I was like ""what is going on"" whenever one of these sections popped up literally in the middle of a sentence.The final gripe I have with the book was one section of a chapter in which Diamond did not write anything. Well, he quoted. He quoted for an entire chapter. Basically, it went down like this:""so, the invasion of the Incas by the Spanish was pretty bad but I don't really feel like explaining it to you, so here's a couple primary sources""Thanks??? The only reason this book deserves two stars is that at least some of the content is interesting. And, I must admit that I did learn something at the end, which is the point of a non-fiction novel.Overall, this just wasn't the book for me. It was terribly dense, bland, and boring, and had me watching the page count like a hawk, just waiting for page 431 to pop up. "
1296,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837466-dree,3,"This book is full of interesting ideas. What it is not full of is citations. Actually, there are NO citations. No footnotes, no endnotes, just the dreaded ""further reading"" sections in the back. Am I the only one that hates that? I doubt it.As I began reading I was flagging pages I had questions about. So many pages were flagged a gave up. This would be a GREAT book for discussion--in class, or in a book group. Me? I am arguing with myself and looking things up on Wikipedia. Not ideal.So...Diamond never defines ""agriculture"" or ""domestication"" to my satisfaction. Nor (obviously) does he give a source for a standard archeological or anthropological definition of either. Yet I kept wondering, through the entire book, where he was drawing lines. Native Australian canals for eel raising/harvesting is not domestication, not is it agriculture. So what is it? How does it not ""count""? I know the author has studied a lot in New Guinea. He talks about it. A lot. Yet India is virtually invisible in this book (except for the Chinese, Austronesians, and Europeans that traded there). Why? Why not a tidbit about Japan?Anything else you ask? Why yes. The author's tone is somewhat condescending, there is too much first person for my taste (""I think it is obvious"" ""When I was in New Guinea""), too many determinedly wobbly statements (such as ""make this inference virtually certain"" (348) and ""I would guess"" (349)), and way way WAY too much speculation (""What if Hitler had died in 1930?"" ""What if the Inca had..."" what if what if what if). There are also many statements like ""Protein starvation is probably also the ultimate reason why cannibalism was widespread in traditional New Guinea highland societies."" (p149). Really? Citation(s)? Please pretty please? That's a huge statement to stick a ""probably"" in the middle of, with no backup.So...what do I think? I don't know what to think. The book is interesting, if annoying. But without citations I really can't form a true opinion. I don't think Diamond has invented a new discipline ""Historical Science"" as he seems to think he has (epilogue). I would argue this book isn't a history book at all, it's geography, or anthropology. It's historical, yes, but it's not history.And I think it's a bit of a ripoff of Alfred Crosby. Whom Diamond mentions, but I don't think he gives him the credit he deserves."

1298,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7955372-ian-tymms,5,"One of those books you wonder how you missed. Getting on for 20 years old now but its basic thesis - that geography not genes is the determining factor as to why the Old World dominates the New - still struck me as clear, thoughtful and powerfully argued. The detail and complexity of what Diamond had to say was both compelling and surprisingly readable; I read every one of the 440 pages and a few of the endnotes to boot. One small quibble: in the 2003 afterward, Diamond discusses some of the implications raised by his final reflection in regards to the organisation of groups of people and the role of leadership in history. Specifically, he discusses conversations with the likes of Bill Gates about how best to organise teams in business. Whilst the conclusions of these reflections may be reasonable (they seemed so to me), they seemed to miss what I take to be the main point of the book: it is the geographical circumstances of humanities history which has been most clearly deterministic rather than specific human cultural or behavioural characteristics. The corollary of this observation in business would seem to me to have much more to do with the kind of industry and its location than with the behaviour of CEOs and employees. I would have thought Diamond's considerable insights might be more powerfully directed towards reflecting on where, when and how industries are located and the consequent implications for their success. This kind of reflection seems to me to fit more appropriately with the ""scientific"" approach he so consciously devotes to his approach in the bulk of ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"".Regardless, this is a powerful, brilliant book which has shaped and coloured my thinking and filled in some important holes in my understanding of the parts of the world where I live. I'm off to write a post on my blog about the Boonwurrung, the people whose culture and land my ancestors destroyed with their guns, germs and steel."
1299,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57132772-lin,2,"Full disclosure: I am writing this in one unpremeditated, unedited go, mostly on the adrenaline of deep frustration.It is baffling to me how dismissive—almost disdainful—Diamond is of the Chinese writing system throughout, with a level of unqualified criticism uncharacteristic of the rest of the book. “For example,” Diamond writes, “the prestige value of Chinese culture is still so great in Japan and Korea that Japan has no thought of discarding its Chinese-derived writing system despite its drawbacks for representing Japanese speech, while Korea is only now replacing its clumsy Chinese-derived writing with its wonderful indigenous hangul alphabet.” Is this what so-called objective “scientific writing” looks like? I don’t know who Diamond’s supposed Japanese and Korean friends are (he cites these nebulous figures once, with the affectation of one claiming “My black friends don’t ask me to say African-American”), but as a native Chinese speaker who did not learn the language through Diamond’s expressly preferred, Latin alphabet-based pinyin, as well as a Japanese speaker, I call Massive Bullshit on his unfounded, unprofessional condemnation.This is compounded with an additional 2003 chapter on Japan and Korea whose “guys, you’re ‘twin brothers,’ why don’t you make peace for the progress of humanity” policy recommendation I found condescending.I understand that these only make up a small percentage of what is an ambitious, expansive, painstakingly detailed cross-disciplinary work, but it was enough to deeply bother and distract at least one reader. I also find that, in the wake of Yuval Noah Harari’s bestsellers and the rise of scholarly podcasts, Diamond’s fact-dumping narrative voice is startlingly humorless, sometimes to the point of somnambulant. Having been told for almost a decade that this is a seminal work I must read to understand the world, this fell short of expectations—to say the least."
1300,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4699853-dara-salley,4,"I was less astounded by “Guns, Germs and Steel” than I might otherwise have been, partly due to the success of the book. Diamonds ideas are simple and persuasive. I’m sure that when they were first expounded in the 1997 that they created quite a stir. In the past two decades they have become part of the mainstream. I’m not sure when or where, but somehow I’ve heard almost all his arguments before. They’re part of my psyche. Reading Diamond’s book was less of a revelation for me and more like learning the details of something I already know.“Guns Germs and Steel” is about as thrilling as a book full of facts can be. It’s like attending a very interesting anthropology lecture; it’s work, but fun work. There were some moments when I zoned out a little. I felt that Diamond provided too many examples, but this complaint probably relates to what I said earlier. I came to this book already informed of Diamond’s thesis and halfway convinced. This made all the arguments somewhat superfluous for me.It’s a very intellectually satisfying book. Any mildly empathetic person will look at the inequities of the world feel frustrated. We want an answer that explains why terrible things happen to innocent people. Some find the answer in religion and the unknowable nature of God. If that isn’t a good enough answer for you, Diamond’s book will help fill in the gaps. He draws lines from climate and geography to colonialism, providing, if not a solution, at least and explanation for all the pain in the third world. I’m not saying that his arguments are 100% correct, but they will make you feel a little closer to finding order in a chaotic world."
1301,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4," Jared Diamond’s Pulitzer Prize winning book about how and why civilization emerged the way they did was very introspective and engaging. He is a biologist who lived in New Guinea. He came to appreciate the native people there and one in particular, Yani asked him why westerners had so much relative to the natives on New Guinea. He explored the reasons for why civilizations emerged as they did.Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture and written language in an interesting way. His explanation on the advantages of East-West orientation between Europe and Asia over North-South orientations of Africa and the Americas helped to explain why some areas dominated over others. Having navigable river systems instead of mountains and deserts helped spread the domestication of farming and the domestication of animals. Therefore, the emergence of farming flourished more in some areas, Eurasia, over others. All animals in nature could not be domesticated and used for farming like some of the big animals in Africa.Guns were a force in dominating some societies and the materials necessary are not found everywhere on our planet. He discussed the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by urban dwellers, and the harm caused to these urban dwellers who came in contact with the people who lacked these immunities. Steel was used for the making of weaponry and machinery so became prominent in later years. Diamonds explanations were cohesive and understandable. It is essential reading for anyone interested in reading how civilizations emerged."

It took me weeks to read, as I moved forward/backward a lot to get a better understanding and to become familiar with the details. Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is the macro history of human societies. This book is based on solid research and written as a text book--an introduction followed by well-organized chapters, each chapter contains detailed descriptions, a conclusion that summarizes the main points made in the book, ended with an epilogue where future enhancements and competing theories are briefly discussed.Geographical environment, including flora and fauna, shaped the early development of human societies. Its ripple effect is still felt today. There are lot of great, very interesting points. One of them is the comparison between the three regions of the old world: The Fertile Crescent, Europe and China. Was The Fertile Crescent the first region in the world where the environment made inhabitable by the inhabitants? China's early unity, a result of its environment, shaped China into a technological and social advanced country. However, from 15th century onwards, the same unity became a negative force and caused China to lag behind.Again, the book is the macro history, the board sketches of the past 11000 years of human life, not the micro history or the role of random events in the course of history. A full 5-star non-fiction."
1303,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964113-rise,4,"Amusing to read the slew of negative reviews in Amazon. It's hardly surprising though, given the subject matter of the book and its revolutionary approach to the interpretation of history. Prof. Diamond presents his case well that I think some of the debated quotes in the reviews were taken out of context, or were taken as absolutes. I can imagine why some arguments are controversial. They're not always ""politically correct"" and often run against conventional knowledge. Prof. Diamond is talking about the origin of ""races,"" why some are more affluent than others and why some are not destined to prosper. His central argument is quite basic: environment, not race, is the main determinant of success of societies. Very humane and obvious but still debatable. What is impressive is the wealth of evidence presented and the manner in which they are analyzed. The environmental approach to history can run the risk of the ""comprehensive syndrome,"" i.e., too detailed and sweeping and long, that it sometimes reads like a chore. I read it on and off for almost a year. It was like attending a course in ecology. On the strength of this book, I'd likely attend more lectures by Prof. Diamond through his other books."
1304,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17754981-stephen-yoder,4,"I had many ""whoa"" moments while reading this book. I had never realized that corn took so long to travel from the highlands of current Mexico to areas of the current USA. Once I got Diamond's point that many Eurasian epidemics have their roots in the diseases that strike domesticated animals of Eurasia I definitely smacked my own forehead. Wow. Using comparative linguistics to determine which people ate which plant or animal first is amazing. Food production, geography, environmental factors, domesticable animals, natural resources -- all of these things have greatly influenced the ebb and flow power from one region's peoples to another, and back again. Race, however, has not been a determinative factor. It is important to read books like this today when various groups express racist narratives about entire nations of people -- ""They don't send their best people"" or ""shithole countries.""Diamond's sense of humor and humility are steady currents underlying the entire book. He prefaces some sections with statements like, ""This chart will horrify academic experts in this field. . . but I generalize for a reason."" The story about the bedside interpreting at a hospital gone wrong is not one to be forgotten (hysterical!).I highly recommend this book. "
1305,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12486689-betty-ho,4,"The one sentence to summarize this book is ""history followed different courses for different people because of differences of the environment, not of biological differences among people themselves."" The logic behind is fairly straightforward - weather/ landscape affects wild plants/ animals availability for domestication which in turn affects the chance of food production and thus gems, technology, writing and eventually politics. Therefore, the reason you were born in a developed country and are more educated and wealthier is because your ancestors were lucky enough to be born in certain part of the world, NOT because your are smarter nor your gene is better than the rest of the world.I like the way how the author elaborates his logic. He uses tons of historical examples plus archeology discoveries - a perfect marriage between history and science. Although the empire of climate can only explain first half of the world history (probably until the time of medieval as the courses of modern history are far too complex to be explained only by environmental factors), this book has already provided answers to many many questions.    "
1306,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5936947-sean-chick,4,"Diamond's synthesis argues for geography not as the sole decider in human affairs but certainly as the main one. Any work of this sweep is going to have holes in its particulars, but Diamond is overall very persuasive. Yet, there is one serious failing that I detected: his discussion of technology. Diamond wants to reject the racial explanation for why whites came to dominate the world. In this he is right, but he goes too far. European technological superiority came in the main from the scientific revolution. This in large part explains why Europe became the center of world power. While Diamond is right that geography formed the basis for that revolution, there was something deeper happening in Europe that allowed for the swiftest technological revolution in history. And while the ""Great Man"" view of history is certainly false, it has its uses. Diamond, at least in his thoughtful conclusion acknowledges that. It is the great strength of the book; he makes a good argument but is no brute reductionist. Nuance is welcome.Last thing: the pictures in the book are the most bafflingly useless I have ever seen in a major work."

If only I could throw hardbound copies of this book (weight: 2.1 lbs) at the faces of people going around distorting history. It presents a fascinating take on the evolution of human societies and manages to answer very fundamental and difficult questions in a clear and objective manner through the combined lens of geography, biology, linguistics and economics. One of the biggest statement the book makes is to show how strongly environmental quirks outside their control affect the trajectories of the societies living in it. I expected the book to be quite similar to Sapiens by Yuval Harari but they are very different books. I remember Yuval being a lot more personal with his narrative. Also, Jared is a lot more detailed in his materialistic comparison of different societies. I would have liked more information on how the Indian Subcontinent was populated. It does not find much mention. But stating that is not to deny the wealth of information that this book already offers.Published in 1997, it is 20 years old today but still highly recommended! "
1308,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,As a scientific book it fails overall.Pro:Diamond seems very sympathetic towards all people and cultures. He also knows a lot about different ways the societies collect food and in what environment they live in. Things he probably has learned from studying birds.Con:This is how not to do science. Most of his great conclusions are loosely based on the findings he picks out to support his ready made conclusions. Nothing is proved or disproved in any way in this book. And he completely ignores genetics and biology even though he talks about people who have adapted to different environments. Sure one group can have been adapted to an environment where there were fewer things to plant and fewer animals to tame. But how did that influence people's genetics? Because it must have done. Everything does. Where do we stand? This book was boring and not informative. It's basically a collection of facts mixed in with random opinions/assumptions. But I still like him and he seems sympathetic as a person.

I listened to the abridged audio (I hadn't realized it was abridged until I checked it out of the library, but decided to give it a shot, anyway). I'm not sure if some of the stuff that I think I missed (phrases that ""suddenly"" appeared without a definition, etc) was because I was not paying attention momentarily, or if it was something that was cut out of the book for the abridgment. I don't know if it would have made a difference if the version I had was unabridged, but the book was only o.k. for me. Somewhat interesting, but probably nothing I'll remember for any amount of time. I will probably still try another book by Diamond, however. "

Well organized, well explained, I felt like I learned so much, AND I want to keep learning more about human history and geography. In fact, now I wonder if I should've studied archaeology?

Then, you have to admire that he somehow successfully drew it all together.The book is dense with information, all there to bolster his argument that geography matters a ton (or as summarised at book club, life is about shit dumb luck).I really liked the study of Polynesia as a microcosm of his theory.If there were crtitiques it'd be that it gets a bit repetitive by the end, and that he's so focussed on his theory he maybe doesn't consider other aspects of humanity (in that sense Sapiens makes an excellent companion volume).Definitely worth a future re-read and note-taking."

Also taken into account is that germs develop very differently with diffferent population densities, and more food requires more and better storage techniques and leads to development of beauracracy as well as expansionist tendencies which become more aggresssive with higher population density.6 August, 12017 HE(the Holocene Calendar)"

Guns, Germs and Steel should've been the start of that journey. If I knew better I would have read this book first and Sapiens after. The two complement each other almost perfectly.Guns, Germs and Steel focuses on the geographic and ecological impact of human development. It was very clear from start that Jared Diamond was fully aware of the limitations of historians to develop the equivalent of a scientific theory and that he made those limitations the strength of this book.I found the last part unnecessary. It functions as the demonstration of the theory, somewhat similar to the predictive properties of a scientific theory but in hindsight. However I felt it added nothing. The epilogue on the other hand is brilliant and fully justifies this last part."

I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the author's beautiful analysis using a very well-constructed framework that is highly nuanced and manages to rigorously explain the broad trends of history in simple language.

The Epilogue is in itself worth reading in order to appreciate the author's wish to develop a historical science that is inter-disciplinary and follows a rigorous methodology based on natural experiments rather than approaching history through preconceived ideological frameworks."

I'd say it's a must read just for the excellent geography lesson in every chapter. But the length it goes to in explaining the domestication of plants and animals over time is wonderful as well. Additionally, the language study is quite informative. Just a book full of marvels. "
1317,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472341-kislay,4,"This book reads like a textbook or a coursebook. I have read 3 books now which are similar in themes. ""Why nations fail"", "" Sapiens:A brief history of humankind"" and ""Guns,Germs and Steel"". Of these 3, Sapiens is more fun. I will highly recommend that one. After reading sapiens, if you want to explore more, GGS is your pick. And if you want to delve more into the politcal aspects of history, ""why nations fail"" should be in your hand. Nevertheless, it is a good book."

But like Freak-anomics, it blurs the line between causal relations and coincindental relations for his conclusions.It was a very interesting read, but as I look back on it now it seems less conclusive and more academic porn of sorts masquerading as academic research. This sentiment is echoed by many others as well.Good book and writing, but the less-than-conclusive conculsions leave much to be desired. That knocks it down to a 2-star"
1319,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/197436-kenghis-khan,5,"I find it utterly unbelievable that this book gets anything less than five stars. Diamond can't state his elegant case strongly enough. This book changed the way I look at history, and nobody but the most die-hard racists can come away from it without having a thoroughly new outlook on the way the world is. Five stars way up."
1320,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138926-clint,3,"This book was three stars all the way through until I started reading the epilogue, which I thought was five stars, then I got to the second half of the epilogue, and it went back down to three. This is a really informative book, albeit a little dry. There is only so much information about corn and wheat that I can process on a given day. Most of the book was that, corn and wheat and cereal and grains and lots of other boring food words, and also a lot of linguistic stuff, which was pretty interesting, and some cool things about diseases (basically the reason you have such a kickass immune system is because your granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy slept with horses), but almost nothing about guns, which was what I was hoping to read. There is LOTS of repeating in this book, LOTS AND LOTS, and I think the epilogue (the first half, anyway) tells you much more succinctly what the first 400 or so pages said. And the book still barely answers the primary questions it started out with, mainly why has the whole world pretty much been run by Europeans (or Americans) for the last 500 years. Oddly, the book takes you right up until 500 years ago, then kind of runs out of steam right when it would be getting interesting. In the epilogue he timidly, slowly begins to touch on what to me seems really obvious, i.e. culture, but I guess in academia that's something you have to tip toe around. It's not at all hip or kosher to slam someone's culture, but culture has tons and tons to do with why and how a country functions the way it does. Give a certain group of people all the benefits in the world, but when corruption is accepted as a necessary part of society, when rabid nationalism and worship of anyone older than you is seen as the only way to not be an asshole, and when any new idea is seen as ridiculous strictly because it's new, you're going to have problems. Another thing that kind of irked me about this book was the continual use of putting certain phrases in quotation marks, like the ""discovery"" of the New World. Yeah, dork, I get it, no one really ""discovered"" the New World after 10,000 years ago, but I'm not a 10 year old brainwashed student, I get it. Another funny thing was he kept calling it a racist viewpoint to hold that white Europeans were so powerful because of a genetic superiority (and I would also think it's kind of racist), but then he turns around and says, in his opinion, New Guineans are on average more intelligent than Europeans. Typical guilty white liberal. So it's racist to say Europeans are smarter than other people, but not racist, I guess, to say New Guineans are smarter than other people? This kind of skyscraper-sized inconsistency is what drives me up the fucking wall when reading these kinds of books, and makes me feel there will never be any real progress in the social sciences because everyone's so sensitive about what they should or shouldn't say.

1321,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983551-neil-pearson,3,"I've known of this book for a long time and have even seen a documentary based on it so I finally took the plunge. I really like the central idea that the environment has shaped human societies (for better or worse) and that there isn't an intrinsic difference between people's of different environements - we're all suited to get the most out of our particular niches. I also understand the cascade effect of domesticating plants and animals. My issue with the book is that Diamond takes a far too deterministic view and makes individuals/groups to be mere passengers in the sweep of environmental history and I think that's too simplistic. While history may play out similarly based on the axis of the Earth I don't think it would play out exactly the same because there are simply too many variables. I did enjoy the discussion on plant and animal domestication though and the link with disease was fascinating. There's another fun snippet of linguistics as a historical tool (which is expanded upon in ""the third chimpanzee"") and the discussion on geographical barriers is interesting.I didn't enjoy his reductionist view on inventions and the idea they just happen along with the head-scratching claim that most ideas are acquired from other places (but they still have to come from somewhere!). He also has the habit of being a tiny bit apologetic when it comes to western society (in the sense they were lucky as opposed to justifying their actions) which I suspect is a knee-jerk reaction to all the imperialist works suggesting it's because Europeans were better than the ""savages"" but I think it would have been best to stick with the idea it's the environment that's shaped societies (although it's always going to be difficult to separate a leader's views from their environment). Diamond also skims over religion yet again which I always find frustrating but there is at least a brief discussion of its role in societies and how it can be used as a justification/tool in colonisation.The epilogue is very good at addressing a lot of my issues with some of his claims and convenient omissions throughout the book. The problem is that by that point I was already frustrated with some of the things he'd said (or hadn't) and that jaded my view of most of his claims in the main text. I'd certainly recommend new readers to skip to the epilogue after the introduction before reading the meat of the book as I know I'd have enjoyed it far more knowing he'd taken these other interpretations into consideration.Another fun thought I started to have towards the end of the book was that Yali might have wished he'd never asked Jared the cargo question if he'd had to listen to an 11 hour answer.It's still a great book for getting you to alter the way you look at things and I think it's something fantasy authors should look at when drawing their world maps too (I know I can't help but wonder where their fertile crescents are)!"

1323,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39746437-jonraven,3,"I really enjoyed this... for a while... until grew to dislike this after the first half. I found half the book almost entirely repetition and the latter bit on languages complexly boring and a hassle to follow. Every other page there would be a half page digression restating a dozen things already stated. It was a neat read. BUT I felt empiricism was a bit lacking at times. while much of the book is convincing, much of it is also the authors OWN opinions based on correlations/causations/inference style arguments to justify his ideas, some of which diverge from generally accepted ones. He has a tendency to infer and correlate and then peat himself so much so that by the time I finished the book I was cursing it.I was expecting something vastly different. this entire book is about food production and geographic inhibitions of it, which consequently benefit Eurasia while be disadvantageous to other places such as Australia. It has a very unempirical feel to it. The author himself even mentions people will disagree with his methodology and tries to back it up by calling sciences like Astronomy, historical science rather than actual science. The epilogue made me really dislike the author for his assumptions about some sciences not being sciences like astronomy. He claims you cant test anything and so, basically, he is saying his interred theories should be valid.. because as he sees it, Astronomy isn't scientific in that you cant test it. Just... wow... He also dismissed individual geniuses like Einstein... shrugging them all off... claiming that they were basically just lucky to be the ones that and the final touches on some innovation. The author, thus, comes off as very narcissistic and self absorbed in his own intellect. whether he is or not, I don't know, but the epilogue certainly suggested it.The first half was great. As I got maybe 60-70% through I grew weary and tired of his line of logic. I had hoped this were to be more factual based, than hypothetical. It felt as though I were reading someones PHD thesis by the end. He also has this irritating habit of mixing up the words is and are, making some sentences read oddly.I may seem vexed and I am. This book could have been a fraction of the size it was. I felt cheated by being forced to read so much repetition (yup, i am repeating this complaint again). I may not have picked this book up had I known what lie past the half way mark. Alas, I hate to leave a book unfinished, and it was interesting at times. I feel as though good chunks must be taken with a grain of salt. There are facts thrown in here and there however, I was expecting more of an actual history of civilizations/empires themselves, not so much a discourse on food production. Its an alright book at points, but could be better."
1324,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290837-ken,5,"Guns, Germs, and Steel (GGS) is an illuminating and sweeping panorama of human history. It is thought-provoking, logical, and debunks racist theories by highlighting the undeniable significance of geographic and climatic influences on the developments and progressions of human societies. For example, civilization and technology spread fastest throughout the Eurasian continent partly due its vast width and its east-west latitudinal axis, which allows for a fairly consistent temperate climate and a quicker spread of food production. Food production leads to societal/political organization and specialization of labor. This yields more leisure time to the educated elites, allowing them to cogitate, innovate, and develop world-changing technologies like gunpowder, the printing press, and the steam engine. The second largest continents, Africa and the Americas are narrower in width and have a north-south axis. This makes it more difficult for food production and peoples to spread since they have to transgress climatic hurdles (certain foods only grow at certain elevations and latitudes) such as the Sahara Desert and the Isthmus of Panama. Secondly, Africa and the Americas had fewer native, domesticable animals. Eurasia had horses, dogs, goats, cows, and sheep while North America and Africa had the less effective camels, llamas, and alpacas. Horses aided Eurasians in warfare, dogs in hunting, and goats, cows, and sheep on the farm in food production. You might be wondering- what about the vast animal diversity in Africa? Well, Africa’s zebra (the horse’s closest equivalent) is finicky, fearful, unaccommodating, and to this day has still not been domesticated. We all know how the various feline species (lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) are less submissive than dogs and therefore less domesticable. In its title GGS explains how the proximate factors of guns, germs, and steel enabled Europeans to first sail to the Americas and conquer the Native Americans and not the other way around. The ultimate factors that explain why the Europeans first came to possess guns, germs, and steel are due to their head start in food production and availability and use of domesticable animals (from which they derived many of the germs that would later wipe out the Native Americans). Eurasia also had more diverse plants available to begin and sustain food production. This book is a beast to get through (especially when reading about plants), but the sense of satisfaction and illumination obtained after conquering the beast and becoming more understanding of why societies developed at different rates is well worth it. Well done, Diamond. "
1325,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33430802-hailey,2,"I will be the first to say that I am not a huge non-fiction person. However, my eyes were opened to the genre over the summer when I read a phenomenal, fast-paced non-fiction novel for my AP Biology class, The Demon in the Freezer. This was no Demon in the Freezer.For starters, barely 30 pages into the book, the first red flag popped up. Jared Diamond is not a historian. Nor is he an anthropologist. Rather, he is an evolutionary biologist. So, okay. There's a slight connection. But still, I felt that it called into question his expertise on the topic. I found Diamond's writing to be terribly dry. Granted, history is, to me, not exactly the world's most exciting topic, but surely it could have been less bland. Maybe a joke or two? A pun? Something to keep the reader engaged? I didn't care much about the vast majority of the topics. Only a few really interested me, which I acknowledged was not the book's fault. But it was mighty difficult to trudge through each boring chapter. My only salvation was that each chapter was broken up into little mini passages, so I could give myself rewards for finishing a single passage. You think I'm kidding? Ask Alex.Another thing that saved this book from a DNF? The pictures. They were frequent enough for me to look forward to them and get excited whenever one popped up. It meant I didn't have to read a page! But the one strange thing about the pictures was that there were two twenty-page (each!) sections of the book that were simply photographic portraits of different people. There was not even a single mention of these photographs until the epilogue of the book, so I was like ""what is going on"" whenever one of these sections popped up literally in the middle of a sentence.The final gripe I have with the book was one section of a chapter in which Diamond did not write anything. Well, he quoted. He quoted for an entire chapter. Basically, it went down like this:""so, the invasion of the Incas by the Spanish was pretty bad but I don't really feel like explaining it to you, so here's a couple primary sources""Thanks??? The only reason this book deserves two stars is that at least some of the content is interesting. And, I must admit that I did learn something at the end, which is the point of a non-fiction novel.Overall, this just wasn't the book for me. It was terribly dense, bland, and boring, and had me watching the page count like a hawk, just waiting for page 431 to pop up. "
1326,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837466-dree,3,"This book is full of interesting ideas. What it is not full of is citations. Actually, there are NO citations. No footnotes, no endnotes, just the dreaded ""further reading"" sections in the back. Am I the only one that hates that? I doubt it.As I began reading I was flagging pages I had questions about. So many pages were flagged a gave up. This would be a GREAT book for discussion--in class, or in a book group. Me? I am arguing with myself and looking things up on Wikipedia. Not ideal.So...Diamond never defines ""agriculture"" or ""domestication"" to my satisfaction. Nor (obviously) does he give a source for a standard archeological or anthropological definition of either. Yet I kept wondering, through the entire book, where he was drawing lines. Native Australian canals for eel raising/harvesting is not domestication, not is it agriculture. So what is it? How does it not ""count""? I know the author has studied a lot in New Guinea. He talks about it. A lot. Yet India is virtually invisible in this book (except for the Chinese, Austronesians, and Europeans that traded there). Why? Why not a tidbit about Japan?Anything else you ask? Why yes. The author's tone is somewhat condescending, there is too much first person for my taste (""I think it is obvious"" ""When I was in New Guinea""), too many determinedly wobbly statements (such as ""make this inference virtually certain"" (348) and ""I would guess"" (349)), and way way WAY too much speculation (""What if Hitler had died in 1930?"" ""What if the Inca had..."" what if what if what if). There are also many statements like ""Protein starvation is probably also the ultimate reason why cannibalism was widespread in traditional New Guinea highland societies."" (p149). Really? Citation(s)? Please pretty please? That's a huge statement to stick a ""probably"" in the middle of, with no backup.So...what do I think? I don't know what to think. The book is interesting, if annoying. But without citations I really can't form a true opinion. I don't think Diamond has invented a new discipline ""Historical Science"" as he seems to think he has (epilogue). I would argue this book isn't a history book at all, it's geography, or anthropology. It's historical, yes, but it's not history.And I think it's a bit of a ripoff of Alfred Crosby. Whom Diamond mentions, but I don't think he gives him the credit he deserves."

1328,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7955372-ian-tymms,5,"One of those books you wonder how you missed. Getting on for 20 years old now but its basic thesis - that geography not genes is the determining factor as to why the Old World dominates the New - still struck me as clear, thoughtful and powerfully argued. The detail and complexity of what Diamond had to say was both compelling and surprisingly readable; I read every one of the 440 pages and a few of the endnotes to boot. One small quibble: in the 2003 afterward, Diamond discusses some of the implications raised by his final reflection in regards to the organisation of groups of people and the role of leadership in history. Specifically, he discusses conversations with the likes of Bill Gates about how best to organise teams in business. Whilst the conclusions of these reflections may be reasonable (they seemed so to me), they seemed to miss what I take to be the main point of the book: it is the geographical circumstances of humanities history which has been most clearly deterministic rather than specific human cultural or behavioural characteristics. The corollary of this observation in business would seem to me to have much more to do with the kind of industry and its location than with the behaviour of CEOs and employees. I would have thought Diamond's considerable insights might be more powerfully directed towards reflecting on where, when and how industries are located and the consequent implications for their success. This kind of reflection seems to me to fit more appropriately with the ""scientific"" approach he so consciously devotes to his approach in the bulk of ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"".Regardless, this is a powerful, brilliant book which has shaped and coloured my thinking and filled in some important holes in my understanding of the parts of the world where I live. I'm off to write a post on my blog about the Boonwurrung, the people whose culture and land my ancestors destroyed with their guns, germs and steel."
1329,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57132772-lin,2,"Full disclosure: I am writing this in one unpremeditated, unedited go, mostly on the adrenaline of deep frustration.It is baffling to me how dismissive—almost disdainful—Diamond is of the Chinese writing system throughout, with a level of unqualified criticism uncharacteristic of the rest of the book. “For example,” Diamond writes, “the prestige value of Chinese culture is still so great in Japan and Korea that Japan has no thought of discarding its Chinese-derived writing system despite its drawbacks for representing Japanese speech, while Korea is only now replacing its clumsy Chinese-derived writing with its wonderful indigenous hangul alphabet.” Is this what so-called objective “scientific writing” looks like? I don’t know who Diamond’s supposed Japanese and Korean friends are (he cites these nebulous figures once, with the affectation of one claiming “My black friends don’t ask me to say African-American”), but as a native Chinese speaker who did not learn the language through Diamond’s expressly preferred, Latin alphabet-based pinyin, as well as a Japanese speaker, I call Massive Bullshit on his unfounded, unprofessional condemnation.This is compounded with an additional 2003 chapter on Japan and Korea whose “guys, you’re ‘twin brothers,’ why don’t you make peace for the progress of humanity” policy recommendation I found condescending.I understand that these only make up a small percentage of what is an ambitious, expansive, painstakingly detailed cross-disciplinary work, but it was enough to deeply bother and distract at least one reader. I also find that, in the wake of Yuval Noah Harari’s bestsellers and the rise of scholarly podcasts, Diamond’s fact-dumping narrative voice is startlingly humorless, sometimes to the point of somnambulant. Having been told for almost a decade that this is a seminal work I must read to understand the world, this fell short of expectations—to say the least."
1330,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4699853-dara-salley,4,"I was less astounded by “Guns, Germs and Steel” than I might otherwise have been, partly due to the success of the book. Diamonds ideas are simple and persuasive. I’m sure that when they were first expounded in the 1997 that they created quite a stir. In the past two decades they have become part of the mainstream. I’m not sure when or where, but somehow I’ve heard almost all his arguments before. They’re part of my psyche. Reading Diamond’s book was less of a revelation for me and more like learning the details of something I already know.“Guns Germs and Steel” is about as thrilling as a book full of facts can be. It’s like attending a very interesting anthropology lecture; it’s work, but fun work. There were some moments when I zoned out a little. I felt that Diamond provided too many examples, but this complaint probably relates to what I said earlier. I came to this book already informed of Diamond’s thesis and halfway convinced. This made all the arguments somewhat superfluous for me.It’s a very intellectually satisfying book. Any mildly empathetic person will look at the inequities of the world feel frustrated. We want an answer that explains why terrible things happen to innocent people. Some find the answer in religion and the unknowable nature of God. If that isn’t a good enough answer for you, Diamond’s book will help fill in the gaps. He draws lines from climate and geography to colonialism, providing, if not a solution, at least and explanation for all the pain in the third world. I’m not saying that his arguments are 100% correct, but they will make you feel a little closer to finding order in a chaotic world."
1331,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4," Jared Diamond’s Pulitzer Prize winning book about how and why civilization emerged the way they did was very introspective and engaging. He is a biologist who lived in New Guinea. He came to appreciate the native people there and one in particular, Yani asked him why westerners had so much relative to the natives on New Guinea. He explored the reasons for why civilizations emerged as they did.Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture and written language in an interesting way. His explanation on the advantages of East-West orientation between Europe and Asia over North-South orientations of Africa and the Americas helped to explain why some areas dominated over others. Having navigable river systems instead of mountains and deserts helped spread the domestication of farming and the domestication of animals. Therefore, the emergence of farming flourished more in some areas, Eurasia, over others. All animals in nature could not be domesticated and used for farming like some of the big animals in Africa.Guns were a force in dominating some societies and the materials necessary are not found everywhere on our planet. He discussed the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by urban dwellers, and the harm caused to these urban dwellers who came in contact with the people who lacked these immunities. Steel was used for the making of weaponry and machinery so became prominent in later years. Diamonds explanations were cohesive and understandable. It is essential reading for anyone interested in reading how civilizations emerged."

It took me weeks to read, as I moved forward/backward a lot to get a better understanding and to become familiar with the details. Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is the macro history of human societies. This book is based on solid research and written as a text book--an introduction followed by well-organized chapters, each chapter contains detailed descriptions, a conclusion that summarizes the main points made in the book, ended with an epilogue where future enhancements and competing theories are briefly discussed.Geographical environment, including flora and fauna, shaped the early development of human societies. Its ripple effect is still felt today. There are lot of great, very interesting points. One of them is the comparison between the three regions of the old world: The Fertile Crescent, Europe and China. Was The Fertile Crescent the first region in the world where the environment made inhabitable by the inhabitants? China's early unity, a result of its environment, shaped China into a technological and social advanced country. However, from 15th century onwards, the same unity became a negative force and caused China to lag behind.Again, the book is the macro history, the board sketches of the past 11000 years of human life, not the micro history or the role of random events in the course of history. A full 5-star non-fiction."
1333,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964113-rise,4,"Amusing to read the slew of negative reviews in Amazon. It's hardly surprising though, given the subject matter of the book and its revolutionary approach to the interpretation of history. Prof. Diamond presents his case well that I think some of the debated quotes in the reviews were taken out of context, or were taken as absolutes. I can imagine why some arguments are controversial. They're not always ""politically correct"" and often run against conventional knowledge. Prof. Diamond is talking about the origin of ""races,"" why some are more affluent than others and why some are not destined to prosper. His central argument is quite basic: environment, not race, is the main determinant of success of societies. Very humane and obvious but still debatable. What is impressive is the wealth of evidence presented and the manner in which they are analyzed. The environmental approach to history can run the risk of the ""comprehensive syndrome,"" i.e., too detailed and sweeping and long, that it sometimes reads like a chore. I read it on and off for almost a year. It was like attending a course in ecology. On the strength of this book, I'd likely attend more lectures by Prof. Diamond through his other books."
1334,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17754981-stephen-yoder,4,"I had many ""whoa"" moments while reading this book. I had never realized that corn took so long to travel from the highlands of current Mexico to areas of the current USA. Once I got Diamond's point that many Eurasian epidemics have their roots in the diseases that strike domesticated animals of Eurasia I definitely smacked my own forehead. Wow. Using comparative linguistics to determine which people ate which plant or animal first is amazing. Food production, geography, environmental factors, domesticable animals, natural resources -- all of these things have greatly influenced the ebb and flow power from one region's peoples to another, and back again. Race, however, has not been a determinative factor. It is important to read books like this today when various groups express racist narratives about entire nations of people -- ""They don't send their best people"" or ""shithole countries.""Diamond's sense of humor and humility are steady currents underlying the entire book. He prefaces some sections with statements like, ""This chart will horrify academic experts in this field. . . but I generalize for a reason."" The story about the bedside interpreting at a hospital gone wrong is not one to be forgotten (hysterical!).I highly recommend this book. "
1335,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12486689-betty-ho,4,"The one sentence to summarize this book is ""history followed different courses for different people because of differences of the environment, not of biological differences among people themselves."" The logic behind is fairly straightforward - weather/ landscape affects wild plants/ animals availability for domestication which in turn affects the chance of food production and thus gems, technology, writing and eventually politics. Therefore, the reason you were born in a developed country and are more educated and wealthier is because your ancestors were lucky enough to be born in certain part of the world, NOT because your are smarter nor your gene is better than the rest of the world.I like the way how the author elaborates his logic. He uses tons of historical examples plus archeology discoveries - a perfect marriage between history and science. Although the empire of climate can only explain first half of the world history (probably until the time of medieval as the courses of modern history are far too complex to be explained only by environmental factors), this book has already provided answers to many many questions.    "
1336,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5936947-sean-chick,4,"Diamond's synthesis argues for geography not as the sole decider in human affairs but certainly as the main one. Any work of this sweep is going to have holes in its particulars, but Diamond is overall very persuasive. Yet, there is one serious failing that I detected: his discussion of technology. Diamond wants to reject the racial explanation for why whites came to dominate the world. In this he is right, but he goes too far. European technological superiority came in the main from the scientific revolution. This in large part explains why Europe became the center of world power. While Diamond is right that geography formed the basis for that revolution, there was something deeper happening in Europe that allowed for the swiftest technological revolution in history. And while the ""Great Man"" view of history is certainly false, it has its uses. Diamond, at least in his thoughtful conclusion acknowledges that. It is the great strength of the book; he makes a good argument but is no brute reductionist. Nuance is welcome.Last thing: the pictures in the book are the most bafflingly useless I have ever seen in a major work."
1337,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35395038-amith,5,"I am glad I picked up this book. If only I could throw hardbound copies of this book (weight: 2.1 lbs) at the faces of people going around distorting history. It presents a fascinating take on the evolution of human societies and manages to answer very fundamental and difficult questions in a clear and objective manner through the combined lens of geography, biology, linguistics and economics. One of the biggest statement the book makes is to show how strongly environmental quirks outside their control affect the trajectories of the societies living in it. I expected the book to be quite similar to Sapiens by Yuval Harari but they are very different books. I remember Yuval being a lot more personal with his narrative. Also, Jared is a lot more detailed in his materialistic comparison of different societies. I would have liked more information on how the Indian Subcontinent was populated. It does not find much mention. But stating that is not to deny the wealth of information that this book already offers.Published in 1997, it is 20 years old today but still highly recommended! "
1338,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,As a scientific book it fails overall.Pro:Diamond seems very sympathetic towards all people and cultures. He also knows a lot about different ways the societies collect food and in what environment they live in. Things he probably has learned from studying birds.Con:This is how not to do science. Most of his great conclusions are loosely based on the findings he picks out to support his ready made conclusions. Nothing is proved or disproved in any way in this book. And he completely ignores genetics and biology even though he talks about people who have adapted to different environments. Sure one group can have been adapted to an environment where there were fewer things to plant and fewer animals to tame. But how did that influence people's genetics? Because it must have done. Everything does. Where do we stand? This book was boring and not informative. It's basically a collection of facts mixed in with random opinions/assumptions. But I still like him and he seems sympathetic as a person.

I listened to the abridged audio (I hadn't realized it was abridged until I checked it out of the library, but decided to give it a shot, anyway). I'm not sure if some of the stuff that I think I missed (phrases that ""suddenly"" appeared without a definition, etc) was because I was not paying attention momentarily, or if it was something that was cut out of the book for the abridgment. I don't know if it would have made a difference if the version I had was unabridged, but the book was only o.k. for me. Somewhat interesting, but probably nothing I'll remember for any amount of time. I will probably still try another book by Diamond, however. "

I remember them making a big impression on me, so I put it on my to-read list... Fifteen years later, I did it! And I really liked it! Well organized, well explained, I felt like I learned so much, AND I want to keep learning more about human history and geography. In fact, now I wonder if I should've studied archaeology? Is it too late? Man, it gave me so much to think about. Half a point off because sometimes I felt like it was a little too repetitive on certain points."

Then, you have to admire that he somehow successfully drew it all together.The book is dense with information, all there to bolster his argument that geography matters a ton (or as summarised at book club, life is about shit dumb luck).I really liked the study of Polynesia as a microcosm of his theory.If there were crtitiques it'd be that it gets a bit repetitive by the end, and that he's so focussed on his theory he maybe doesn't consider other aspects of humanity (in that sense Sapiens makes an excellent companion volume).Definitely worth a future re-read and note-taking."

Also taken into account is that germs develop very differently with diffferent population densities, and more food requires more and better storage techniques and leads to development of beauracracy as well as expansionist tendencies which become more aggresssive with higher population density.6 August, 12017 HE(the Holocene Calendar)"

Guns, Germs and Steel should've been the start of that journey. If I knew better I would have read this book first and Sapiens after. The two complement each other almost perfectly.Guns, Germs and Steel focuses on the geographic and ecological impact of human development. It was very clear from start that Jared Diamond was fully aware of the limitations of historians to develop the equivalent of a scientific theory and that he made those limitations the strength of this book.I found the last part unnecessary. It functions as the demonstration of the theory, somewhat similar to the predictive properties of a scientific theory but in hindsight. However I felt it added nothing. The epilogue on the other hand is brilliant and fully justifies this last part."

I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the author's beautiful analysis using a very well-constructed framework that is highly nuanced and manages to rigorously explain the broad trends of history in simple language. This book is neither deterministic nor does it justify European colonization. The Epilogue is in itself worth reading in order to appreciate the author's wish to develop a historical science that is inter-disciplinary and follows a rigorous methodology based on natural experiments rather than approaching history through preconceived ideological frameworks."

This book changed the way I look at history, and nobody but the most die-hard racists can come away from it without having a thoroughly new outlook on the way the world is. Five stars way up."
1350,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138926-clint,3,"This book was three stars all the way through until I started reading the epilogue, which I thought was five stars, then I got to the second half of the epilogue, and it went back down to three. This is a really informative book, albeit a little dry. There is only so much information about corn and wheat that I can process on a given day. Most of the book was that, corn and wheat and cereal and grains and lots of other boring food words, and also a lot of linguistic stuff, which was pretty interesting, and some cool things about diseases (basically the reason you have such a kickass immune system is because your granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy slept with horses), but almost nothing about guns, which was what I was hoping to read. There is LOTS of repeating in this book, LOTS AND LOTS, and I think the epilogue (the first half, anyway) tells you much more succinctly what the first 400 or so pages said. And the book still barely answers the primary questions it started out with, mainly why has the whole world pretty much been run by Europeans (or Americans) for the last 500 years. Oddly, the book takes you right up until 500 years ago, then kind of runs out of steam right when it would be getting interesting. In the epilogue he timidly, slowly begins to touch on what to me seems really obvious, i.e. culture, but I guess in academia that's something you have to tip toe around. It's not at all hip or kosher to slam someone's culture, but culture has tons and tons to do with why and how a country functions the way it does. Give a certain group of people all the benefits in the world, but when corruption is accepted as a necessary part of society, when rabid nationalism and worship of anyone older than you is seen as the only way to not be an asshole, and when any new idea is seen as ridiculous strictly because it's new, you're going to have problems. Another thing that kind of irked me about this book was the continual use of putting certain phrases in quotation marks, like the ""discovery"" of the New World. Yeah, dork, I get it, no one really ""discovered"" the New World after 10,000 years ago, but I'm not a 10 year old brainwashed student, I get it. Another funny thing was he kept calling it a racist viewpoint to hold that white Europeans were so powerful because of a genetic superiority (and I would also think it's kind of racist), but then he turns around and says, in his opinion, New Guineans are on average more intelligent than Europeans. Typical guilty white liberal. So it's racist to say Europeans are smarter than other people, but not racist, I guess, to say New Guineans are smarter than other people? This kind of skyscraper-sized inconsistency is what drives me up the fucking wall when reading these kinds of books, and makes me feel there will never be any real progress in the social sciences because everyone's so sensitive about what they should or shouldn't say.

1351,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983551-neil-pearson,3,"I've known of this book for a long time and have even seen a documentary based on it so I finally took the plunge. I really like the central idea that the environment has shaped human societies (for better or worse) and that there isn't an intrinsic difference between people's of different environements - we're all suited to get the most out of our particular niches. I also understand the cascade effect of domesticating plants and animals. My issue with the book is that Diamond takes a far too deterministic view and makes individuals/groups to be mere passengers in the sweep of environmental history and I think that's too simplistic. While history may play out similarly based on the axis of the Earth I don't think it would play out exactly the same because there are simply too many variables. I did enjoy the discussion on plant and animal domestication though and the link with disease was fascinating. There's another fun snippet of linguistics as a historical tool (which is expanded upon in ""the third chimpanzee"") and the discussion on geographical barriers is interesting.I didn't enjoy his reductionist view on inventions and the idea they just happen along with the head-scratching claim that most ideas are acquired from other places (but they still have to come from somewhere!). He also has the habit of being a tiny bit apologetic when it comes to western society (in the sense they were lucky as opposed to justifying their actions) which I suspect is a knee-jerk reaction to all the imperialist works suggesting it's because Europeans were better than the ""savages"" but I think it would have been best to stick with the idea it's the environment that's shaped societies (although it's always going to be difficult to separate a leader's views from their environment). Diamond also skims over religion yet again which I always find frustrating but there is at least a brief discussion of its role in societies and how it can be used as a justification/tool in colonisation.The epilogue is very good at addressing a lot of my issues with some of his claims and convenient omissions throughout the book. The problem is that by that point I was already frustrated with some of the things he'd said (or hadn't) and that jaded my view of most of his claims in the main text. I'd certainly recommend new readers to skip to the epilogue after the introduction before reading the meat of the book as I know I'd have enjoyed it far more knowing he'd taken these other interpretations into consideration.Another fun thought I started to have towards the end of the book was that Yali might have wished he'd never asked Jared the cargo question if he'd had to listen to an 11 hour answer.It's still a great book for getting you to alter the way you look at things and I think it's something fantasy authors should look at when drawing their world maps too (I know I can't help but wonder where their fertile crescents are)!"

1353,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39746437-jonraven,3,"I really enjoyed this... for a while... until grew to dislike this after the first half. I found half the book almost entirely repetition and the latter bit on languages complexly boring and a hassle to follow. Every other page there would be a half page digression restating a dozen things already stated. It was a neat read. BUT I felt empiricism was a bit lacking at times. while much of the book is convincing, much of it is also the authors OWN opinions based on correlations/causations/inference style arguments to justify his ideas, some of which diverge from generally accepted ones. He has a tendency to infer and correlate and then peat himself so much so that by the time I finished the book I was cursing it.I was expecting something vastly different. this entire book is about food production and geographic inhibitions of it, which consequently benefit Eurasia while be disadvantageous to other places such as Australia. It has a very unempirical feel to it. The author himself even mentions people will disagree with his methodology and tries to back it up by calling sciences like Astronomy, historical science rather than actual science. The epilogue made me really dislike the author for his assumptions about some sciences not being sciences like astronomy. He claims you cant test anything and so, basically, he is saying his interred theories should be valid.. because as he sees it, Astronomy isn't scientific in that you cant test it. Just... wow... He also dismissed individual geniuses like Einstein... shrugging them all off... claiming that they were basically just lucky to be the ones that and the final touches on some innovation. The author, thus, comes off as very narcissistic and self absorbed in his own intellect. whether he is or not, I don't know, but the epilogue certainly suggested it.The first half was great. As I got maybe 60-70% through I grew weary and tired of his line of logic. I had hoped this were to be more factual based, than hypothetical. It felt as though I were reading someones PHD thesis by the end. He also has this irritating habit of mixing up the words is and are, making some sentences read oddly.I may seem vexed and I am. This book could have been a fraction of the size it was. I felt cheated by being forced to read so much repetition (yup, i am repeating this complaint again). I may not have picked this book up had I known what lie past the half way mark. Alas, I hate to leave a book unfinished, and it was interesting at times. I feel as though good chunks must be taken with a grain of salt. There are facts thrown in here and there however, I was expecting more of an actual history of civilizations/empires themselves, not so much a discourse on food production. Its an alright book at points, but could be better."
1354,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290837-ken,5,"Guns, Germs, and Steel (GGS) is an illuminating and sweeping panorama of human history. It is thought-provoking, logical, and debunks racist theories by highlighting the undeniable significance of geographic and climatic influences on the developments and progressions of human societies. For example, civilization and technology spread fastest throughout the Eurasian continent partly due its vast width and its east-west latitudinal axis, which allows for a fairly consistent temperate climate and a quicker spread of food production. Food production leads to societal/political organization and specialization of labor. This yields more leisure time to the educated elites, allowing them to cogitate, innovate, and develop world-changing technologies like gunpowder, the printing press, and the steam engine. The second largest continents, Africa and the Americas are narrower in width and have a north-south axis. This makes it more difficult for food production and peoples to spread since they have to transgress climatic hurdles (certain foods only grow at certain elevations and latitudes) such as the Sahara Desert and the Isthmus of Panama. Secondly, Africa and the Americas had fewer native, domesticable animals. Eurasia had horses, dogs, goats, cows, and sheep while North America and Africa had the less effective camels, llamas, and alpacas. Horses aided Eurasians in warfare, dogs in hunting, and goats, cows, and sheep on the farm in food production. You might be wondering- what about the vast animal diversity in Africa? Well, Africa’s zebra (the horse’s closest equivalent) is finicky, fearful, unaccommodating, and to this day has still not been domesticated. We all know how the various feline species (lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) are less submissive than dogs and therefore less domesticable. In its title GGS explains how the proximate factors of guns, germs, and steel enabled Europeans to first sail to the Americas and conquer the Native Americans and not the other way around. The ultimate factors that explain why the Europeans first came to possess guns, germs, and steel are due to their head start in food production and availability and use of domesticable animals (from which they derived many of the germs that would later wipe out the Native Americans). Eurasia also had more diverse plants available to begin and sustain food production. This book is a beast to get through (especially when reading about plants), but the sense of satisfaction and illumination obtained after conquering the beast and becoming more understanding of why societies developed at different rates is well worth it. Well done, Diamond. "
1355,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33430802-hailey,2,"I will be the first to say that I am not a huge non-fiction person. However, my eyes were opened to the genre over the summer when I read a phenomenal, fast-paced non-fiction novel for my AP Biology class, The Demon in the Freezer. This was no Demon in the Freezer.For starters, barely 30 pages into the book, the first red flag popped up. Jared Diamond is not a historian. Nor is he an anthropologist. Rather, he is an evolutionary biologist. So, okay. There's a slight connection. But still, I felt that it called into question his expertise on the topic. I found Diamond's writing to be terribly dry. Granted, history is, to me, not exactly the world's most exciting topic, but surely it could have been less bland. Maybe a joke or two? A pun? Something to keep the reader engaged? I didn't care much about the vast majority of the topics. Only a few really interested me, which I acknowledged was not the book's fault. But it was mighty difficult to trudge through each boring chapter. My only salvation was that each chapter was broken up into little mini passages, so I could give myself rewards for finishing a single passage. You think I'm kidding? Ask Alex.Another thing that saved this book from a DNF? The pictures. They were frequent enough for me to look forward to them and get excited whenever one popped up. It meant I didn't have to read a page! But the one strange thing about the pictures was that there were two twenty-page (each!) sections of the book that were simply photographic portraits of different people. There was not even a single mention of these photographs until the epilogue of the book, so I was like ""what is going on"" whenever one of these sections popped up literally in the middle of a sentence.The final gripe I have with the book was one section of a chapter in which Diamond did not write anything. Well, he quoted. He quoted for an entire chapter. Basically, it went down like this:""so, the invasion of the Incas by the Spanish was pretty bad but I don't really feel like explaining it to you, so here's a couple primary sources""Thanks??? The only reason this book deserves two stars is that at least some of the content is interesting. And, I must admit that I did learn something at the end, which is the point of a non-fiction novel.Overall, this just wasn't the book for me. It was terribly dense, bland, and boring, and had me watching the page count like a hawk, just waiting for page 431 to pop up. "
1356,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837466-dree,3,"This book is full of interesting ideas. What it is not full of is citations. Actually, there are NO citations. No footnotes, no endnotes, just the dreaded ""further reading"" sections in the back. Am I the only one that hates that? I doubt it.As I began reading I was flagging pages I had questions about. So many pages were flagged a gave up. This would be a GREAT book for discussion--in class, or in a book group. Me? I am arguing with myself and looking things up on Wikipedia. Not ideal.So...Diamond never defines ""agriculture"" or ""domestication"" to my satisfaction. Nor (obviously) does he give a source for a standard archeological or anthropological definition of either. Yet I kept wondering, through the entire book, where he was drawing lines. Native Australian canals for eel raising/harvesting is not domestication, not is it agriculture. So what is it? How does it not ""count""? I know the author has studied a lot in New Guinea. He talks about it. A lot. Yet India is virtually invisible in this book (except for the Chinese, Austronesians, and Europeans that traded there). Why? Why not a tidbit about Japan?Anything else you ask? Why yes. The author's tone is somewhat condescending, there is too much first person for my taste (""I think it is obvious"" ""When I was in New Guinea""), too many determinedly wobbly statements (such as ""make this inference virtually certain"" (348) and ""I would guess"" (349)), and way way WAY too much speculation (""What if Hitler had died in 1930?"" ""What if the Inca had..."" what if what if what if). There are also many statements like ""Protein starvation is probably also the ultimate reason why cannibalism was widespread in traditional New Guinea highland societies."" (p149). Really? Citation(s)? Please pretty please? That's a huge statement to stick a ""probably"" in the middle of, with no backup.So...what do I think? I don't know what to think. The book is interesting, if annoying. But without citations I really can't form a true opinion. I don't think Diamond has invented a new discipline ""Historical Science"" as he seems to think he has (epilogue). I would argue this book isn't a history book at all, it's geography, or anthropology. It's historical, yes, but it's not history.And I think it's a bit of a ripoff of Alfred Crosby. Whom Diamond mentions, but I don't think he gives him the credit he deserves."

1358,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7955372-ian-tymms,5,"One of those books you wonder how you missed. Getting on for 20 years old now but its basic thesis - that geography not genes is the determining factor as to why the Old World dominates the New - still struck me as clear, thoughtful and powerfully argued. The detail and complexity of what Diamond had to say was both compelling and surprisingly readable; I read every one of the 440 pages and a few of the endnotes to boot. One small quibble: in the 2003 afterward, Diamond discusses some of the implications raised by his final reflection in regards to the organisation of groups of people and the role of leadership in history. Specifically, he discusses conversations with the likes of Bill Gates about how best to organise teams in business. Whilst the conclusions of these reflections may be reasonable (they seemed so to me), they seemed to miss what I take to be the main point of the book: it is the geographical circumstances of humanities history which has been most clearly deterministic rather than specific human cultural or behavioural characteristics. The corollary of this observation in business would seem to me to have much more to do with the kind of industry and its location than with the behaviour of CEOs and employees. I would have thought Diamond's considerable insights might be more powerfully directed towards reflecting on where, when and how industries are located and the consequent implications for their success. This kind of reflection seems to me to fit more appropriately with the ""scientific"" approach he so consciously devotes to his approach in the bulk of ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"".Regardless, this is a powerful, brilliant book which has shaped and coloured my thinking and filled in some important holes in my understanding of the parts of the world where I live. I'm off to write a post on my blog about the Boonwurrung, the people whose culture and land my ancestors destroyed with their guns, germs and steel."
1359,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57132772-lin,2,"Full disclosure: I am writing this in one unpremeditated, unedited go, mostly on the adrenaline of deep frustration.It is baffling to me how dismissive—almost disdainful—Diamond is of the Chinese writing system throughout, with a level of unqualified criticism uncharacteristic of the rest of the book. “For example,” Diamond writes, “the prestige value of Chinese culture is still so great in Japan and Korea that Japan has no thought of discarding its Chinese-derived writing system despite its drawbacks for representing Japanese speech, while Korea is only now replacing its clumsy Chinese-derived writing with its wonderful indigenous hangul alphabet.” Is this what so-called objective “scientific writing” looks like? I don’t know who Diamond’s supposed Japanese and Korean friends are (he cites these nebulous figures once, with the affectation of one claiming “My black friends don’t ask me to say African-American”), but as a native Chinese speaker who did not learn the language through Diamond’s expressly preferred, Latin alphabet-based pinyin, as well as a Japanese speaker, I call Massive Bullshit on his unfounded, unprofessional condemnation.This is compounded with an additional 2003 chapter on Japan and Korea whose “guys, you’re ‘twin brothers,’ why don’t you make peace for the progress of humanity” policy recommendation I found condescending.I understand that these only make up a small percentage of what is an ambitious, expansive, painstakingly detailed cross-disciplinary work, but it was enough to deeply bother and distract at least one reader. I also find that, in the wake of Yuval Noah Harari’s bestsellers and the rise of scholarly podcasts, Diamond’s fact-dumping narrative voice is startlingly humorless, sometimes to the point of somnambulant. Having been told for almost a decade that this is a seminal work I must read to understand the world, this fell short of expectations—to say the least."
1360,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4699853-dara-salley,4,"I was less astounded by “Guns, Germs and Steel” than I might otherwise have been, partly due to the success of the book. Diamonds ideas are simple and persuasive. I’m sure that when they were first expounded in the 1997 that they created quite a stir. In the past two decades they have become part of the mainstream. I’m not sure when or where, but somehow I’ve heard almost all his arguments before. They’re part of my psyche. Reading Diamond’s book was less of a revelation for me and more like learning the details of something I already know.“Guns Germs and Steel” is about as thrilling as a book full of facts can be. It’s like attending a very interesting anthropology lecture; it’s work, but fun work. There were some moments when I zoned out a little. I felt that Diamond provided too many examples, but this complaint probably relates to what I said earlier. I came to this book already informed of Diamond’s thesis and halfway convinced. This made all the arguments somewhat superfluous for me.It’s a very intellectually satisfying book. Any mildly empathetic person will look at the inequities of the world feel frustrated. We want an answer that explains why terrible things happen to innocent people. Some find the answer in religion and the unknowable nature of God. If that isn’t a good enough answer for you, Diamond’s book will help fill in the gaps. He draws lines from climate and geography to colonialism, providing, if not a solution, at least and explanation for all the pain in the third world. I’m not saying that his arguments are 100% correct, but they will make you feel a little closer to finding order in a chaotic world."
1361,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4," Jared Diamond’s Pulitzer Prize winning book about how and why civilization emerged the way they did was very introspective and engaging. He is a biologist who lived in New Guinea. He came to appreciate the native people there and one in particular, Yani asked him why westerners had so much relative to the natives on New Guinea. He explored the reasons for why civilizations emerged as they did.Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture and written language in an interesting way. His explanation on the advantages of East-West orientation between Europe and Asia over North-South orientations of Africa and the Americas helped to explain why some areas dominated over others. Having navigable river systems instead of mountains and deserts helped spread the domestication of farming and the domestication of animals. Therefore, the emergence of farming flourished more in some areas, Eurasia, over others. All animals in nature could not be domesticated and used for farming like some of the big animals in Africa.Guns were a force in dominating some societies and the materials necessary are not found everywhere on our planet. He discussed the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by urban dwellers, and the harm caused to these urban dwellers who came in contact with the people who lacked these immunities. Steel was used for the making of weaponry and machinery so became prominent in later years. Diamonds explanations were cohesive and understandable.

It took me weeks to read, as I moved forward/backward a lot to get a better understanding and to become familiar with the details. Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is the macro history of human societies. This book is based on solid research and written as a text book--an introduction followed by well-organized chapters, each chapter contains detailed descriptions, a conclusion that summarizes the main points made in the book, ended with an epilogue where future enhancements and competing theories are briefly discussed.Geographical environment, including flora and fauna, shaped the early development of human societies. Its ripple effect is still felt today. There are lot of great, very interesting points. One of them is the comparison between the three regions of the old world: The Fertile Crescent, Europe and China. Was The Fertile Crescent the first region in the world where the environment made inhabitable by the inhabitants? China's early unity, a result of its environment, shaped China into a technological and social advanced country. However, from 15th century onwards, the same unity became a negative force and caused China to lag behind.Again, the book is the macro history, the board sketches of the past 11000 years of human life, not the micro history or the role of random events in the course of history. A full 5-star non-fiction."
1363,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964113-rise,4,"Amusing to read the slew of negative reviews in Amazon. It's hardly surprising though, given the subject matter of the book and its revolutionary approach to the interpretation of history. Prof. Diamond presents his case well that I think some of the debated quotes in the reviews were taken out of context, or were taken as absolutes. I can imagine why some arguments are controversial. They're not always ""politically correct"" and often run against conventional knowledge. Prof. Diamond is talking about the origin of ""races,"" why some are more affluent than others and why some are not destined to prosper. His central argument is quite basic: environment, not race, is the main determinant of success of societies. Very humane and obvious but still debatable. What is impressive is the wealth of evidence presented and the manner in which they are analyzed. The environmental approach to history can run the risk of the ""comprehensive syndrome,"" i.e., too detailed and sweeping and long, that it sometimes reads like a chore. I read it on and off for almost a year. It was like attending a course in ecology. On the strength of this book, I'd likely attend more lectures by Prof. Diamond through his other books."

I had never realized that corn took so long to travel from the highlands of current Mexico to areas of the current USA. Once I got Diamond's point that many Eurasian epidemics have their roots in the diseases that strike domesticated animals of Eurasia I definitely smacked my own forehead. Wow. Using comparative linguistics to determine which people ate which plant or animal first is amazing. Food production, geography, environmental factors, domesticable animals, natural resources -- all of these things have greatly influenced the ebb and flow power from one region's peoples to another, and back again. Race, however, has not been a determinative factor. It is important to read books like this today when various groups express racist narratives about entire nations of people -- ""They don't send their best people"" or ""shithole countries.""Diamond's sense of humor and humility are steady currents underlying the entire book. He prefaces some sections with statements like, ""This chart will horrify academic experts in this field. . . but I generalize for a reason."" The story about the bedside interpreting at a hospital gone wrong is not one to be forgotten (hysterical!).I highly recommend this book. "
1365,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12486689-betty-ho,4,"The one sentence to summarize this book is ""history followed different courses for different people because of differences of the environment, not of biological differences among people themselves."" The logic behind is fairly straightforward - weather/ landscape affects wild plants/ animals availability for domestication which in turn affects the chance of food production and thus gems, technology, writing and eventually politics. Therefore, the reason you were born in a developed country and are more educated and wealthier is because your ancestors were lucky enough to be born in certain part of the world, NOT because your are smarter nor your gene is better than the rest of the world.I like the way how the author elaborates his logic. He uses tons of historical examples plus archeology discoveries - a perfect marriage between history and science. Although the empire of climate can only explain first half of the world history (probably until the time of medieval as the courses of modern history are far too complex to be explained only by environmental factors), this book has already provided answers to many many questions.    "
1366,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5936947-sean-chick,4,"Diamond's synthesis argues for geography not as the sole decider in human affairs but certainly as the main one. Any work of this sweep is going to have holes in its particulars, but Diamond is overall very persuasive. Yet, there is one serious failing that I detected: his discussion of technology. Diamond wants to reject the racial explanation for why whites came to dominate the world. In this he is right, but he goes too far. European technological superiority came in the main from the scientific revolution. This in large part explains why Europe became the center of world power. While Diamond is right that geography formed the basis for that revolution, there was something deeper happening in Europe that allowed for the swiftest technological revolution in history. And while the ""Great Man"" view of history is certainly false, it has its uses. Diamond, at least in his thoughtful conclusion acknowledges that. It is the great strength of the book; he makes a good argument but is no brute reductionist. Nuance is welcome.Last thing: the pictures in the book are the most bafflingly useless I have ever seen in a major work."

If only I could throw hardbound copies of this book (weight: 2.1 lbs) at the faces of people going around distorting history. It presents a fascinating take on the evolution of human societies and manages to answer very fundamental and difficult questions in a clear and objective manner through the combined lens of geography, biology, linguistics and economics. One of the biggest statement the book makes is to show how strongly environmental quirks outside their control affect the trajectories of the societies living in it. I expected the book to be quite similar to Sapiens by Yuval Harari but they are very different books. I remember Yuval being a lot more personal with his narrative. Also, Jared is a lot more detailed in his materialistic comparison of different societies. I would have liked more information on how the Indian Subcontinent was populated. It does not find much mention. But stating that is not to deny the wealth of information that this book already offers.Published in 1997, it is 20 years old today but still highly recommended! "
1368,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,As a scientific book it fails overall.Pro:Diamond seems very sympathetic towards all people and cultures. He also knows a lot about different ways the societies collect food and in what environment they live in. Things he probably has learned from studying birds.Con:This is how not to do science. Most of his great conclusions are loosely based on the findings he picks out to support his ready made conclusions. Nothing is proved or disproved in any way in this book. And he completely ignores genetics and biology even though he talks about people who have adapted to different environments. Sure one group can have been adapted to an environment where there were fewer things to plant and fewer animals to tame. But how did that influence people's genetics? Because it must have done. Everything does. Where do we stand? This book was boring and not informative. It's basically a collection of facts mixed in with random opinions/assumptions. But I still like him and he seems sympathetic as a person.

I listened to the abridged audio (I hadn't realized it was abridged until I checked it out of the library, but decided to give it a shot, anyway). I'm not sure if some of the stuff that I think I missed (phrases that ""suddenly"" appeared without a definition, etc) was because I was not paying attention momentarily, or if it was something that was cut out of the book for the abridgment. I don't know if it would have made a difference if the version I had was unabridged, but the book was only o.k. for me. Somewhat interesting, but probably nothing I'll remember for any amount of time. I will probably still try another book by Diamond, however. "

I remember them making a big impression on me, so I put it on my to-read list... Fifteen years later, I did it! And I really liked it! Well organized, well explained, I felt like I learned so much, AND I want to keep learning more about human history and geography. In fact, now I wonder if I should've studied archaeology? Is it too late? Man, it gave me so much to think about. Half a point off because sometimes I felt like it was a little too repetitive on certain points."

Then, you have to admire that he somehow successfully drew it all together.The book is dense with information, all there to bolster his argument that geography matters a ton (or as summarised at book club, life is about shit dumb luck).I really liked the study of Polynesia as a microcosm of his theory.If there were crtitiques it'd be that it gets a bit repetitive by the end, and that he's so focussed on his theory he maybe doesn't consider other aspects of humanity (in that sense Sapiens makes an excellent companion volume).Definitely worth a future re-read and note-taking."

Also taken into account is that germs develop very differently with diffferent population densities, and more food requires more and better storage techniques and leads to development of beauracracy as well as expansionist tendencies which become more aggresssive with higher population density.6 August, 12017 HE(the Holocene Calendar)"

Guns, Germs and Steel should've been the start of that journey. If I knew better I would have read this book first and Sapiens after. The two complement each other almost perfectly.Guns, Germs and Steel focuses on the geographic and ecological impact of human development. It was very clear from start that Jared Diamond was fully aware of the limitations of historians to develop the equivalent of a scientific theory and that he made those limitations the strength of this book.I found the last part unnecessary. It functions as the demonstration of the theory, somewhat similar to the predictive properties of a scientific theory but in hindsight. However I felt it added nothing. The epilogue on the other hand is brilliant and fully justifies this last part."

I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the author's beautiful analysis using a very well-constructed framework that is highly nuanced and manages to rigorously explain the broad trends of history in simple language. This book is neither deterministic nor does it justify European colonization. The Epilogue is in itself worth reading in order to appreciate the author's wish to develop a historical science that is inter-disciplinary and follows a rigorous methodology based on natural experiments rather than approaching history through preconceived ideological frameworks."

This is the kind of uncommon reading of history you simply don't hear. It undermines so many casual racial explanations for the development and 'under-development' of the various parts of the globe. I'd say it's a must read just for the excellent geography lesson in every chapter. But the length it goes to in explaining the domestication of plants and animals over time is wonderful as well. Additionally, the language study is quite informative. Just a book full of marvels. "

""Why nations fail"", "" Sapiens:A brief history of humankind"" and ""Guns,Germs and Steel"". Of these 3, Sapiens is more fun. I will highly recommend that one. After reading sapiens, if you want to explore more, GGS is your pick. And if you want to delve more into the politcal aspects of history, ""why nations fail"" should be in your hand.

1379,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/197436-kenghis-khan,5,"I find it utterly unbelievable that this book gets anything less than five stars. Diamond can't state his elegant case strongly enough. This book changed the way I look at history, and nobody but the most die-hard racists can come away from it without having a thoroughly new outlook on the way the world is. Five stars way up."
1380,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138926-clint,3,"This book was three stars all the way through until I started reading the epilogue, which I thought was five stars, then I got to the second half of the epilogue, and it went back down to three. This is a really informative book, albeit a little dry. There is only so much information about corn and wheat that I can process on a given day. Most of the book was that, corn and wheat and cereal and grains and lots of other boring food words, and also a lot of linguistic stuff, which was pretty interesting, and some cool things about diseases (basically the reason you have such a kickass immune system is because your granddaddy's granddaddy's granddaddy slept with horses), but almost nothing about guns, which was what I was hoping to read. There is LOTS of repeating in this book, LOTS AND LOTS, and I think the epilogue (the first half, anyway) tells you much more succinctly what the first 400 or so pages said. And the book still barely answers the primary questions it started out with, mainly why has the whole world pretty much been run by Europeans (or Americans) for the last 500 years. Oddly, the book takes you right up until 500 years ago, then kind of runs out of steam right when it would be getting interesting. In the epilogue he timidly, slowly begins to touch on what to me seems really obvious, i.e. culture, but I guess in academia that's something you have to tip toe around. It's not at all hip or kosher to slam someone's culture, but culture has tons and tons to do with why and how a country functions the way it does. Give a certain group of people all the benefits in the world, but when corruption is accepted as a necessary part of society, when rabid nationalism and worship of anyone older than you is seen as the only way to not be an asshole, and when any new idea is seen as ridiculous strictly because it's new, you're going to have problems. Another thing that kind of irked me about this book was the continual use of putting certain phrases in quotation marks, like the ""discovery"" of the New World. Yeah, dork, I get it, no one really ""discovered"" the New World after 10,000 years ago, but I'm not a 10 year old brainwashed student, I get it. Another funny thing was he kept calling it a racist viewpoint to hold that white Europeans were so powerful because of a genetic superiority (and I would also think it's kind of racist), but then he turns around and says, in his opinion, New Guineans are on average more intelligent than Europeans. Typical guilty white liberal. So it's racist to say Europeans are smarter than other people, but not racist, I guess, to say New Guineans are smarter than other people? This kind of skyscraper-sized inconsistency is what drives me up the fucking wall when reading these kinds of books, and makes me feel there will never be any real progress in the social sciences because everyone's so sensitive about what they should or shouldn't say.

1381,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983551-neil-pearson,3,"I've known of this book for a long time and have even seen a documentary based on it so I finally took the plunge. I really like the central idea that the environment has shaped human societies (for better or worse) and that there isn't an intrinsic difference between people's of different environements - we're all suited to get the most out of our particular niches. I also understand the cascade effect of domesticating plants and animals. My issue with the book is that Diamond takes a far too deterministic view and makes individuals/groups to be mere passengers in the sweep of environmental history and I think that's too simplistic. While history may play out similarly based on the axis of the Earth I don't think it would play out exactly the same because there are simply too many variables. I did enjoy the discussion on plant and animal domestication though and the link with disease was fascinating. There's another fun snippet of linguistics as a historical tool (which is expanded upon in ""the third chimpanzee"") and the discussion on geographical barriers is interesting.I didn't enjoy his reductionist view on inventions and the idea they just happen along with the head-scratching claim that most ideas are acquired from other places (but they still have to come from somewhere!). He also has the habit of being a tiny bit apologetic when it comes to western society (in the sense they were lucky as opposed to justifying their actions) which I suspect is a knee-jerk reaction to all the imperialist works suggesting it's because Europeans were better than the ""savages"" but I think it would have been best to stick with the idea it's the environment that's shaped societies (although it's always going to be difficult to separate a leader's views from their environment). Diamond also skims over religion yet again which I always find frustrating but there is at least a brief discussion of its role in societies and how it can be used as a justification/tool in colonisation.The epilogue is very good at addressing a lot of my issues with some of his claims and convenient omissions throughout the book. The problem is that by that point I was already frustrated with some of the things he'd said (or hadn't) and that jaded my view of most of his claims in the main text. I'd certainly recommend new readers to skip to the epilogue after the introduction before reading the meat of the book as I know I'd have enjoyed it far more knowing he'd taken these other interpretations into consideration.Another fun thought I started to have towards the end of the book was that Yali might have wished he'd never asked Jared the cargo question if he'd had to listen to an 11 hour answer.It's still a great book for getting you to alter the way you look at things and I think it's something fantasy authors should look at when drawing their world maps too (I know I can't help but wonder where their fertile crescents are)!"

1383,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39746437-jonraven,3,"I really enjoyed this... for a while... until grew to dislike this after the first half. I found half the book almost entirely repetition and the latter bit on languages complexly boring and a hassle to follow. Every other page there would be a half page digression restating a dozen things already stated. It was a neat read. BUT I felt empiricism was a bit lacking at times. while much of the book is convincing, much of it is also the authors OWN opinions based on correlations/causations/inference style arguments to justify his ideas, some of which diverge from generally accepted ones. He has a tendency to infer and correlate and then peat himself so much so that by the time I finished the book I was cursing it.I was expecting something vastly different. this entire book is about food production and geographic inhibitions of it, which consequently benefit Eurasia while be disadvantageous to other places such as Australia. It has a very unempirical feel to it. The author himself even mentions people will disagree with his methodology and tries to back it up by calling sciences like Astronomy, historical science rather than actual science. The epilogue made me really dislike the author for his assumptions about some sciences not being sciences like astronomy. He claims you cant test anything and so, basically, he is saying his interred theories should be valid.. because as he sees it, Astronomy isn't scientific in that you cant test it. Just... wow... He also dismissed individual geniuses like Einstein... shrugging them all off... claiming that they were basically just lucky to be the ones that and the final touches on some innovation. The author, thus, comes off as very narcissistic and self absorbed in his own intellect. whether he is or not, I don't know, but the epilogue certainly suggested it.The first half was great. As I got maybe 60-70% through I grew weary and tired of his line of logic. I had hoped this were to be more factual based, than hypothetical. It felt as though I were reading someones PHD thesis by the end. He also has this irritating habit of mixing up the words is and are, making some sentences read oddly.I may seem vexed and I am. This book could have been a fraction of the size it was. I felt cheated by being forced to read so much repetition (yup, i am repeating this complaint again). I may not have picked this book up had I known what lie past the half way mark. Alas, I hate to leave a book unfinished, and it was interesting at times. I feel as though good chunks must be taken with a grain of salt. There are facts thrown in here and there however, I was expecting more of an actual history of civilizations/empires themselves, not so much a discourse on food production. Its an alright book at points, but could be better."
1384,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290837-ken,5,"Guns, Germs, and Steel (GGS) is an illuminating and sweeping panorama of human history. It is thought-provoking, logical, and debunks racist theories by highlighting the undeniable significance of geographic and climatic influences on the developments and progressions of human societies. For example, civilization and technology spread fastest throughout the Eurasian continent partly due its vast width and its east-west latitudinal axis, which allows for a fairly consistent temperate climate and a quicker spread of food production. Food production leads to societal/political organization and specialization of labor. This yields more leisure time to the educated elites, allowing them to cogitate, innovate, and develop world-changing technologies like gunpowder, the printing press, and the steam engine. The second largest continents, Africa and the Americas are narrower in width and have a north-south axis. This makes it more difficult for food production and peoples to spread since they have to transgress climatic hurdles (certain foods only grow at certain elevations and latitudes) such as the Sahara Desert and the Isthmus of Panama. Secondly, Africa and the Americas had fewer native, domesticable animals. Eurasia had horses, dogs, goats, cows, and sheep while North America and Africa had the less effective camels, llamas, and alpacas. Horses aided Eurasians in warfare, dogs in hunting, and goats, cows, and sheep on the farm in food production. You might be wondering- what about the vast animal diversity in Africa? Well, Africa’s zebra (the horse’s closest equivalent) is finicky, fearful, unaccommodating, and to this day has still not been domesticated. We all know how the various feline species (lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) are less submissive than dogs and therefore less domesticable. In its title GGS explains how the proximate factors of guns, germs, and steel enabled Europeans to first sail to the Americas and conquer the Native Americans and not the other way around. The ultimate factors that explain why the Europeans first came to possess guns, germs, and steel are due to their head start in food production and availability and use of domesticable animals (from which they derived many of the germs that would later wipe out the Native Americans). Eurasia also had more diverse plants available to begin and sustain food production. This book is a beast to get through (especially when reading about plants), but the sense of satisfaction and illumination obtained after conquering the beast and becoming more understanding of why societies developed at different rates is well worth it. Well done, Diamond. "
1385,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33430802-hailey,2,"I will be the first to say that I am not a huge non-fiction person. However, my eyes were opened to the genre over the summer when I read a phenomenal, fast-paced non-fiction novel for my AP Biology class, The Demon in the Freezer. This was no Demon in the Freezer.For starters, barely 30 pages into the book, the first red flag popped up. Jared Diamond is not a historian. Nor is he an anthropologist. Rather, he is an evolutionary biologist. So, okay. There's a slight connection. But still, I felt that it called into question his expertise on the topic. I found Diamond's writing to be terribly dry. Granted, history is, to me, not exactly the world's most exciting topic, but surely it could have been less bland. Maybe a joke or two? A pun? Something to keep the reader engaged? I didn't care much about the vast majority of the topics. Only a few really interested me, which I acknowledged was not the book's fault. But it was mighty difficult to trudge through each boring chapter. My only salvation was that each chapter was broken up into little mini passages, so I could give myself rewards for finishing a single passage. You think I'm kidding? Ask Alex.Another thing that saved this book from a DNF? The pictures. They were frequent enough for me to look forward to them and get excited whenever one popped up. It meant I didn't have to read a page! But the one strange thing about the pictures was that there were two twenty-page (each!) sections of the book that were simply photographic portraits of different people. There was not even a single mention of these photographs until the epilogue of the book, so I was like ""what is going on"" whenever one of these sections popped up literally in the middle of a sentence.The final gripe I have with the book was one section of a chapter in which Diamond did not write anything. Well, he quoted. He quoted for an entire chapter. Basically, it went down like this:""so, the invasion of the Incas by the Spanish was pretty bad but I don't really feel like explaining it to you, so here's a couple primary sources""Thanks??? The only reason this book deserves two stars is that at least some of the content is interesting. And, I must admit that I did learn something at the end, which is the point of a non-fiction novel.Overall, this just wasn't the book for me. It was terribly dense, bland, and boring, and had me watching the page count like a hawk, just waiting for page 431 to pop up. "
1386,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837466-dree,3,"This book is full of interesting ideas. What it is not full of is citations. Actually, there are NO citations. No footnotes, no endnotes, just the dreaded ""further reading"" sections in the back. Am I the only one that hates that? I doubt it.As I began reading I was flagging pages I had questions about. So many pages were flagged a gave up. This would be a GREAT book for discussion--in class, or in a book group. Me? I am arguing with myself and looking things up on Wikipedia. Not ideal.So...Diamond never defines ""agriculture"" or ""domestication"" to my satisfaction. Nor (obviously) does he give a source for a standard archeological or anthropological definition of either. Yet I kept wondering, through the entire book, where he was drawing lines. Native Australian canals for eel raising/harvesting is not domestication, not is it agriculture. So what is it? How does it not ""count""? I know the author has studied a lot in New Guinea. He talks about it. A lot. Yet India is virtually invisible in this book (except for the Chinese, Austronesians, and Europeans that traded there). Why? Why not a tidbit about Japan?Anything else you ask? Why yes. The author's tone is somewhat condescending, there is too much first person for my taste (""I think it is obvious"" ""When I was in New Guinea""), too many determinedly wobbly statements (such as ""make this inference virtually certain"" (348) and ""I would guess"" (349)), and way way WAY too much speculation (""What if Hitler had died in 1930?"" ""What if the Inca had..."" what if what if what if). There are also many statements like ""Protein starvation is probably also the ultimate reason why cannibalism was widespread in traditional New Guinea highland societies."" (p149). Really? Citation(s)? Please pretty please? That's a huge statement to stick a ""probably"" in the middle of, with no backup.So...what do I think? I don't know what to think. The book is interesting, if annoying. But without citations I really can't form a true opinion. I don't think Diamond has invented a new discipline ""Historical Science"" as he seems to think he has (epilogue). I would argue this book isn't a history book at all, it's geography, or anthropology. It's historical, yes, but it's not history.And I think it's a bit of a ripoff of Alfred Crosby. Whom Diamond mentions, but I don't think he gives him the credit he deserves."

1388,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7955372-ian-tymms,5,"One of those books you wonder how you missed. Getting on for 20 years old now but its basic thesis - that geography not genes is the determining factor as to why the Old World dominates the New - still struck me as clear, thoughtful and powerfully argued. The detail and complexity of what Diamond had to say was both compelling and surprisingly readable; I read every one of the 440 pages and a few of the endnotes to boot. One small quibble: in the 2003 afterward, Diamond discusses some of the implications raised by his final reflection in regards to the organisation of groups of people and the role of leadership in history. Specifically, he discusses conversations with the likes of Bill Gates about how best to organise teams in business. Whilst the conclusions of these reflections may be reasonable (they seemed so to me), they seemed to miss what I take to be the main point of the book: it is the geographical circumstances of humanities history which has been most clearly deterministic rather than specific human cultural or behavioural characteristics. The corollary of this observation in business would seem to me to have much more to do with the kind of industry and its location than with the behaviour of CEOs and employees. I would have thought Diamond's considerable insights might be more powerfully directed towards reflecting on where, when and how industries are located and the consequent implications for their success. This kind of reflection seems to me to fit more appropriately with the ""scientific"" approach he so consciously devotes to his approach in the bulk of ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"".Regardless, this is a powerful, brilliant book which has shaped and coloured my thinking and filled in some important holes in my understanding of the parts of the world where I live. I'm off to write a post on my blog about the Boonwurrung, the people whose culture and land my ancestors destroyed with their guns, germs and steel."
1389,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57132772-lin,2,"Full disclosure: I am writing this in one unpremeditated, unedited go, mostly on the adrenaline of deep frustration.It is baffling to me how dismissive—almost disdainful—Diamond is of the Chinese writing system throughout, with a level of unqualified criticism uncharacteristic of the rest of the book. “For example,” Diamond writes, “the prestige value of Chinese culture is still so great in Japan and Korea that Japan has no thought of discarding its Chinese-derived writing system despite its drawbacks for representing Japanese speech, while Korea is only now replacing its clumsy Chinese-derived writing with its wonderful indigenous hangul alphabet.” Is this what so-called objective “scientific writing” looks like? I don’t know who Diamond’s supposed Japanese and Korean friends are (he cites these nebulous figures once, with the affectation of one claiming “My black friends don’t ask me to say African-American”), but as a native Chinese speaker who did not learn the language through Diamond’s expressly preferred, Latin alphabet-based pinyin, as well as a Japanese speaker, I call Massive Bullshit on his unfounded, unprofessional condemnation.This is compounded with an additional 2003 chapter on Japan and Korea whose “guys, you’re ‘twin brothers,’ why don’t you make peace for the progress of humanity” policy recommendation I found condescending.I understand that these only make up a small percentage of what is an ambitious, expansive, painstakingly detailed cross-disciplinary work, but it was enough to deeply bother and distract at least one reader. I also find that, in the wake of Yuval Noah Harari’s bestsellers and the rise of scholarly podcasts, Diamond’s fact-dumping narrative voice is startlingly humorless, sometimes to the point of somnambulant. Having been told for almost a decade that this is a seminal work I must read to understand the world, this fell short of expectations—to say the least."
1390,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4699853-dara-salley,4,"I was less astounded by “Guns, Germs and Steel” than I might otherwise have been, partly due to the success of the book. Diamonds ideas are simple and persuasive. I’m sure that when they were first expounded in the 1997 that they created quite a stir. In the past two decades they have become part of the mainstream. I’m not sure when or where, but somehow I’ve heard almost all his arguments before. They’re part of my psyche. Reading Diamond’s book was less of a revelation for me and more like learning the details of something I already know.“Guns Germs and Steel” is about as thrilling as a book full of facts can be. It’s like attending a very interesting anthropology lecture; it’s work, but fun work. There were some moments when I zoned out a little. I felt that Diamond provided too many examples, but this complaint probably relates to what I said earlier. I came to this book already informed of Diamond’s thesis and halfway convinced. This made all the arguments somewhat superfluous for me.It’s a very intellectually satisfying book. Any mildly empathetic person will look at the inequities of the world feel frustrated. We want an answer that explains why terrible things happen to innocent people. Some find the answer in religion and the unknowable nature of God. If that isn’t a good enough answer for you, Diamond’s book will help fill in the gaps. He draws lines from climate and geography to colonialism, providing, if not a solution, at least and explanation for all the pain in the third world. I’m not saying that his arguments are 100% correct, but they will make you feel a little closer to finding order in a chaotic world."
1391,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4," Jared Diamond’s Pulitzer Prize winning book about how and why civilization emerged the way they did was very introspective and engaging. He is a biologist who lived in New Guinea. He came to appreciate the native people there and one in particular, Yani asked him why westerners had so much relative to the natives on New Guinea. He explored the reasons for why civilizations emerged as they did.Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture and written language in an interesting way. His explanation on the advantages of East-West orientation between Europe and Asia over North-South orientations of Africa and the Americas helped to explain why some areas dominated over others. Having navigable river systems instead of mountains and deserts helped spread the domestication of farming and the domestication of animals. Therefore, the emergence of farming flourished more in some areas, Eurasia, over others. All animals in nature could not be domesticated and used for farming like some of the big animals in Africa.Guns were a force in dominating some societies and the materials necessary are not found everywhere on our planet. He discussed the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by urban dwellers, and the harm caused to these urban dwellers who came in contact with the people who lacked these immunities. Steel was used for the making of weaponry and machinery so became prominent in later years. Diamonds explanations were cohesive and understandable. It is essential reading for anyone interested in reading how civilizations emerged."
1392,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"I finally finished this classical anthropology book, which has been sitting on my TBR in last 5 years. It took me weeks to read, as I moved forward/backward a lot to get a better understanding and to become familiar with the details. Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies is the macro history of human societies. This book is based on solid research and written as a text book--an introduction followed by well-organized chapters, each chapter contains detailed descriptions, a conclusion that summarizes the main points made in the book, ended with an epilogue where future enhancements and competing theories are briefly discussed.Geographical environment, including flora and fauna, shaped the early development of human societies. Its ripple effect is still felt today. There are lot of great, very interesting points. One of them is the comparison between the three regions of the old world: The Fertile Crescent, Europe and China. Was The Fertile Crescent the first region in the world where the environment made inhabitable by the inhabitants? China's early unity, a result of its environment, shaped China into a technological and social advanced country. However, from 15th century onwards, the same unity became a negative force and caused China to lag behind.Again, the book is the macro history, the board sketches of the past 11000 years of human life, not the micro history or the role of random events in the course of history. A full 5-star non-fiction."
1393,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964113-rise,4,"Amusing to read the slew of negative reviews in Amazon. It's hardly surprising though, given the subject matter of the book and its revolutionary approach to the interpretation of history. Prof. Diamond presents his case well that I think some of the debated quotes in the reviews were taken out of context, or were taken as absolutes. I can imagine why some arguments are controversial. They're not always ""politically correct"" and often run against conventional knowledge. Prof. Diamond is talking about the origin of ""races,"" why some are more affluent than others and why some are not destined to prosper. His central argument is quite basic: environment, not race, is the main determinant of success of societies. Very humane and obvious but still debatable. What is impressive is the wealth of evidence presented and the manner in which they are analyzed. The environmental approach to history can run the risk of the ""comprehensive syndrome,"" i.e., too detailed and sweeping and long, that it sometimes reads like a chore. I read it on and off for almost a year. It was like attending a course in ecology. On the strength of this book, I'd likely attend more lectures by Prof. Diamond through his other books."
1394,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17754981-stephen-yoder,4,"I had many ""whoa"" moments while reading this book. I had never realized that corn took so long to travel from the highlands of current Mexico to areas of the current USA. Once I got Diamond's point that many Eurasian epidemics have their roots in the diseases that strike domesticated animals of Eurasia I definitely smacked my own forehead. Wow. Using comparative linguistics to determine which people ate which plant or animal first is amazing. Food production, geography, environmental factors, domesticable animals, natural resources -- all of these things have greatly influenced the ebb and flow power from one region's peoples to another, and back again. Race, however, has not been a determinative factor. It is important to read books like this today when various groups express racist narratives about entire nations of people -- ""They don't send their best people"" or ""shithole countries.""Diamond's sense of humor and humility are steady currents underlying the entire book. He prefaces some sections with statements like, ""This chart will horrify academic experts in this field. . . but I generalize for a reason."" The story about the bedside interpreting at a hospital gone wrong is not one to be forgotten (hysterical!).I highly recommend this book. "
1395,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12486689-betty-ho,4,"The one sentence to summarize this book is ""history followed different courses for different people because of differences of the environment, not of biological differences among people themselves."" The logic behind is fairly straightforward - weather/ landscape affects wild plants/ animals availability for domestication which in turn affects the chance of food production and thus gems, technology, writing and eventually politics. Therefore, the reason you were born in a developed country and are more educated and wealthier is because your ancestors were lucky enough to be born in certain part of the world, NOT because your are smarter nor your gene is better than the rest of the world.I like the way how the author elaborates his logic. He uses tons of historical examples plus archeology discoveries - a perfect marriage between history and science. Although the empire of climate can only explain first half of the world history (probably until the time of medieval as the courses of modern history are far too complex to be explained only by environmental factors), this book has already provided answers to many many questions.    "
1396,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5936947-sean-chick,4,"Diamond's synthesis argues for geography not as the sole decider in human affairs but certainly as the main one. Any work of this sweep is going to have holes in its particulars, but Diamond is overall very persuasive. Yet, there is one serious failing that I detected: his discussion of technology. Diamond wants to reject the racial explanation for why whites came to dominate the world. In this he is right, but he goes too far. European technological superiority came in the main from the scientific revolution. This in large part explains why Europe became the center of world power. While Diamond is right that geography formed the basis for that revolution, there was something deeper happening in Europe that allowed for the swiftest technological revolution in history. And while the ""Great Man"" view of history is certainly false, it has its uses. Diamond, at least in his thoughtful conclusion acknowledges that. It is the great strength of the book; he makes a good argument but is no brute reductionist. Nuance is welcome.Last thing: the pictures in the book are the most bafflingly useless I have ever seen in a major work."
1397,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35395038-amith,5,"I am glad I picked up this book. If only I could throw hardbound copies of this book (weight: 2.1 lbs) at the faces of people going around distorting history. It presents a fascinating take on the evolution of human societies and manages to answer very fundamental and difficult questions in a clear and objective manner through the combined lens of geography, biology, linguistics and economics. One of the biggest statement the book makes is to show how strongly environmental quirks outside their control affect the trajectories of the societies living in it. I expected the book to be quite similar to Sapiens by Yuval Harari but they are very different books. I remember Yuval being a lot more personal with his narrative. Also, Jared is a lot more detailed in his materialistic comparison of different societies. I would have liked more information on how the Indian Subcontinent was populated. It does not find much mention. But stating that is not to deny the wealth of information that this book already offers.Published in 1997, it is 20 years old today but still highly recommended! "
1398,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,As a scientific book it fails overall.Pro:Diamond seems very sympathetic towards all people and cultures. He also knows a lot about different ways the societies collect food and in what environment they live in. Things he probably has learned from studying birds.Con:This is how not to do science. Most of his great conclusions are loosely based on the findings he picks out to support his ready made conclusions. Nothing is proved or disproved in any way in this book. And he completely ignores genetics and biology even though he talks about people who have adapted to different environments. Sure one group can have been adapted to an environment where there were fewer things to plant and fewer animals to tame. But how did that influence people's genetics? Because it must have done. Everything does. Where do we stand? This book was boring and not informative. It's basically a collection of facts mixed in with random opinions/assumptions. But I still like him and he seems sympathetic as a person.

I listened to the abridged audio (I hadn't realized it was abridged until I checked it out of the library, but decided to give it a shot, anyway). I'm not sure if some of the stuff that I think I missed (phrases that ""suddenly"" appeared without a definition, etc) was because I was not paying attention momentarily, or if it was something that was cut out of the book for the abridgment. I don't know if it would have made a difference if the version I had was unabridged, but the book was only o.k. for me. Somewhat interesting, but probably nothing I'll remember for any amount of time. I will probably still try another book by Diamond, however. "

I remember them making a big impression on me, so I put it on my to-read list... Fifteen years later, I did it! And I really liked it! Well organized, well explained, I felt like I learned so much, AND I want to keep learning more about human history and geography. In fact, now I wonder if I should've studied archaeology? Is it too late? Man, it gave me so much to think about. Half a point off because sometimes I felt like it was a little too repetitive on certain points."

Then, you have to admire that he somehow successfully drew it all together.The book is dense with information, all there to bolster his argument that geography matters a ton (or as summarised at book club, life is about shit dumb luck).I really liked the study of Polynesia as a microcosm of his theory.If there were crtitiques it'd be that it gets a bit repetitive by the end, and that he's so focussed on his theory he maybe doesn't consider other aspects of humanity (in that sense Sapiens makes an excellent companion volume).Definitely worth a future re-read and note-taking."

Also taken into account is that germs develop very differently with diffferent population densities, and more food requires more and better storage techniques and leads to development of beauracracy as well as expansionist tendencies which become more aggresssive with higher population density.6 August, 12017 HE(the Holocene Calendar)"

Guns, Germs and Steel should've been the start of that journey. If I knew better I would have read this book first and Sapiens after. The two complement each other almost perfectly.Guns, Germs and Steel focuses on the geographic and ecological impact of human development. It was very clear from start that Jared Diamond was fully aware of the limitations of historians to develop the equivalent of a scientific theory and that he made those limitations the strength of this book.I found the last part unnecessary. It functions as the demonstration of the theory, somewhat similar to the predictive properties of a scientific theory but in hindsight. However I felt it added nothing. The epilogue on the other hand is brilliant and fully justifies this last part."

I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the author's beautiful analysis using a very well-constructed framework that is highly nuanced and manages to rigorously explain the broad trends of history in simple language. This book is neither deterministic nor does it justify European colonization. The Epilogue is in itself worth reading in order to appreciate the author's wish to develop a historical science that is inter-disciplinary and follows a rigorous methodology based on natural experiments rather than approaching history through preconceived ideological frameworks."

This is the kind of uncommon reading of history you simply don't hear. It undermines so many casual racial explanations for the development and 'under-development' of the various parts of the globe. I'd say it's a must read just for the excellent geography lesson in every chapter. But the length it goes to in explaining the domestication of plants and animals over time is wonderful as well. Additionally, the language study is quite informative. Just a book full of marvels. "

1414,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
1415,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."

It is a book that everyone should read but might not want to. I am in grad school and have to read several books at a time. This was the book I chose for my light reading outside of class, lol. Diamond traces the origins of civilization from the Fertile Cresent to every corner of the world and his results are well researched, scholarly, and important. I did find however, that the book could be quite dry. The book is around 400 pages but it felt more like a book more than double that length. "
1417,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
1418,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
1419,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
1420,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
1421,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it.

For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes.

The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
1431,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
1432,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
1433,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
1434,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
1435,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try

And specifically by way of explaining Europe's dominance as an accident of environment – species availability, geography, that sort of thing – rather than anything inherent to its peoples or, just as often, anything inherently inferior about the native populations of the rest of the globe.Hmm. An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good. And then I start getting a feeling, just a niggle, like there's something I'm not seeing. And then it slowly dawns on me and I go, "". . . wait . . . wait, no. Really?""What I wasn't seeing here were proper citations. I assumed at first this was an artifact of the audiobook, since they maddeningly cut non-substantive footnotes. (I usually get an e-text to check later, if I am curious. Which I'm me, so I generally am.) But when I checked here, nope, almost nothing.But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."
1437,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest,4,"Why did the Europeans become the dominant force of colonization in the late 13th century? Why not the Incans, or the Chinese? Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."
1438,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"Very interesting and worthwhile -- won a Pulitzer. I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
1439,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "

1444,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
1445,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."

1447,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
1448,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
1449,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
1450,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
1451,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "

Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."

Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it. Recommended if you're ok with the cautions I mention above."

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book.

For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes. But he's going on about it for almost forty minutes.So, one day I'll read this.

1460,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53002487-coachjim,5,"Guns, Germs, and Steelby Jared DiamondThis is not light reading. The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
1461,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
1462,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
1463,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
1464,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
1465,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try

An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good.

The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people.

Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."

I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
1469,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "

1474,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7486808-anusha-jayaram,5,"Geographic determinism: That's the entire book, summed up in those two words. (I'm glad Diamond didn't mention this phrase till the very end of the book. It might have made me read through the entire book diagonally, thereby missing several points along the way). Diamond reasons (in a nutshell) that the ultimate causes of every disparity in our modern world can be traced back to certain basic factors:- Food production & Animal domestication: availability of viable raw material.- Geographic characteristics, Climatic conditions: soil, rainfall, temperature, humidity, water access- Geographic connectedness / isolation (including latitudinal / longitudinal spread), Terrain fragmentationFirst, a note on the writing style. It is typical in its didactic format: he tells you what he is going to tell you, then he tells you, then summarises what he told you. This is fairly useful in drilling his central message into your head. But the downside is that it can get very repetitive. One begins to wonder whether all the repetitions could have been done away with, giving the reader a more concise book. Things that could easily have been repeated less often are: 1. Repeating the central theme ad nauseam in great detail2. Focussing disproportionately on the New Guinea islands. I do understand that this is due to the extensive field research Diamond has conducted in these islands - naturally he would tend to go into more detail concerning them compared to other regions of the world. But my personal opinion is that he could have shortened that narrative without losing out on important details.3. Revisiting several times the conquering of Native Americans by European invaders. The back and forth manner of this kind of story telling has the advantage that it is engaging, and enables easier reading. But it also requires that every detail not be repeated each time one flips forward or backward in time - this is likely to bore a reader who remembers the details from the last time he / she read them (or the time before the last, OR the time before that one...and so on)I liked the occasional humour, and the conversational tone of the book - these made it easily accessible to the lay reader. And IMO, it is important that books dealing with such topics be accessible to anybody who wants to read them, not just students of the field. This, for me, is the biggest plus of the book - the fact that it piques the reader's curiosity on a very basic, childish level. Which is a surprisingly good feeling to revisit! :) Relatively minor crib-points for me, about the book are: - The narrative itself is overtly American centric. Which is OK, but cannot not be noticed, and occasionally, the reader wonders whether JD ever considered the possibility that a non-American would read his book. - The term ""Islam"" is used constantly in the book, as a geographic term, denoting the regions under Islamic empires at a particular point in time. I found this mildly irritating because these small things DO jump out at me (and also because of the number of times this was repeated).Moving on now to what in the book caused me actual disappointment: the Indian subcontinent is conspicuous by its exclusion. I recognize that the scope of this book is very ambitious: attempting to summarise millenia of human history - from the evolution of the first human beings to the state of the world today (more or less) is no mean feat. And LOTS of details are going to be left out, more for lack of space than anything else. I get that, I truly do.But I also find it puzzling that a very relevant topic was excluded, which would take only a few pages of text. Especially when so much of writing space has been spent on repeating other points and delving into disproportionate detail regarding outlier islands (the entire section on Lapita pottery could have been cut short with little loss to the reader's take-away knowledge)This exclusion stands out even more when there is an entire chapter dedicated to describing Chinese homogeneity, north-south migrations within China, the Austronesian expansion through Indonesia, to Australia and even all the way to Madagascar. In this discussion about China, its languages and people, Sri Lanka is mentioned as being a neighbour to China: Diamond seems to have skipped out a whole country in the middle! I will admit my natural bias for wanting to know the role the Indian subcontinent played in this entire chain of events. Having said that though, my curiosity stems from the knowledge that the subcontinent's location put it in the thick of things: inextricably linked with Eurasia, where all the action (read: advancement in technology right from food production & animal domestication to the rise of civilizations, writing, and other inventions) was happening. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to discuss trade routes, and cultural & technological exchanges across this region, both land routes, as well as sea routes.There is a brief mention in passing that India may have been one of the possible routes for the initial settlers of Madagascar to have reached there from the islands in the far east (as a direct voyage of that distance is unsupported by technologies in existence at the time). But that's as much of a mention that the peninsular coastline gets. Which is a shame, because that omitted discussion had the potential to enrich the reader's understanding of common cultural and linguistic practices across the region which exist even today, which can be traced back to this. Another reason I would have liked to see a discussion on the subcontinent (I know I am saying a lot on this subject, but I do have reason) is because it illustrates Diamond's hypothesis of ""Optimal Fragmentation"" of societies. A bit of background about this: Diamond addresses the question of why China, with its huge head start over western Europe didn't maintain and leverage its lead in later centuries. He discusses the fragmentation of Europe into various states, and its role in fostering competition. According to Diamond, China's being united, which was initially an advantage for the spread of language, also became the cause for its decelerated growth (or degrowth even, during the ironically termed Cultural revolution) after the 1400s.Thus, the concept of geographic fragmentation's role is discussed in some detail towards the end of the book. But it is only in the Afterword, that he addresses (again, in passing) the question of ""too much fragmentation"" retarding growth, citing the Indian subcontinent as an example highlighting this scenario. This is a question which I would've liked to see discussed in more depth (at least more mention than a single paragraph-worth). As a child, this was one of the questions that puzzled me: why, with so much of advancement in science and technology in the historic times, did it come to pass that India was colonized by European powers, and not the other way around? On a similar note, another question I would've liked to have seen discussed in further detail is that of the decline of the Fertile Crescent. This topic was also dealt with very briefly, in the Afterword. But this is a question bound to strike most readers of the book - simply because of the extent of the contrast that begs to be explained. How did the fertile crescent - that cradle of civilization, which had led the human race for many centuries in terms of cultural and technological advancement - how did it descend into the harsh, infertile, war-torn land that it is now? The variations of this region demands attention owing to the sheer extremes of the scenarios it has witnessed.Despite my complaints, I am much better off having read the book, and would want to read up even more on the topic now. Which is the effect any good book would have :)In addition, I have now officially added to my wish-list the following items: - A Globe, a nice spinning one ;)- An atlas with font as big and friendly as possible"
1475,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/860791-monica,4,"I had to write a paper on this book for my first class in graduate school. I am going to look to see if I still have it...hold on...I am totally pasting it in:“I’ve set myself the modest task of trying to explain the broad pattern of human history, on all the continents, for the last 13,000 years.” While Diamond’s explanation of his prize-winning book’s goal is clearly oversimplified, the impetus for writing the book is not: while doing research in New Guinea, a native friend named Yali asked him “Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [metal tools, weaponry, the material stuff of civilization], but we black people had little cargo of our own?”	While many scientists in the past have rushed to answer Yali’s question with the overtired answer of “race,” Diamond takes another route. He claims the differences in the long-term histories of people from around the world have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves, but rather their varied environments. Diamond backs his thesis up with examples like that of the Moriori people. In 1835 the Moriori, who lived on Chatham Island, 500 miles south of New Zealand, were attacked and brutally slaughtered by 500 Maori who arrived on their island by boat. Though the Moriori outnumbered the Maori by more than two to one, they were peaceable hunter-gatherers who were entirely inexperienced at war, lacked strong leadership and access to even the simplest technology. What makes this encounter interesting is that both groups were descendants from a common ancestor. Several Maori people had broken away and settled Chatham Island hundreds of years earlier. During the time they lived apart both groups evolved in different directions, with the Maori on mainland New Zealand embracing complex technology while the Moriori on Chatham Island did not; they remained hunter-gatherers while the Maori followed a lifestyle of intensive farming.	Diamond often cites Polynesia as a “natural experiment” because a variety of different islands – all with different levels of isolation, climate, productivity and geological and biological resources – were colonized by the same founding population, much like Chatham Island was. However, despite their ability to trace the same bloodline, these populations diverged. Diamond goes on to explain that these different populations, all biologically the same, went on to develop different technology at different rates, the most important of those being farming and domesticating plants and animals. Farming was essential to accumulating food and storing surplus, thus allowing non-food producing specialists (those in the military, in government, etc) to move the society ahead rather than keeping it in a constant hunter-gatherer state. Diamond, who has spent many years doing research in Polynesia, highlights examples where societies on some islands capitalized on their environment while others were hindered by what they found on theirs.	Readers have to wait until the end of the book to get some of the juiciest bits of information pertaining to more recent history. The chapter “The Future of History as a Science” (described as “alone worth the price of admission” by the Los Angeles Times) expands on topics like why Europe ended up dominating the New World when China, India and the Fertile Crescent region had, by all rights, taken the lead thus far economically, technologically and ecologically. By pointing out the smallest of decisions that lead to the biggest of mistakes – a power struggle between two factions in China led to the grounding of their enormous fleet and the dismantling of shipyards, paving the way for Europeans and the bumbling Christopher Columbus to discover America – Diamond easily shows how countries that appeared to have all the advantages or “head starts” as he calls them could fall behind. This chapter also delves into the fascinating effects and almost-effects of what he calls “idiosyncratic people” – where one person could have and at times in fact did sway the course of history. For example, what if Hitler had been killed, rather than simply wounded, in an assassination attempt in 1944? Or better yet, what if Hitler had been killed in a car accident that took place in 1930? If the driver of a truck that had collided with Hitler’s vehicle had hit his brakes a fraction of a second later, “the form of an eventual World War II would probably have been quite different…” Through these examples, Diamond discusses how such individual idiosyncrasies throw wild cards into the course of history. After reading chapter upon chapter that shows the smallest of changes taking place over 13,000 years or more, “The Future of History as a Science” provides a nice dichotomy to the earlier parts of Guns, Germs, and Steel.	If there is a flaw with Diamond’s award-winning book, it is the overwhelming amount of time covered in the book as well as a windfall of information for the reader to digest. While his examples support his beliefs, at times Diamond can get wordy in his explanations. The Los Angeles Times got it right by saying “reading Diamond is like watching someone riding a unicycle, balancing an eel on his nose and juggling five squealing piglets” – he gets your attention, but sometimes the massive amount of information can be overpowering.	Diamond himself is the first to admit that compressing 13,000 years of history on all continents into a 400-page book can be oversimplifying human history. But he also hopes it makes others interested in the challenge of developing that history as a science. And this book proves to be the perfect springboard."

It is a book that everyone should read but might not want to. I am in grad school and have to read several books at a time. This was the book I chose for my light reading outside of class, lol. Diamond traces the origins of civilization from the Fertile Cresent to every corner of the world and his results are well researched, scholarly, and important. I did find however, that the book could be quite dry. The book is around 400 pages but it felt more like a book more than double that length. "
1477,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,5,"This book amazes me for not only a brilliant exploration of human history, but for how easily and succinctly this theory can be explained. Super short version: It’s all happenstance and geography.The entire book in five hundred words or less: Cultures dominated other cultures mainly by means of a few variables: superior weapons, immunity to diseases, and on a broader scale technological and societal advancements unrelated to weapons. There are two important factors that set the stage for these conquests. Plant domestication and animal domestication.Plants: Every crop has attributes that make it either easier or harder to domesticate. Peoples who happened to live in areas with crops that were easier to domesticate were able to switch from a hunter gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary lifestyle. This allowed the birth rate to increase for a few reasons1)hunter gatherers have a limitation on how many young children can be carried over long distances2)the increase in food production associated with farming allowed populations to support more offspringAnimals: Similarly, animals have certain criteria that lend them be easier or harder to domesticate. Those peoples who happened to have domesticatable animals around were thus able to domesticate them. This not only provided populations with a valuable food source, but a valuable source of work energy to assist in agriculture. This combination of plant and animal domestication directly led to the following advantages by means of allowing a sedentary lifestyle with a surplus of food1)societies were able to support individuals not engaged in the struggle to find food. This includes examples such as government and bureaucracy, a military, and inventors2)societies were able to support highly dense populations3)due to a combination of issues regarding the sanitary nature of sedentary dense populations, as well as a close proximity to animals, early societies to adopt these lifestyles were prone to many diseases brought on by these afore mentioned things. While initially devastating this gave these people’s advantages in the future by creating populations genetically immune to many diseases.These conditions led to an environment fruitful to technological advancement, including writing, transportation, and weaponry. One last important aspect is the means by which information and materials were able to spread. This is the geographical axis that continents lie on. Information traveled quickly through Eurasia, but slowly or not at all in Africa and North and South America. This is because Eurasia runs on a East-West axis, where climate, day length, and seasons were similar, allowing for crops to flourish and ideas to spread easily. Geographical conditions in other continents created an impediment to materials and information traveling easily both due to the survivability of crops, as well as the ease of trade and travel between groups of people.All these factors combine to explain much of human history and development, a premium example of which is how Europeans were able to develop large boats to travel to the Americas to(instead of visa versa), accompanied by horses and weapons to decimate the native American peoples, as well as infect large amounts of those same people with diseases which the Europeans were mostly immune to but which also decimated native populations(due to their lack of domesticated animals this transfer occurred in only one direction). His detailed exploration of each culture's history in the latter half of the book is fascinating as well. "
1478,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Now that I’ve gotten into audiobooks, it’s always interesting to me to contemplate the difference between listening to a book and reading it visually. With a challenging book like this one, listening to it on audio has distinct advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, I was far more motivated to pick it up; instead of looking at the book as an intimidating demand on my energy and reading only a few pages at most before pushing it aside in favor of something lighter, I viewed it as a pleasant diversion during monotonous household tasks and devoted larger blocks of time to it than I otherwise might have. On the minus side, because I tend to listen to audiobooks while completing monotonous household tasks, my level of focus was compromised. That’s fine when I’m listening to escapist fluff; not so much when I’m actually trying to learn something from the book or think critically about its arguments.So it's no surprise that summarizing and critiquing Jared Diamond's arguments in this book is not an easy task for me, but I'll give it a shot. Basically, Jared asks that age-old question which I believe was similar to that posed by David Landes in “The Wealth and Poverty of Nations:” Why are some nations so powerful and others so weak? Rejecting the proposition that the stronger nations possess a genetically determined intellectual advantage, Jared discusses the progress of civilization from hunter-gatherers to food-producing farmers, the differential pace of that development throughout the world, and how that influenced later outcomes. Basically, continents with certain agricultural and ecological advantages were quicker to switch into food-production, which led to food surpluses and increased population density and ultimately to the development of both sophisticated weapons and germs/immunity, which gave these natives a physical advantage when conquering nations from other continents. Although I'm sure I've oversimplified and left stuff out, that, in a nutshell, is the book's thesis.Well, I'm not really sufficiently intelligent or knowledgeable to challenge these assumptions but I did wonder at times if Jared was being overly simplistic. Additionally, and I know this is my bias, as an Orthodox Jew I tend to maintain a creationist perspective. So many of Jared's theories were based on evolutionary assumptions stated as unequivocal facts, and while this didn't make these ideas less interesting, it did make them feel more abstract to me. With that said, the book was interesting and worth reading, in my opinion. Jared offers a great deal of information in an engaging way and gives the reader a lot to think about. "
1479,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"In the Prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes the book in a single sentence:History followed different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.His explanations of environmental differences around the world and their consequences on human life and development are detailed, informative, and quite credible. I read this book because I have always attributed the very different accomplishments of various races or ethnicities to differences in ability, intelligence, motivation, or organization. Diamond believes that such attitudes are racist and loathsome, so he set out to show that the environments in which people have developed are responsible for their situations. His knowledge is vast, his further research is thorough, and his analysis is honest and reasonable. He gives us every reason to believe that external conditions have determined the fate of human beings, rather than their biology, as he euphemistically calls their innate characteristics. In other words, he assumes that by showing that environmental conditions could account for differences, that they do completely account for them. From such an astonishingly learned and intelligent man, that seems like sophistry.A very apt quote appeared in the Wiring the Brain blog on May 29, 2018, attributed to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell:This is the difference between wanting to test something (good science) and wanting to find something (bad science).Mr. Diamond doesn't acknowledge the possibilities that racially or ethnically linked characteristics could have also contributed to differences in outcome, that cultural evolution could have added its mark, and that peoples could have evolved differently during the relatively brief history of Homo sapiens, in response to their situations and challenges. Surely we must take such possibilities into account."
1480,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,4,"Jared Diamond. professor of geography at UCLA, sets out to answer the question, Why has human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents? How do some people become victors, and others the vanquished? Why do some peoples develop guns, steel, technology, and ""civilization"" while others languish in ""barbarity""? Diamond says that ""probably the most commonest explanation involves implicitly or explicitly assuming biological differences among peoples."" Diamond explodes this racist explanation by convincingly arguing that it's people's environments, not biological differences among people themselves, that are the ultimate cause of these historical disparities. Simply put, some societies were more fortunate than others to find themselves in environments more conducive for food production (the domestication of plants and animals). Food production leads to denser human populations and food surpluses. Food surpluses can support non-producing specialists like kings, politicians, artisans, priests, scribes, and inventors. Dense populations and animals also are ripe for the spread of disease. Thus, food production leads to germs, guns, and steel. Societies with germs, guns, and steel lay waste to those without.Yali's question had occurred to me in the past, but I hadn't had the audacity to try to answer it. Diamond's theory is so comprehensive; truly, as the book's front cover brags, ""the scope and explanatory power of this book are astounding"" (The New Yorker). I'm very glad to have read this book. I give it 4*s instead of 5 because part 4 of the book became rather repetitive, and exhausted my endurance. "
1481,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,3,"Diamond's opening argument is a good one: the development of civilizations is based on geographical differences, not race/human biology. And that's how he concludes his book: the fate of societies is based on environments. But how he went from the argument to his conclusion is sometimes odd. For example, he raises an interesting question: In the early 1400s, why didn't the Chinese sail around the Cape of Good Hope and colonize Europe, or colonize the Americas over the Pacific? In other words, ""Why Europe, not China""? China, unlike Europe, was basically unified, and one decision made a huge impact. Eunuchs are identified as the group sending and captaining fleets. But the opponents of the Eunuchs gained power and stopped sending fleets: one simple decision. Then not much later in the book, (p.430 of the mass market paperback) Diamond asked the question again: ""Why Europe, not China"" and goes on to say ""I knew my readers would not let me get away... without saying anything about this obvious question."" But... he already had. Was his early assumption wrong? Diamond makes some interesting points: the east-west expansion of food production from the Fertile Crescent happened more quickly than the same north-south expansion in the Americas simply because the east-west expansion included the same type of climate. I didn't know about the mini ice age in the 1500s, and that the Norse colony in Greenland subsequently disappeared without a trace. Most of this book is an easy read except the part about languages and writing, a tough subject, ironically, for any writer. There seemed to be a great deal of repetition throughout the book. However, overall, I liked this work, it's an interesting read. "

Distinguished ecologist and physiologist Jared Diamond presents a novel synthesis of ecology with history; one which should be required reading for all historians. Without a doubt, ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" offers a unique perspective on the rise of Western civilization. Diamond urges historians to pay more attention as to how humanity's interactions with its local ecologies have shaped the course of history, offering persuasive evidence that Western Civilization's success is an accident due to its origins in the Near East's Fertile Crescent, which had a rich assemblage of animals and plants that were easy to domesticate. Other regions in the Americas and Asia were considerably poorer with regards to potentially domesticated animals and plants than the Fertile Crescent. He notes how the spread of the Fertile Crescent's domesticated animals across the globe, along with their associated diseases, made Western civilization's economic and political success almost inevitable. Much to his credit, Diamond concludes by offering suggestions as to how his elegant hypothesis can be tested by historians as well as scientists. He makes his compelling case with vivid, often eloquent, prose. This is one magnificent tome truly worthy of all the honors and awards it has earned so far. "
1483,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84933770-fikayo-adebolajo,4,"A throughly engaging and enlightening read.With this offering, Jared Diamond sets about explaining the various rates of development and rise of human societies across the globe. Taking the reader on an exciting journey through history, identifying factors that contribute to the disproportionate nature of development and advancement in the various continents and islands.Why was there such a disparate gap in the rate of development of Eurasian societies as compared with American, sub Saharan Africa and Australian societies? What factors stimulated the rise of complex systems of societal organizations and governmental structures around the world. Why did this rise occur in some regions and not others?Why did some states experience more success than many others?What gave some regions an advantage in achieving beneficial technologies that aided conquest?The author shows remarkable insight and employs an engaging writing style, in explaining how geography, climate, population density, culture and traditions, animal and plant specie distribution and many other factors came together to shape the course of events we are now becoming familiar with thanks to modern scientific methods.The author tackles this enormous task with expert skill, gradually laying down facts, explaining and synthesizing information from historical, archeological, molecular, and genetic evidence into a clear and sensible analogy of how human societies developed and shaped our modern world."

The question to be answered is why did the societies of Western Europe invade and conquer the indigenous people of North and South America? Or inversely, why didn't the tribes of North and South America conquer the people of Western Europe? The ground rules specify that the answer lies within the natural features of the land, and emphatically not with the racial characteristics of the conquerors or the conquered. To simplify a great deal (as Diamond does), the combined land mass of Europe and Asia had natural advantages. There were better animal candidates to domesticate such as the horse, sheep, and pig. There were larger grain cereals which led to the rise of agriculture and moved people away from hunter-gatherer societies. There were other topographical factors that favored Europe and Asia. OK. I can agree with that. The rise of farming ultimately led to surplus food, different roles for people, more complex societies, military technology and the ability to construct ships and conquer far off lands. Still, the whole premise seems somewhat oversimplified to me. What caused the aggressive behavior, the lust for power, and the brutal treatment of native peoples? I don't find a plausible answer in features of the landscape."
1485,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,4,"This was fascinating, at least to me. Diamond tackles the issue of why some societies have come out on top, historically speaking. Why did the Europeans conquer the American Indians, and not the other way around, for example? I'd heard a lot about this book, and it didn't disappoint. Diamond dives deep into many sciences: botany, current and historical; archeology; sociology; anthropological history; domesticated animals; technology; and resource distribution to name a few. He presents his theories and a great deal of research to back them up. There's a lot of science and some dry facts, so know that going in. But if you can wade through that, the ideas are compelling. What does a continent being mostly north/south oriented vs. east/west have to do with how a society advances? What can plants tell us about why some societies advanced? Where did the people who settled Madagascar come from? These and a lot of other questions get answered as Diamond moves through world history from several viewpoints on several different continents. It's not an adventure story, it's a long research paper. If you're ok with that, you can learn a LOT from this. I found it drawing me in. Very glad I read it. Recommended if you're ok with the cautions I mention above."

Just that the narrator was a bit dull, didn't feel like the right time, and I already know the gist of this book. Jared Diamond, while I like his theory, is too verbose for my tastes, and prattles on about things that could be covered with a quick summary. For example, his whole thing with the Spanish going over and conquering. Literally could have been covered in about five minutes. But he's going on about it for almost forty minutes.So, one day I'll read this. I like the theory -- even though I don't think it covers all the reasons why the Europeans came out on top -- just not my taste right now."

But man, am I glad to be finished. It was slow and dense, almost painfully so, and I can't really say that I enjoyed it.

1490,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53002487-coachjim,5,"Guns, Germs, and Steelby Jared DiamondThis is not light reading. The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and wonders why did the countries of Europe conquer and colonize the Americas and not the Native Americans conquer and colonize Europe. He later rephrases it again as why didn’t Africa conquer Europe and import Native Americans to work as slaves.Thus begins a very interesting analysis.The author deals with the Racism issue early in the book. He attributes any appearance of more “intelligence” as a product of the environment and is not biological.
The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking. 
(Page 19)Differences in intelligence are more attributable to social environment and educational opportunities than to biological reasons.(It’s been a while since I read it but The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould deals with this question quite well.)The title of the book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” serves as a shorthand for the reasons Europeans conquered the natives of the New World instead of Native Americans colonizing Europe. The immediate reasons are the technology employed by the Europeans based of guns, steel weapons, and horses, the germs they brought with them to the New World, the ships that allowed them to cross the oceans, the centralized political organization of European states, and the communication gained through writing.A major part of his argument is that the production of food allowed these civilizations to advance. Once food was available people no longer needed to be hunting and gathering each day. The domestication of plants and animals allowed people to settle down in one place and provided them the stability to develop better ways of living.This domestication of plants required that the plant have certain characteristics making it a reliable source of food. It also needed a climate that allowed the plants to grow. Out of all the plants available in a location not all of them had the needed requirements. Likewise all locations did not have the qualifying climate.The same held true for animals. Very few animals have ever been domesticated. Even over the last few thousand years there are no new domesticated animals. He attributes this to the Anna Karenina principle.
To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. 
(Page 169).It is pointed out that in terms of conquering an area nothing matched germs and their accompanying diseases. More people were killed by germs and the diseases they caused than by any military campaign.The germs themselves were not something that resulted from some creative design. The author points out frequently that agriculture and its accompanying settlements created an ideal laboratory for germs. Especially living in close proximity with animals. He also says that living in dense populated areas helped the germs spread their diseases, but also helped people develop immunities. It was these immunities that the Native Americans lacked when the disease was brought to the Americas.The author emphasizes the importance of continents in the spread of advances in civilizations. His analysis deals with each continent individually. An important part is the axis of a continent. For the purposes of this book he combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia. Eurasia with its East/West axis facilitated the spread of technology and food production because the area shared the same latitude. That meant the plants and animals from one area weren’t subject to huge changes in environment from one part of the continent to another.Likewise people, plants and animals in the Americas and in Africa had to travel through and survive various climates from any travels along the axis of those continents.One of the questions the author brings up is why did Europe conquer so much of the world and not China. China had a long head start in the development of food and especially technology. One of the reasons is the early unification of the people of China under one government. The resulting authoritarian rule prevented the competition of ideas. That was not the case in Europe where several small states competed with each other for dominance. There any development which gave one state an advantage over another was quickly exploited.While reading this I was arguing with myself (I won) about whether this was a “History” book. I felt that it is important to understand the founding of the civilizations that I read about. At the end of the book the author himself makes this argument about whether history is a science. He states that to some “History is just one damn fact after another.” In this book the author is using archeology, linguistics and genetics to make his case.This book is the first of a trilogy. While I was reading this I doubted I would tackle the next one anytime soon. Learning this much is fatiguing. But this was an enjoyable and enlightening book so I will be getting the next one, Collapse, soon."
1491,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r,3,"Not quite what I was expecting. Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former. It's an interesting premise, though."
1492,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71152033-matija,2,"It’s been a few years since I read Guns, Germs and Steel. If my memory serves me well, Diamond is expatiating on a theory (geographic determinism) that has been in decline for decades, yet the points are presented so convincingly that one is inclined to believe the (seemingly) logical connections. I am in no position to invalidate geographic determinism as a theory, because I do not have extensive knowledge on that subject and the theory is not even fully rejected in academia. What I can do, as a geographer, is shed light on some of the claims, which Diamond seemingly cherrypicked to support his attempt at explaining the evolution through geographic determinism, and which I believe are wrong or too restrained. Given the immensity of the task Diamond has bestowed upon himself, generalisations are inevitable, and as such, erring.For example, he wrote: ""Within Europe, England and France and Spain and Portugal founded worldwide colonial empires but Switzerland and Poland and Greece did not, because of equally straightforward geographic reasons: the former countries did, and the latter countries did not, have Atlantic Ocean ports.""It would be sensible to compare England, France, Spain and Portugal to China - another great power whose society has been concentrated along the coast throughout history. Diamond doesn’t answer why, for example, the Chinese didn’t use their big ass ships (junks) during the relatively peaceful period in Ming dynasty (specifically 1400-1433) to establish country-sized colonies like the Western European nations did a few centuries later. Chinese naval expeditions, which went as far as Africa and Indonesia during the Ming dynasty, are well documented, but somehow conquering those far-flung corners of the world didn’t interest them that much. Perhaps one could argue this lack of interest in establishing colonies persisted in China because in a Confucian world order merchants were considered to be among the lowliest members of society, but that is closer to being a reason pertaining to possibilism or at least probabilism, not determinism.I’d like to see this Chinese reluctance to expand in a colonial manner explained by geographic determinism. Diamond also seems to hugely generalise and say rash things such as (paraphrasing) ""Europe has invented farming before Africa did"" and ""East-West biomes have a congenital advantage over North-South biomes"", in spite of the fact that several civilisations expanded in the N-S manner and the largest E-W biome on Earth-- the Eurasian ""Heartland"" with intermittent mountain ranges and vast areas of tundra, taiga and steppe -- has for the most part been a huge brake on civilisational progress, not a boon to it.There’s also some hinting at jewish superiority that is unnecessary and does not support the main idea of the book. This all leads me to believe that Diamond’s intention was not to write a thorough analysis of socio-economic developments nested in geographic determinism, but instead, he rather aimed at flattening the belief that European conquests and consequential dominance were due to superiority, a viewpoint that dissipated from academia sometime in the second half of the 20th century. A quick look through a variety of online platforms that discuss said work reflect that this is indeed how most people interpret it. This has caused confusion because criticism aimed at geographic determinism is quite normal, and naturally it wasn’t any different with Guns, Germs and Steel, but zealous supporters of Mr. Jared Diamond see any criticism as an attack on the idea that European dominance was not due to inherent superiority. This draws the attention of people who base their arguments on their emotional preference rather than logic, and the water becomes even muddier.Tl;dr: GG&S is a book equivalent of clickbait."
1493,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"After talking about this book for a decade as if I had read it, I finally actually did. I was not disappointed. The biggest take-away for me was that I think this finally pushed me over the edge and I do not believe the Book of Mormon is historical. This is a big deal for an active, largely believing Mormon like me. What did it was the discussion and overview on the development and spread of writing. Diamond never mentions anything about the historical claims of Mormonism. He simply talks about the historical record regarding writing--which is voluminous and clear. By ""clear"" I don't mean that we know everything about all historical writing, but rather that there is a very developed archaeological science regarding writing with well established and accepted findings. We know a lot. The Book of Mormon purports to tell the story of three groups that leave the Near East and come to the North/South America. The Jaredites stretch from the Tower of Babel to about 600 BCE. The Nephites and Mulekites are two groups that leave Jerusalem in approximately 600 BCE right before and after the destruction of the Temple. They all cross paths somewhere in the Americas. It is a fantastic story, of course, but I was raised in the traditional belief structure that it really happened and accepted it as such throughout my life. Until now.These peoples reached a population in excess of a million by the end, with many millions of people along the way. These people were highly literate and placed great value on studying old scripture and creating new scripture. The Book of Mormon starts out with the story of Nephi killing a man in order to get his scriptural records because having them to teach and pass down was more important than a single man's life. Many of the Book of Mormon Prophets quote other Prophets from generations and even centuries past. Kings give speeches and command that they be written down and distributed. Christ appears and tell them to write down other things and then they live in peace and prosperity for 200 years and teach all their children the scriptures. The Book of Mormon tells of rooms full of records engraved into metal plates compiled and abridged and edited down to what we now have as the Book of Mormon.The point is that the Book of Mormon tells of a large, highly literate population living for literally thousands of years somewhere in the Americas. But there is not a single instance of a single writing that has been found that could have possibly been from the peoples of the Book of Mormon.It is just not credible that for such a populous and literate people for all their writings to have either been all been destroyed or are not yet been discovered and are are yet waiting to be found. It is possible, but just not likely. As in extremely unlikely. Too unlikely for intelligent people to believe is the case.So, the book was informative and interesting and well written, but it's impact on me was far more profound than being just educational. The Book of Mormon still contains many beautiful truths and great moral teachings. I love the Psalm of Nephi, Alma Sr.'s words at the Waters of Mormon, Alma Jr.'s recounting of his conversion to his sons, Moroni's testimony of the dangers of our time. Lots and lots of scripture in there. I love the Book of Mormon. But I don't think it is history. Kind of like the book of Genesis.And that is what I got out of Guns, Germs and Steel. I'm no longer a literal Book of Mormon believer. "
1494,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"One of my favourite books in recent times has been Sapiens - it did a fantastic job of showing how the species ascended to the apex position in evolutionary biology. A vertical journey, so to speak. But why didn't all humans, spread across various continents, develop equally in terms of civilisation and technology? To use the book's blurb, ""why has human history unfolded so differently across the globe?"" In the modern world, why does an Africa or even a large part of Asia have to work hard to catch up with the western world? That's what the book seeks to answer.It does that by asking very interesting questions. For instance, why is it that the Spanish conquered South American empires, and not the other way? The book doesn't stop at the proximate answers - horses, weapons, germs etc- but keeps asking a series of questions for the answers that come up. Even beyond the time that recorded human history begins. To when the species first made their appearance on the planet - in Africa- and how slowly they made their way to different parts of the globe. Primarily, four factors have ultimately caused the disparity in the fortunes of various peoples- how early they started, the difference in the environment and biogeography of the areas they populated (what plants and animals there could be domesticated to scale up food production and create the surplus needed for new skills and ideas to develop), the spread of ideas (the fascinating aspect of how the axis of the continent - except for Eurasia, all continents have a north south axis - plays a large role in why a large number of major civilisations and developments occurred in this part of the world), and the densities of population that allowed competing societies within continents to come up with radical ideas. In addition, there are also related interesting ideas. For example, how invention is actually the mother of necessity (examples of how some inventions had been made before, but are credited to the person/s who made the right tweak at the right time for others to adopt it in large numbers) and how some non-intuitive solutions have endured (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).All of this make for a fascinating, if not easy read. Even though it was published a couple of decades ago, I think it is an important book for this time because it shows how evolutionary determinism is not just about genes, but the environment as well. P.S. I do wish he had spent some pages on how the British could conquer India. The only clue he does drop is how India's environment might have created a caste system which prevented the creation and proliferation of ideas it otherwise might have had. "
1495,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"Two people recommended this book to me on two separate occasions, so I was eager to read it. While the book turned out to be as thought-provoking as I had hoped, the writing left something to be desired.Jared Diamond has a compelling thesis and offers good arguments to support it, including numerous figures, charts, maps, and dates. However, in his zeal for such statistics, he often forgets about the coherency of the writing, and it suffers. The book reads more like lengthy scientific essay than a non-fiction book aimed at the general public. That doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down either--the tone and coherence of the writing just needs work. I found much of the book repetitive and dull enough that I just wanted to skip ahead until I found a ""more interesting"" section.For instance, I realize that the uneven distribution of domesticable animals and plants is a major part of Diamond's thesis. However, he reiterates this point to the extent that he is beating a dead horse (or, if in South America, a dead llama). He also fixates much on the Austronesian islands, such as New Guinea, and I wonder if part of that comes from a bias having spent much time researching there.Other portions of the book are interesting and eye-opening, however. I particularly liked the section on the development of writing (Chapter 12) and the detail he went into there. The part on the origins of various diseases was also fascinating. Even the chapter where he discusses the racial distribution of Africa and compares various languages is great, if you can gloss over some of the technical aspects of the discussion.Diamond raises some points that I had never before considered, such as the major axes of the continents--it makes sense, in retrospect, that it's easy to transport crops across longitude, because the climate does not change as much as transporting crops across latitude. That makes sense.Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel is a worthy book. Those heavily-inclined toward academics could do worse. It suffers somewhat from the heavy-handed writing style of the author, but this is not going to stop me from reading another one of his books (I think I'll try 
Collapse
 next)."

And specifically by way of explaining Europe's dominance as an accident of environment – species availability, geography, that sort of thing – rather than anything inherent to its peoples or, just as often, anything inherently inferior about the native populations of the rest of the globe.Hmm. An ambitious project, and I'm glad I read it, but. But this is one of those books where I'm reading, I'm interested, we're good. And then I start getting a feeling, just a niggle, like there's something I'm not seeing. And then it slowly dawns on me and I go, "". . . wait . . . wait, no. Really?""What I wasn't seeing here were proper citations. I assumed at first this was an artifact of the audiobook, since they maddeningly cut non-substantive footnotes. (I usually get an e-text to check later, if I am curious. Which I'm me, so I generally am.) But when I checked here, nope, almost nothing.But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was that when I paid close attention to what he said textually about his sources . . . holy shitballs, guys. Are you fucking kidding me? This dude wrote a book discussing clashes between more advanced societies and less advanced societies, drawing largely from primary sources embedded in the victorious society, and it never occurred to him that this was a problem. Wow.And separately, I am totally into these projects that promote social justice agendas orthogonally, like arguing against racism by talking about the impact of continental geography on technological development. But I'm always happier when it's clear the author can engage with the meat of the issue if he wants to. And Diamond is, um, still in racism 101. Like, he's against it, everybody! Racism bad! But let's all pause to romanticize indigenous tribal people and talk about how the simplicity of their lives makes them happier than white people. Ug.So short version: a really interesting project, but Diamond lost a huge amount of credibility with me from start to finish."
1497,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest,4,"Why did the Europeans become the dominant force of colonization in the late 13th century? Why not the Incans, or the Chinese? Mr. Diamond takes on some real root cause explorations in his 1997 treatise, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Ultimately, he debunks any ethnic superiority concept, instead contending that it was the environmental factors in the “Fertile Crescent” of SW Asia that gave the Europeans a head start and leg up on all of the other civilizations.Diamond contends that a switch from a hunter-gatherer to a farming economy is required to jump start civilization, allowing for the development of specialists thereby creating the economic and technologic growth necessary for further advancement. The Fertile Crescent, he claims, was uniquely positioned to make this transition first, with an ideal combination of native plants and animals for domestication, and a geography ideal for the rapid dissemination and spread of these advances, ultimately to nearby Europe. Other areas in the world, Mesoamerica, the Incas, and China in particular, were also able to make this jump, but SW Asia was blessed with the attributes to do so first and quickest.The Europeans with this head start, were then able in the 13th century to bring their guns and germs out into the rest of the world, dominating and ultimately decimating the native populations.This is a well researched and convincing book. Diamond makes his arguments cogently and in excruciating detail, often to the point that the reader gets overwhelmed and weary. He explores biology, genetics, microbiology, linguistic genealogy, metallurgy, crop science, anthropology, archeology, geology and a host of other hard and not so hard sciences as he makes his case. There is a lot to this book, but it gets redundant and his continued use of numbered lists gets tiresome.So I have to give this book 4 stars: convincing and instructive, but a bit of a chore to read."
1498,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"Very interesting and worthwhile -- won a Pulitzer. I might have found it difficult to read -- the audible version was abridged, and even then the first half was a bit dry, devoted to paleolithic plant ecology and the like. But then it 'heats' up, so to speak.His basic question is why did Eurasia develop higher forms of civilization, and not Africa or the Americas or Oceania. He does not want to use (for good reason) biological explanations -- and probably finds (as I do) political/economic explanations (colonialism/exploitation/etc.) too facile -- and seeks to explain it by means of geographical and ecological factors... going back to the paleolithic period.Basically -- domesticated food production began in the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia) -- and then independently in China -- and from there spread throughout Eurasia. Because plants are adapted to certain latitudes (length of day, seasons, etc.), the spread laterally and not longitudinally. Hence, cultivation spread to the Atlantic and to the Pacific but, once it cross the Mediterranean to North Africa, could not travel further south. The same holds for the domestication of animals -- and since pandemic germs derive from the Eurasians' close habitation with animals, who then developed immunities, they spread easily among the peoples of the New World, who had no such immunities. From domestication came settled life, urban life, highly developed forms of social organization, technology ( -- technology requires settled life, since nomads can't carry water-wheels on their back --) and... hence, guns.It is a very reasonable argument -- and was worth the couple of hours of listening.One striking example of the difficulty of longitudinal dispersion -- not just of plants, but of culture -- is that the Mayans had the wheel and the Incas (1200 km south) had domesticated llamas, and for thousands of years the twain never met.I am not sure how I will feel about this book 6 months from now or 6 years from now -- so I will withhold judgment. (on audible...)"
1499,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,5,"What a book!This book is all about life. About how we came to be. About how the current world situation came to be. Jared Diamond really took on a tough task of explaining how ""now"" came to be, but he did it seemingly effortless. His wide-range of knowledge in different fields provides a lot of insights. As ""modern"" people, we too often forget our roots, how we got to this stage, and that we are actually not as great or advanced as our ancestors. I think everyone should read this book, before reading the bible or quran or any other book that tries to explain humankind. Diamond's main argument is that the world's natural environment shaped us humans and led to the developments that created our current situation (colonialism, spread of certain languages, why the ""West"" is rich and other countries poor,...). He ties everything in very smoothly and in an interesting manner. I didn't know that humans destroyed the megafauna in Australia and Americas when they reached those places, simply because the animals in those regions were not used to seeing humans compared with animals in Africa and Eurasia that could develop fear and escape mechanisms. Simply because of this fact, it was difficult for people in Australia and America to develop food production in a pastoral sense, which would inevitably lead to writing, technological development and what not.Some people complained that the book title isn't appropriate, because he doesn't only talk about Guns, Germs and Steel. I think we should understand that the book title was probably chosen due to its catchiness and maybe the publisher liked it. He talks a lot about germs, then about guns and less about steel, but how else would you title this book?Nevertheless, it's a very interesting read. I love the fact that he focused a lot on New Guinea, Australia and Polynesia. Those areas fascinate me. Geography can really explain everything, but does this still hold true for the Internet age? "
1500,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054464-john,1,"This was an utter bore. In all honesty, the points of this book could be better learned by playing Sid Meier's Civilization series.Mr. Diamond starts with a question (framed by a question from a New Guinean friend as to why white people are materially richer) and comes up with an answer that can be explained in a page or two. Yet, Mr. Diamond devotes over 400 pages to discussing stuff. The book is extremely repetitive, as he keeps reminding the reader of his conclusions in previous chapters, and runs through crop histories for pages on end. Reading the last chapter is enough to obtain an understanding of Guns, Germs, and Steel.Basically, the world is divided into Eurasia on one end, and the Americas, Africa, and Oceana at the other end. Because Eurasia is so big from east to west without insurmountable barriers, it had more mammals and crops capable of domestication, and had a better way of diffusing crop and animal domestication (and, in turn, technology) to other societies in relative climates. By contrast, the rest of the world didn't, since their north-south narrowness creates too many diverse climates for diffusing crops, or they faced too many geographic barriers. This takes 400 pages of explaining, somehow. Without crops and animals, societies in the other parts of the world didn't have huge population jumps, resistance to diseases from animals, or advanced technology. The end.Mr. Diamond admits that he doesn't explain why only Western Eurasia came to dominate the world instead of the other societies in Eurasia, then he proceeds to an explanation for a few pages (that would've been a more interesting topic). To sum up his final theory, Europe was less integrated, but integrated enough to compete with one another technologically. China was too integrated, and Mesopotamia killed their trees and became a desert. Well, golly."

In case this question immediately makes you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatise, you aren't: as you will see, the answers to the question don't involve human racial differences at all. The book's emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back the chain of historical causation as far as possible.Science writing just doesn't get any better than this. Everyone should read this book. It explains why some societies advanced more rapidly than others and the differences between the victors and the vanquished. I don't know if Professor Diamond came up with all of these brilliant observations, but he gets credit for writing the best book about them. I have given this book to at least a half dozen of my friends and relatives. You're welcome.After reading a couple of one and two star reviews I’ve noticed that they all seem to point towards some sort of racism in this book. These days unless you aren’t calling someone else a racist then obviously you are a racist. Is that about it? A lot of people said the book was boring or poorly written. I didn’t find that to be true, quite the opposite. I’ve read it twice. The ideas put forth in this book were novel to me and make complete sense. If there is a better way to explain the course of history it’s still waiting for me to find it. The critics never post another work we all should be reading. I learned an awful lot about plant and animal domestication and his theory of how geography played such an important part in human development was brilliant. "
1502,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/715626-joe,4,"As another reviewer has pointed out, the only thing the matter with this book is the title. It should really be called Germs, Agriculture, and Geographical Positioning. I can see why they went with the later but there is precious little discussion of guns or steel anywhere in the book.That being said, a very interesting read. Here is the essential thesis:“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.""This book is a great answer to the racist notions that european culture ""won"" over other cultures because they were superior, either physically or intellectually. The simple fact is that the different climates led to different germs, crops, and domesticated animals. All of these factors led to how easy a society became ""civilized."" It's as simple as that but a lot of the things Diamond brought up had never occurred to me.This book explains why we don't:- Have Hunting Cheetahs- Eat Lion Burgers- Grow acorns and eat them- Why the new world died from european diseases and not the other way aroundInteresting stuff but not quite the breathtaking game changer it had been built up to be."

This book provides a good antidote for racist or supremacist theories about the differences in development of different societies and a solid base for refutation of heroic narratives that distort history.Germs, for instance, were one of the major weapons that conquerers had, when they collided with native peoples. In some cases, 90% and more of the invaded were killed by a disease brought by the invading army.Jared Diamond writes about the differences the continents had that made plant and animal domestication initiate and develop at very different speeds. And goes on to show the effect that had on the cultures that arose after food production and domestic animals allowed for bigger populations, and more complex societies."

In many ways, what we end up with is an ambitious ""theory"" of world history derived from first-principles.Fair warning, the book is heavy on details about the histories of specific crops and so on which gets a bit dull for the casual reader, but if the premise is at all interesting to you, you will come out the other end feeling a lot less mystified about the large-scale course of world history.PS: See CGP Grey's ""Americapox: The Missing Plague"" video at https://youtu.be/JEYh5WACqEk for a really good summary of the ""germs"" part of this book."

Spanning the period since the beginnings of animal domestication and settled agriculture, it attempts to answer the question as to why particular regions of the globe developed when they did, socio-economically speaking, and why others never developed societies more advanced than hunter-gatherers. Diamond, a professional scientist and amateur historian, adduces a plausible argument based on environmental givens, an hypothesis with a great carrying capacity.This environmentally-deterministic study is counterbalanced by his later work, Collapse, which treats of the matter of the success and failure of human societies. Here social practices, human behaviors, are determinative, but once again in terms of environmental givens.The subtext to both volumes, what I read into them throughout, was an argument against genetic determinism--in other words, against racism.

The answer seems to come down to the ability to produce food through agriculture, which in turn allows for greater population density and faster innovation. Diamond acknowledges the influences of elements like politics, culture, and the Great Man theory, but notes how much less impact these had than environmental factors. Admittedly I lost steam on this one because of the repetition of tracing environmental factors through several regions of the world, but the cases presented were interesting and convincing."

The author builds a very convincing case of how Eurasia became quite different from say, the Americas or Africa in terms of technology and immunity to major diseases in 1500 which enabled them to conquer most parts of the world.

1522,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,3,"Guns, Germs, and Steel is basically an answer to the question, ""If Europeans aren't innately superior, why did they end up running everything for so long?"" Or, in the words of a New Guinean given in the beginning of the book:Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?For me, the best metaphor to frame the whole book in is in terms of a game of Civilization. And while I'm sure most anthropologists and ethnologists are even now launching themselves at the screen with their hands reaching for my neck, I'll lay out my case. Civilization IV has a lot of problems as an accurate model of human history and societal interaction (for example, technology as a tree), but it does demonstrate a lot of Diamond's points.For example, locally available resources. In Civilization IV, if you don't have any sulfur, you can't make gunpowder. If you don't have gunpowder, you'll get steamrolled by any civilization who does unless you trade for it--and if you do that, you're at the mercy of the civilization that's providing it for you, and G-d help you if they declare war on you, because you'll lose your ability to make gunpowder units and get stomped.Second, trade. Civilizations that trade technological innovations often advance much faster than a single civilization that tries to turtle up and go Galt (which is my usual strategy...), and it's not unusually to end up behind the tech curve and run into a cavalry vs. tanks situation when expanding out beyond your traditional borders.Third, terrain. Mountains blocking expansion and trade are bad. Starting in the jungle is bad. Lack of natural resources are bad. Small islands are bad. Deserts are bad. All of those make expansion much more difficult and limit your population, which reduces the rate of your technological progress, so you advance slower, have less to trade, and eventually your cavalry gets steamrolled by tanks.There are plenty of points Guns, Germs, and Steel makes that Civilization simply doesn't cover, though, lest you think that playing a video game will provide the same educational experience. For one, disease vectors--a.k.a., why didn't the Europeans get wiped out by super plagues from the Americas? The simple answer is animals. The Eurasian civilizations lived in very close proximity to animals for most of their existence and most of the really serious diseases that affected humans in the past--smallpox, black plague, flu, and so on--were originally animal diseases that made the jump. The cultures in the Americans simply did not have the same range of animals as the Eurasian cultures did, so they had little exposure to animal-borne diseases and hence little resistance to them, and therefore both died in droves and did not inflict a similar fate on Europeans. The popular image of North America as a pristine wilderness is wrong--it wasn't a wilderness, it was a post-apocalyptic wasteland.Though as an interesting note, Diamond points out that when syphillis first appeared, it was a horrific disease that literally caused people's flesh to rot off and killed in months. It mutated shortly after its initially appearance into the insanity-causing, long-term disease we know today, however, and so Europe never experienced The Years of Rice and Salt.(note that whether syphillis actually came from the Americas is still somewhat controversial)Similarly, Civilization doesn't have climate bands, but they were hugely important in world history. Eurasia is oriented east-west, with a similar latitude and climate the whole length, and a contiguous land route to travel along, so it was easy for animals and plants tamed in one place (mostly the Middle East) to spread all along that climactic band to each of those civilizations. In contrast, the Americas are oriented north-south, with desert or mountain barriers in places, and Australia and Oceania have large expanses of water making trade harder and populations smaller in addition to latitude differences. It was difficult to get crops from one place to another, and because it took longer, there was a lower population for a longer time, which reduced the potential for innovation due to a lower possible number of inventors, thus leading to a technological gap which, in combination with the smallpoxalypse, led to the cultural and physical near-extermination of the Native Americans.That part, at least, is familiar to players of Civilization. More food means more people, which means more science and production, which means faster advancement, and it all feeds into each other until you're the ones with tanks stomping everyone else.Okay, enough about Civilization. Anyway, that's Diamond's theory, but there are a few problems with Guns, Germs, and Steel.For one, it is incredibly dry and boring. I often had to force myself to keep reading, and I'd get a few more pages in before I got distracted by something new and interesting. At least twice, I almost fell asleep while I was reading it. There are other reviews mentioning that it took them up to six months to finally finish the entire book, so be warned.Second, there are no footnotes. For a book like this, I'd expect dozens of pages of footnotes meticulously documenting all his assumptions, but that never happens, and it's much to the book's detriment.Third, for a book about why Europeans dominated the world, it's mostly focused on the far past--as Diamond phrases it, on the question I quoted at the beginning of the review. The actual process of domination isn't covered at all except for a brief section about the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas.Finally, and most damningly, the section at the end where Diamond talks about China actually serves to lever open the cracks in his argument. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, China and the Middle East were far more advanced than Europe was, and they also lie in the same Eurasian climactic band that Diamond proposes gave the civilizations within a competitive advantage. So, why is it that neither of them conquered everyone? Diamond has two explanations for this. For China, he claims that China's more continuous government worked against it, because it was possible for the government to ban sea exploration (as actually happened) and have it stick, whereas in Europe when Columbus was trying to finance a sea expedition, he could move from government to government when each successive one turned him down until he found some suckers to finance him.The problem is...this is a cultural explanation. It's saying that China didn't dominate the world because of cultural factors. And if that happened in China, why couldn't it have happened elsewhere. Did the Spanish beat the Aztecs who outnumbered them 100 to 1 because of their geography allowing them to develop superior technology, or was it because the Aztecs exacted ruinous tribute from their client states, causing their subjects to hate them and attach themselves to the first people who looked likely to overthrow their hated rulers? Did the Middle East fail to conquer the world because of increasing desertification and the movement of productive agriculture north and west, as Diamond states, or was it because the Mongols smashed through the states there, burned Baghdad to the ground, and destroyed the system of irrigation canals dating back to the Sumerians, causing a population collapse that Iraq did not recover from until the 20th century? Japan proved that it was perfectly capable of dominating all its neighbors after its modernization during the Meiji Restoration, so clearly it wasn't geography holding it back. Was it the Edo period's 
sakoku
 policy? Because that's another cultural explanation. Diamond spends the entire book talking about geographic and climactic factors being the main reason for the dominance of civilizations, and then chops his argument's legs off in the last 10 pages. The most obvious explanation is that it's a combination of these factors, but that's not what Guns, Germs, and Steel is about. The entire book is an argument for the primacy of geographical factors in determining why the Europeans came to be dominant over the last 500 years, but there are just too many holes and too few citations in the argument for it to be really effective. It's useful to add to the historiography of the European conquest and displacement of most of the rest of the world, but in no way should it be taken as a definitive text."
1523,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.Why is economic development so uneven around the world?Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. “Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?” “[W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents?” “[W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel?” In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a “unified synthesis”—a unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.Academic critics howledHowever, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel: They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. That’s nitpicking, as far as I’m concerned. And many of these “errors” could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories. Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamond’s book, it’s insulting to the reader. The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of “environmental determinism.” Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factors—but he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything we’ve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined. There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didn’t) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamond’s critics never read the book. However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, that’s no error. He didn’t pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.Is it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadn’t cited their own specialized research?The roots of academic criticismThough the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamond’s expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. It’s not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as “not serious.” And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.A wealth of meaning behind the titleTo understand where the academic critics went wrong, it’s useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. “The immediate reasons for Pizarro’s success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.”Diamond’s argument in a nutshellIn a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: “‘Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?'” To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. It’s unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the “civilization” in which we live.Diamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa—and the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United States—impeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the “guns, germs, and steel” that made Eurasian dominance possible—and dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.Guns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesn’t make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, you’ll find this book highly rewarding."
1524,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22548315-zachary-f,4,"In a cultural climate where avowed white supremacists regularly make headlines and elected officials can claim with a straight face that people of color have contributed nothing to world history, Guns, Germs and Steel remains as sadly relevant as it was when first published 20 years ago. Jared Diamond's thesis--that some people groups have historically triumphed over others not because they were made up of innately superior human beings, but rather because of the environmental factors that shaped their societies and fostered technological growth--is so simple and seemingly self-apparent that it’s hard to believe anyone ever had to write a book to prove it. And yet, as the examples above demonstrate, someone did--and a loud western minority (majority?) has still not gotten the message. This book won the Pulitzer and looms large in the pop history genre to this day, so I won’t spend too much time discussing its merits or breaking down its case point by point. Diamond argues persuasively and in great detail that, while humans themselves are pretty much the same everywhere, the environments in which our ancestors had to eke out their livings were not. Some parts of the globe (most notably the huge landmass comprising modern Europe, Asia, and North Africa) yielded an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species, along with the climate necessary to take advantage of these, while other regions did not lend themselves to farming in the same way. Agriculture led to food surpluses and sedentary living, which in turn led to denser populations, increased social and political stratification, and more time and resources for non-essential crafts and trades. With proximity to animals and large, concentrated groups of humans also came more diverse and complex diseases, and eventually immunity or resistance to these diseases. Finally, while the Eurasian landmass is oriented on an east-west axis, meaning that crops, animals, and ideas can spread thousands of miles in a short amount of time with no significant change in climate or environment type, the north-south axes of Africa and the Americas (complete with their own vast deserts and rainforests) make such sharing far more difficult. It’s not that so-called ""primitive"" societies are in any way worse than so-called ""advanced"" ones (Diamond claims that hunter-gatherers are actually better nourished on average than farmers, and they certainly seem no less happy), but they lack the biological, technological, and political advantages that large, sedentary societies possess. When a society armed with guns, horses, and deadly diseases comes against one without, the resulting conquest has nothing to do with the “genetic superiority” of the victors and everything to do with their material assets. Diamond is a biologist by trade, not a historian or an anthropologist, and he is at his best when describing the scientific principles behind the broad sweep of human history. He tends to falter when dealing with more specific details of history and culture, as when he claims that ""Like Arabs and Jews, Koreans and Japanese are peoples joined by blood, yet locked in traditional enmity"" (449). (The notion that Jews and Muslims are natural enemies is a popular one in this day and age, but totally unsupported by history; I suspect the relationship between Korea and Japan is more nuanced than he gives it credit for being, too.) Diamond's style can be dry and a bit repetitive, and he gives New Guinea (his adoptive homeland) what seems like a disproportionate amount of attention. There is also a subtle but unpleasant tinge of social Darwinism in his treatment of imperialism: he never attempts to explain why technologically-advanced peoples always seem to prey on their weaker neighbors, only how they do so--the implication being that such conflicts are inevitable whenever there is a power imbalance and that physical prowess is, in itself, justification for conquest. I don't think Diamond is intentionally advocating for the survival of the fittest (that would be at odds with the whole central thrust of his argument), but in a book whose express purpose is to explain why some peoples have come to dominate others, it seems like a pretty major oversight to neglect the motives of the people in question.Nevertheless, Diamond deserves credit for such a comprehensive and lucid treatment of an enormous and multifaceted topic. His arguments are rigorous, he treats his subjects with an even hand and fitting respect, and it's clear that his goal is to empower the oppressed rather than to glorify their oppressors. Recommended to anyone interested in why the world is how it is and unsatisfied with the reductive, self-serving rhetoric of our time and place."
1525,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232965-zain-hashmy,4,"Guns, Germs and Steel deserves two reviews, because writing one cannot do it justice. The first part of my review will be objective, and will concern general readers. The second part of my review will be personal and will deal with how I felt while reading this book. I'm writing this review now, with the details fresh in my mind, having finished the book only moments ago.Guns, Germs and Steel attempts to answer a complex geopolitical question ; Why have the Europeans emerged as the dominant power in the world, while many other native populations died out? Classically, the answer to this question is racist. In this book, Jared Diamond has explained through careful examination and observation why that racist answer should be consigned to oblivion. The question is addressed over 19 chapters, each of them covering as much ground as possible, to give a broad perspective and scope, with scientific studies and research to back up every claim. The argument stands tall on the basis of good science, spruced-up logic and well grounded theories. The average reader will delight in the simplicity of the book, and how the concepts are explained in great detail without excessive jargon. Jared goes over the rise and fall of civilizations, the modern day players, the development of technologies, and every anthropological factor that might possibly hold a clue. He treats this question as a giant puzzle, and gently assembles the pieces together to make the outline of a picture. Moreover, he himself admits that this is merely the outline of the picture, and the gaps need to be filled in by other writers, and more knowledge. That makes the book endearing, because the author understands the scope of the project, and acknowledges his own limitations. The writing style is somewhat verbose, and would benefit from some hack-n-slash editing, but overall, it remains an excellent book for most readers. Part 2.Unfortunately, I'm not one of those readers. Time to rant a bit. WHYY is the book so slow? I understand that he's trying to not be racist, but treading on eggshells all the way through the book, giving multiple explanations and scenarios to justify the same theory becomes taxing. Frustratingly enough, I understand the need to do that. It took one book, Madison's 'Passing of the Races', to inspire a man like Hitler into committing genocide, so this is probably a topic to tread carefully around. That doesn't make the argument style ANY less annoying. The explanations are drawn out and EVERY single detail is highlighted. With a background in Biotechnology and a strong interest in related sciences, I find his overexplanation of the subject terribly draining in many places. Furthermore, there are a few flaws in the argument, which I will discuss once a few other people have finished reading the book, and I've had a solid discussion with them. In simple terms, a normal scientific book will usually explain a concept at the start of the book, and for the rest of the book, will assume that you know the concept, so as to not double back on explanations. Not Mr. Diamond, noooo. I agree that this book should be made mandatory for anyone with a racist temperament, and their intelligence likely requires the repeated explanations but most people don't. I would happily recommend this book to an average person, but I would think ten times before recommending it to any of my friends because they are likely to get bored and abandon it halfway.More discussion on the flaws in theory is yet to come."
1526,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,3,"Why did Europe succeed?27 December 2012	This is one of those books that tries to ask the question of why the European civilisation managed to succeed where all other world civilisations failed. His conclusions are interesting, however we must remember that even now, fifteen years after this book was completed we are seeing an economic collapse in the west against an economic resurgence in China, India, and Brazil.	One of the ideas that he had was due to the axis of the continents. The only continent on a horizontal axis is the Eurasian mega-continent, which means that the entire continent is located in the temperate zone. However I find that idea to be a little dubious. Okay, granted, major civilisations arose across the continent: Europe, Arabia, India, and China; and trade existed among these four civilisations, however it does not really account for the rise of Europe to the exclusion of the rest.	One interesting idea I would suggest is to do with the Mongol hordes that smashed across Asia and the Middle East. In a way the Middle East never recovered from those invasions, and China was knocked back hundreds of years. Europe, by pure chance, managed to be spared, which meant that they were able to continue to develop ahead of the other Eurasian powers. This also resulted in them developing shipping which enabled them to take control of the Arabian Sea from the Arabs (since the land routes had been subsequently blocked by the Mongols).	The idea of trade along a horizontal axis is interesting, and we note that there was not much trade between the civilisations of America. Even then simple trade is unlikely to be hindered by tropical conditions. One thing about the American tribes is that they never developed shipping, which would have been something that prevented them from trading over long distances. In Africa we don't see much in the way of trade either, and the closer you get to the equator, the less developed the nations you encounter.	The concept of germs is interesting in that disease is a barrier to development. With malaria in the tropics it makes development of civilisation there difficult at best, and this can also prove a hindrance to trade, and Malaria is a disease that does not thrive well in colder climates. We also note that the common cold wrecked havoc in the Americas, where as the only disease we inherited from the New World was chlamydia, which is a sexually transmitted disease (the common cold is airbourne). However, that does not mean that Europe had been spared its devastating diseases, as the black plague ran rampant for over five hundred years and accounted for the death of up to a third of the population at its height.	Guns and steel deal more with technological development. The Eurasian civilisations had steel and guns were imported from China, but some suggest that the Chinese never used gunpower for weapons. That is rubbish. The Chinese had developed and were using explosives and rockets in warfare, but that did not save them from the Mongol Hordes. Even then, guns were a pretty poor weapon up until the eighteenth century, and were still quite inadequate. It wasn't until the 20th century that their truly devastating power comes into play.	The the balkanised nature of the European states also has a part to play. There is a point in that because there are all these competing countries all trying to gain an advantage over the other, which results in a perpetual arms race. That did not happen in China because the Chinese government pretty much controlled the entire region. However, that does not account for the fact that such balkanisation existed in the Americas and Africa. This also existed to an extent in the Middle East and India, but both of these regions, for a long time, have been under the dominant power of a single empire (the Ottomans in the Middle East and the Mogols, and later the British, in India). 	To me, the only real answer to this is that not only was Europe spared the ravaging of the Mongol hordes, but that we Europeans are in reality a sadistic and savage lot who are always looking for faster and more sophisticated ways of killing each other. It is not that the Native Americans lived in peace, they didn't, it was just that they were satisfied with using basic weapons. Even when they did have access to guns, they took them and then turned them on each other."
1527,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"The title “Guns, Germs and Steel” invokes in one’s mind the image of clacking metals and blazing guns. Then you suddenly realize you forgot about the germs part because you had no idea how to work gooey pathogens into such an awesome visual. In retrospect, however, you feel like Germs should have been the focal point of this title. Upon further musings, you reject that notion too and want to settle for something more mundane like “A brief history of post-Pleistocene humanity”. Maybe a more riveting title would have driven sales in the upward direction, but the central question that this book sets out to answer is no cakewalk: “Why did history take such divergent trajectories in the different continents?” Why indeed?Different variants of the same question have been posed for quite some time: “Why did Africa fail to launch a single civilization in the past 10,000 years or so?” “Of all the landmasses in the world, why did Eurasia enjoy a such massive headstart in creating giant empires, like the Roman empire in Italy or the Shang Dynasty in China?” “Why did Australian aborigines fail to move beyond the stone age on a timescale of thousands of years whereas the Europeans succeeded in creating and sustaining a modern nation state within two centuries of landing on the western coast of the continent?”Many answers have been proposed and depending on your worldview, you may prefer one over several others. In the pre-Renaissance era, the view of most people pondering over such matters can be summarized in a simple sentence: “They are filthy savages, we are civilized humans. That’s it” With the advent of biological evolution, efforts were made to recast the answer in more scientific terms: “Just as the Cro-Magnons were an evolutionary upgrade on the Neanderthals, so are we (Europeans/ Caucasians) a more advanced form of humans vis-à-vis the blacks/aborigines/Indians.” In retrospect, it might sound hilarious, but at that time, serious research works were carried out to show that Africans have a more primitive skull structure akin to the Chimpanzees. And then came Mendel with genetics and it did not take much time for people to weaponize that concept either. The Nazis believed they were a genetically superior race and actively carried out eugenics to optimize favorable hereditary characteristics among their people, despite zero science to back up such a genocidal social policy. To this day, the genetic superiority theory has no shortage of preachers and evangelists. The likes of Sam Harris and Jordan Petersen are going around the globe and brandishing psychologist Charles Murray’s Race-and-Intelligence Bell Curve. The implication is pretty straightforward, “Look mate, even if slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the likes did not happen, the African Americans would still be hard-pressed to climb up the social ladder since they are genetically indisposed to do so. Sad!!” The appropriation of scientific concepts by intellectuals of the social science disciplines to justify confounding claims is nothing new. And as I have already stated, each individual would be amenable to a different answer to this question depending on how he/she perceives the world-at-large. So, in the marketplace of ideas, who should we subscribe to? In other words, which discipline or branch of science is best-suited to answer this question? And the answer is: Anthropology. Wild as it may seem at first, you would think the responsibility to answer a question regarding humans should befell the people whose job is to literally study humans.And this is where this book shines brightly. Jared Diamond does a fantastic job of breaking down the geographical, agricultural, political and social forces that propelled different people to very disparate directions. But most importantly, this book stands as a solid buttress to human capital. Given the right tools and right conditions of existence, anyone possesses the mental faculty to do anything they would want to do. No one is genetically incapacitated to be an engineer or a physicist. But if you choose to believe otherwise, that is your prerogative. Just read the book and see if it can challenge, if not alter radically, your worldview. "
1528,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145461-rindis,3,"To a certain extent, I've always wondered why Guns, Germs, and Steel caused such a huge splash. The main premise boils down to 'differences in geography cause differences in societies and their history', which belongs to the club of the blindingly obvious.Of course, the real point of the book is to pin down just which differences are the important ones. This is a cause for much arguement, but Diamond has successfully pulled out the most important ones as applied to history as a whole. This largely turns into a study of what plants and animals were successfully domesticated in early prehistory, and how that turned certain areas into the origin of settled agriculture. That is still fairly basic stuff, but benefits greatly from studying the results from all around the world all at once, and examining just what it takes for something to be capable of being domesticated. (I know there's been some interesting work done on that since this book came out, but I haven't seen it escape scholarly journals in more detail than a National Geographic article.)From there, Diamond points out how plants and animals are generally adapted to a certain climate, and that while it is fairly easy to find different climates going east and west (due to cold mountains, dry deserts, wet coasts, and other accidents of geology), large differences of climate are guaranteed when traveling any real distance north and south. Looking at a map and noting that the Americas and Africa are divided into north-south zones, while Eurasia is oriented east-west, then provides material to show why certain areas needed to work everything out independently, while others were able to borrow everything they needed from elsewhere (before the Age of Exploration, the two situations were probably somewhat even by landmass; the book naturally spends much more time looking at the former).The main thing that makes this book new is actually the 'germs' part of the book. It is only fairly recently that we've really become aware of where most of the deadly diseases we have to deal with come from—other animals. So societies that have and live closely with lots of domesticatible animals get to suffer from deadly epidemics when an occasional virus adapts to a new host (us), and then develop some level of immunity to it. When people who don't have much/anything in the way of domesticated animals run into people who do, they die off as multiple epidemics run through the countryside. This is the other 'new' part—the fact that a lot of Native American population was wiped out by disease is well known, but it's been hard to realize the scale of the disaster. The ""Mound Builders"" were a disappeared pre-Columbian civilization of the Mississippi valley, and only recently has it been realized it was actually wiped out by European diseases before any Europeans got there to see it.The 'guns' and 'steel' parts of the book are essentially non-existent. They just serve as part of the proximate cause of how Europeans came to dominate the world before turning to look for the ultimate causes back in prehistory. This is where his biases as a biologist who's picked up a fair amount of practical cultural anthropology show. While he does discuss technology, and the fact that the wider the range of where you can get ideas from, the more ideas you will be able to encounter, he doesn't spend any time looking at the basics of physical technology. A basic study of easily available copper, tin, iron, and clay deposits, compared with the areas that were able to develop settled agriculture could explain much that remains mysterious to him.It's decidedly a layman's book, and has the advantage of being aware of more current research than any pre-college textbook. The fairly breezy, non-technical writing is set off by a good number of informative charts and maps and allow him to make his points without miring himself in the minutia that would lose the non-dedicated reader. Just being able to tackle most of pre-history in a single reasonably-sized volume is an impressive feat of summarization, and the most impressive thing about the book."
1529,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,4,"I'll let David Graeber speak of this book in a small blurb he wrote about Abdullah Öcalan's ""Manifesto For a Democratic Civilization I: The Age of Masked Gods and Disguised Kings"":""Considering the circumstances under which the book was written, I'd say the achievement here is quite impressive. Abdullah Ocalan seems to have done a better job writing with the extremely limited resources allowed him by his jailers than authors like Francis Fukuyama or Jared Diamond did with access to the world's finest research libraries."" — David GraeberThe conditions of which David Graeber speaks are that of being locked up in solitary confinement with 24 hour/day artificial light illuminating his cell. Allowed to have one book at a time, and oftimes no writing instruments. And the book(s) he wrote were communicated to the public via live speach, or in first draft form written hastily as part of his testimony for his trials.So, is Jared Diamond's book that bad that a guy who's locked up in such brutal conditions can do better? Well, not really. It is almost certain that Jared Diamond reveals important factors that went into the emergence and differentiation of variagrated civilization, it's just that his analysis is definitely incomplete by simple virtue of being more materialistic than that of any hardline marxist. There is very few, and ultimately unconvincing, arguments about the formation of institutions, the emergence of cities, and ultimately of nation-states. And almost no mention of any social movement of any kind.True to the title, the red thread woven through the entire analysis of civilization is done by looking at why certain societies had developed guns, germs, and steel the way they have. It presents rather novel ideas for the layperson not versed in the subject. A quick, and woefully incomplete, enumeration being:1) Euroasia had a geographical advantage because it had more indigenous crops that could potentially be domesticated2) The domestication of said plants could spread from the Fertile Crescent where they first emerged more easily because of relatively uniform climate along the longer axis (east-west) of Eurasia. The Americas suffering from the fact that their longest geographical distance was from north-south, thus cross-cutting through extremely different climates3) Eurasia also had more potential animals for domestication (also goes into why some species are better suited than others), thus Eurasians had a very decisive advantage in terms of the diseases that they developed resistance too, since most ones are of animal origin And so on. You get the picture, right? Fairly solid arguments, and worth carefully studying because they can almost immediately shut up racists, euro-centrists, and so on. But do not think that by reading this book you have garnered enough information about early human history to call it quits. It might be enough to show off at certain parties, but in order to actually synthesise new ways forward there's a long list of problems, not even touched upon, by Jared Diamond."
1530,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054464-john,1,"This was an utter bore. In all honesty, the points of this book could be better learned by playing Sid Meier's Civilization series.Mr. Diamond starts with a question (framed by a question from a New Guinean friend as to why white people are materially richer) and comes up with an answer that can be explained in a page or two. Yet, Mr. Diamond devotes over 400 pages to discussing stuff. The book is extremely repetitive, as he keeps reminding the reader of his conclusions in previous chapters, and runs through crop histories for pages on end. Reading the last chapter is enough to obtain an understanding of Guns, Germs, and Steel.Basically, the world is divided into Eurasia on one end, and the Americas, Africa, and Oceana at the other end. Because Eurasia is so big from east to west without insurmountable barriers, it had more mammals and crops capable of domestication, and had a better way of diffusing crop and animal domestication (and, in turn, technology) to other societies in relative climates. By contrast, the rest of the world didn't, since their north-south narrowness creates too many diverse climates for diffusing crops, or they faced too many geographic barriers. This takes 400 pages of explaining, somehow. Without crops and animals, societies in the other parts of the world didn't have huge population jumps, resistance to diseases from animals, or advanced technology. The end.Mr. Diamond admits that he doesn't explain why only Western Eurasia came to dominate the world instead of the other societies in Eurasia, then he proceeds to an explanation for a few pages (that would've been a more interesting topic). To sum up his final theory, Europe was less integrated, but integrated enough to compete with one another technologically. China was too integrated, and Mesopotamia killed their trees and became a desert. Well, golly."

In case this question immediately makes you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatise, you aren't: as you will see, the answers to the question don't involve human racial differences at all. The book's emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back the chain of historical causation as far as possible.Science writing just doesn't get any better than this. Everyone should read this book. It explains why some societies advanced more rapidly than others and the differences between the victors and the vanquished. I don't know if Professor Diamond came up with all of these brilliant observations, but he gets credit for writing the best book about them. I have given this book to at least a half dozen of my friends and relatives. You're welcome.After reading a couple of one and two star reviews I’ve noticed that they all seem to point towards some sort of racism in this book. These days unless you aren’t calling someone else a racist then obviously you are a racist. Is that about it? A lot of people said the book was boring or poorly written. I didn’t find that to be true, quite the opposite. I’ve read it twice. The ideas put forth in this book were novel to me and make complete sense. If there is a better way to explain the course of history it’s still waiting for me to find it. The critics never post another work we all should be reading. I learned an awful lot about plant and animal domestication and his theory of how geography played such an important part in human development was brilliant. "
1532,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/715626-joe,4,"As another reviewer has pointed out, the only thing the matter with this book is the title. It should really be called Germs, Agriculture, and Geographical Positioning. I can see why they went with the later but there is precious little discussion of guns or steel anywhere in the book.That being said, a very interesting read. Here is the essential thesis:“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.""This book is a great answer to the racist notions that european culture ""won"" over other cultures because they were superior, either physically or intellectually. The simple fact is that the different climates led to different germs, crops, and domesticated animals. All of these factors led to how easy a society became ""civilized."" It's as simple as that but a lot of the things Diamond brought up had never occurred to me.This book explains why we don't:- Have Hunting Cheetahs- Eat Lion Burgers- Grow acorns and eat them- Why the new world died from european diseases and not the other way aroundInteresting stuff but not quite the breathtaking game changer it had been built up to be."

This book provides a good antidote for racist or supremacist theories about the differences in development of different societies and a solid base for refutation of heroic narratives that distort history.Germs, for instance, were one of the major weapons that conquerers had, when they collided with native peoples. In some cases, 90% and more of the invaded were killed by a disease brought by the invading army.Jared Diamond writes about the differences the continents had that made plant and animal domestication initiate and develop at very different speeds. And goes on to show the effect that had on the cultures that arose after food production and domestic animals allowed for bigger populations, and more complex societies."

In many ways, what we end up with is an ambitious ""theory"" of world history derived from first-principles.Fair warning, the book is heavy on details about the histories of specific crops and so on which gets a bit dull for the casual reader, but if the premise is at all interesting to you, you will come out the other end feeling a lot less mystified about the large-scale course of world history.PS: See CGP Grey's ""Americapox: The Missing Plague"" video at https://youtu.be/JEYh5WACqEk for a really good summary of the ""germs"" part of this book."

Spanning the period since the beginnings of animal domestication and settled agriculture, it attempts to answer the question as to why particular regions of the globe developed when they did, socio-economically speaking, and why others never developed societies more advanced than hunter-gatherers. Diamond, a professional scientist and amateur historian, adduces a plausible argument based on environmental givens, an hypothesis with a great carrying capacity.This environmentally-deterministic study is counterbalanced by his later work, Collapse, which treats of the matter of the success and failure of human societies. Here social practices, human behaviors, are determinative, but once again in terms of environmental givens.The subtext to both volumes, what I read into them throughout, was an argument against genetic determinism--in other words, against racism.

The answer seems to come down to the ability to produce food through agriculture, which in turn allows for greater population density and faster innovation. Diamond acknowledges the influences of elements like politics, culture, and the Great Man theory, but notes how much less impact these had than environmental factors. Admittedly I lost steam on this one because of the repetition of tracing environmental factors through several regions of the world, but the cases presented were interesting and convincing."

Forget Isaac Newton, Mozart, Da Vinci and others. They belonged to societies that perpetrated war. This in a nutshell is the premise of this much lauded book. Really? Seriously? What about wars for independence, freedom from tyrants, or even communism? Was World War II frivolous and unnecessary? I doubt the aboriginals would think so under Hitler's regime.

Hence the focus is very narrow and the author remarks about the unanswered questions in the epilogue. The author builds a very convincing case of how Eurasia became quite different from say, the Americas or Africa in terms of technology and immunity to major diseases in 1500 which enabled them to conquer most parts of the world.

For example, it says if you think that Africans, Native Americans, and Asians/Australo-asians were inferior when Europeans arrived, think again. It was the environment (namely the lack of 'guns, germs and steel´ and why they didn't have those things) that determined their 'development'. Educational to say the least.

If you don't have gunpowder, you'll get steamrolled by any civilization who does unless you trade for it--and if you do that, you're at the mercy of the civilization that's providing it for you, and G-d help you if they declare war on you, because you'll lose your ability to make gunpowder units and get stomped.Second, trade. Civilizations that trade technological innovations often advance much faster than a single civilization that tries to turtle up and go Galt (which is my usual strategy...), and it's not unusually to end up behind the tech curve and run into a cavalry vs. tanks situation when expanding out beyond your traditional borders.Third, terrain. Mountains blocking expansion and trade are bad. Starting in the jungle is bad. Lack of natural resources are bad. Small islands are bad. Deserts are bad. All of those make expansion much more difficult and limit your population, which reduces the rate of your technological progress, so you advance slower, have less to trade, and eventually your cavalry gets steamrolled by tanks.There are plenty of points Guns, Germs, and Steel makes that Civilization simply doesn't cover, though, lest you think that playing a video game will provide the same educational experience. For one, disease vectors--a.k.a., why didn't the Europeans get wiped out by super plagues from the Americas? The simple answer is animals. The Eurasian civilizations lived in very close proximity to animals for most of their existence and most of the really serious diseases that affected humans in the past--smallpox, black plague, flu, and so on--were originally animal diseases that made the jump. The cultures in the Americans simply did not have the same range of animals as the Eurasian cultures did, so they had little exposure to animal-borne diseases and hence little resistance to them, and therefore both died in droves and did not inflict a similar fate on Europeans. The popular image of North America as a pristine wilderness is wrong--it wasn't a wilderness, it was a post-apocalyptic wasteland.Though as an interesting note, Diamond points out that when syphillis first appeared, it was a horrific disease that literally caused people's flesh to rot off and killed in months. It mutated shortly after its initially appearance into the insanity-causing, long-term disease we know today, however, and so Europe never experienced The Years of Rice and Salt.(note that whether syphillis actually came from the Americas is still somewhat controversial)Similarly, Civilization doesn't have climate bands, but they were hugely important in world history. Eurasia is oriented east-west, with a similar latitude and climate the whole length, and a contiguous land route to travel along, so it was easy for animals and plants tamed in one place (mostly the Middle East) to spread all along that climactic band to each of those civilizations. In contrast, the Americas are oriented north-south, with desert or mountain barriers in places, and Australia and Oceania have large expanses of water making trade harder and populations smaller in addition to latitude differences. It was difficult to get crops from one place to another, and because it took longer, there was a lower population for a longer time, which reduced the potential for innovation due to a lower possible number of inventors, thus leading to a technological gap which, in combination with the smallpoxalypse, led to the cultural and physical near-extermination of the Native Americans.That part, at least, is familiar to players of Civilization. More food means more people, which means more science and production, which means faster advancement, and it all feeds into each other until you're the ones with tanks stomping everyone else.Okay, enough about Civilization. Anyway, that's Diamond's theory, but there are a few problems with Guns, Germs, and Steel.For one, it is incredibly dry and boring. I often had to force myself to keep reading, and I'd get a few more pages in before I got distracted by something new and interesting. At least twice, I almost fell asleep while I was reading it. There are other reviews mentioning that it took them up to six months to finally finish the entire book, so be warned.Second, there are no footnotes. For a book like this, I'd expect dozens of pages of footnotes meticulously documenting all his assumptions, but that never happens, and it's much to the book's detriment.Third, for a book about why Europeans dominated the world, it's mostly focused on the far past--as Diamond phrases it, on the question I quoted at the beginning of the review. The actual process of domination isn't covered at all except for a brief section about the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas.Finally, and most damningly, the section at the end where Diamond talks about China actually serves to lever open the cracks in his argument. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, China and the Middle East were far more advanced than Europe was, and they also lie in the same Eurasian climactic band that Diamond proposes gave the civilizations within a competitive advantage. So, why is it that neither of them conquered everyone? Diamond has two explanations for this. For China, he claims that China's more continuous government worked against it, because it was possible for the government to ban sea exploration (as actually happened) and have it stick, whereas in Europe when Columbus was trying to finance a sea expedition, he could move from government to government when each successive one turned him down until he found some suckers to finance him.The problem is...this is a cultural explanation. It's saying that China didn't dominate the world because of cultural factors. And if that happened in China, why couldn't it have happened elsewhere. Did the Spanish beat the Aztecs who outnumbered them 100 to 1 because of their geography allowing them to develop superior technology, or was it because the Aztecs exacted ruinous tribute from their client states, causing their subjects to hate them and attach themselves to the first people who looked likely to overthrow their hated rulers? Did the Middle East fail to conquer the world because of increasing desertification and the movement of productive agriculture north and west, as Diamond states, or was it because the Mongols smashed through the states there, burned Baghdad to the ground, and destroyed the system of irrigation canals dating back to the Sumerians, causing a population collapse that Iraq did not recover from until the 20th century? Japan proved that it was perfectly capable of dominating all its neighbors after its modernization during the Meiji Restoration, so clearly it wasn't geography holding it back. Was it the Edo period's 
sakoku
 policy? Because that's another cultural explanation. Diamond spends the entire book talking about geographic and climactic factors being the main reason for the dominance of civilizations, and then chops his argument's legs off in the last 10 pages. The most obvious explanation is that it's a combination of these factors, but that's not what Guns, Germs, and Steel is about. The entire book is an argument for the primacy of geographical factors in determining why the Europeans came to be dominant over the last 500 years, but there are just too many holes and too few citations in the argument for it to be really effective. It's useful to add to the historiography of the European conquest and displacement of most of the rest of the world, but in no way should it be taken as a definitive text."
1553,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.Why is economic development so uneven around the world?Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. “Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?” “[W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents?” “[W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel?” In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a “unified synthesis”—a unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.Academic critics howledHowever, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel: They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. That’s nitpicking, as far as I’m concerned. And many of these “errors” could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories. Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamond’s book, it’s insulting to the reader. The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of “environmental determinism.” Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factors—but he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything we’ve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined. There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didn’t) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamond’s critics never read the book. However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, that’s no error. He didn’t pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.Is it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadn’t cited their own specialized research?The roots of academic criticismThough the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamond’s expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. It’s not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as “not serious.” And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.A wealth of meaning behind the titleTo understand where the academic critics went wrong, it’s useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. “The immediate reasons for Pizarro’s success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.”Diamond’s argument in a nutshellIn a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: “‘Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?'” To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. It’s unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the “civilization” in which we live.Diamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa—and the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United States—impeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the “guns, germs, and steel” that made Eurasian dominance possible—and dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.Guns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesn’t make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, you’ll find this book highly rewarding."
1554,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22548315-zachary-f,4,"In a cultural climate where avowed white supremacists regularly make headlines and elected officials can claim with a straight face that people of color have contributed nothing to world history, Guns, Germs and Steel remains as sadly relevant as it was when first published 20 years ago. Jared Diamond's thesis--that some people groups have historically triumphed over others not because they were made up of innately superior human beings, but rather because of the environmental factors that shaped their societies and fostered technological growth--is so simple and seemingly self-apparent that it’s hard to believe anyone ever had to write a book to prove it. And yet, as the examples above demonstrate, someone did--and a loud western minority (majority?) has still not gotten the message. This book won the Pulitzer and looms large in the pop history genre to this day, so I won’t spend too much time discussing its merits or breaking down its case point by point. Diamond argues persuasively and in great detail that, while humans themselves are pretty much the same everywhere, the environments in which our ancestors had to eke out their livings were not. Some parts of the globe (most notably the huge landmass comprising modern Europe, Asia, and North Africa) yielded an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species, along with the climate necessary to take advantage of these, while other regions did not lend themselves to farming in the same way. Agriculture led to food surpluses and sedentary living, which in turn led to denser populations, increased social and political stratification, and more time and resources for non-essential crafts and trades. With proximity to animals and large, concentrated groups of humans also came more diverse and complex diseases, and eventually immunity or resistance to these diseases. Finally, while the Eurasian landmass is oriented on an east-west axis, meaning that crops, animals, and ideas can spread thousands of miles in a short amount of time with no significant change in climate or environment type, the north-south axes of Africa and the Americas (complete with their own vast deserts and rainforests) make such sharing far more difficult. It’s not that so-called ""primitive"" societies are in any way worse than so-called ""advanced"" ones (Diamond claims that hunter-gatherers are actually better nourished on average than farmers, and they certainly seem no less happy), but they lack the biological, technological, and political advantages that large, sedentary societies possess. When a society armed with guns, horses, and deadly diseases comes against one without, the resulting conquest has nothing to do with the “genetic superiority” of the victors and everything to do with their material assets. Diamond is a biologist by trade, not a historian or an anthropologist, and he is at his best when describing the scientific principles behind the broad sweep of human history. He tends to falter when dealing with more specific details of history and culture, as when he claims that ""Like Arabs and Jews, Koreans and Japanese are peoples joined by blood, yet locked in traditional enmity"" (449). (The notion that Jews and Muslims are natural enemies is a popular one in this day and age, but totally unsupported by history; I suspect the relationship between Korea and Japan is more nuanced than he gives it credit for being, too.) Diamond's style can be dry and a bit repetitive, and he gives New Guinea (his adoptive homeland) what seems like a disproportionate amount of attention. There is also a subtle but unpleasant tinge of social Darwinism in his treatment of imperialism: he never attempts to explain why technologically-advanced peoples always seem to prey on their weaker neighbors, only how they do so--the implication being that such conflicts are inevitable whenever there is a power imbalance and that physical prowess is, in itself, justification for conquest. I don't think Diamond is intentionally advocating for the survival of the fittest (that would be at odds with the whole central thrust of his argument), but in a book whose express purpose is to explain why some peoples have come to dominate others, it seems like a pretty major oversight to neglect the motives of the people in question.Nevertheless, Diamond deserves credit for such a comprehensive and lucid treatment of an enormous and multifaceted topic. His arguments are rigorous, he treats his subjects with an even hand and fitting respect, and it's clear that his goal is to empower the oppressed rather than to glorify their oppressors. Recommended to anyone interested in why the world is how it is and unsatisfied with the reductive, self-serving rhetoric of our time and place."
1555,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232965-zain-hashmy,4,"Guns, Germs and Steel deserves two reviews, because writing one cannot do it justice. The first part of my review will be objective, and will concern general readers. The second part of my review will be personal and will deal with how I felt while reading this book. I'm writing this review now, with the details fresh in my mind, having finished the book only moments ago.Guns, Germs and Steel attempts to answer a complex geopolitical question ; Why have the Europeans emerged as the dominant power in the world, while many other native populations died out? Classically, the answer to this question is racist. In this book, Jared Diamond has explained through careful examination and observation why that racist answer should be consigned to oblivion. The question is addressed over 19 chapters, each of them covering as much ground as possible, to give a broad perspective and scope, with scientific studies and research to back up every claim. The argument stands tall on the basis of good science, spruced-up logic and well grounded theories. The average reader will delight in the simplicity of the book, and how the concepts are explained in great detail without excessive jargon. Jared goes over the rise and fall of civilizations, the modern day players, the development of technologies, and every anthropological factor that might possibly hold a clue. He treats this question as a giant puzzle, and gently assembles the pieces together to make the outline of a picture. Moreover, he himself admits that this is merely the outline of the picture, and the gaps need to be filled in by other writers, and more knowledge. That makes the book endearing, because the author understands the scope of the project, and acknowledges his own limitations. The writing style is somewhat verbose, and would benefit from some hack-n-slash editing, but overall, it remains an excellent book for most readers. Part 2.Unfortunately, I'm not one of those readers. Time to rant a bit. WHYY is the book so slow? I understand that he's trying to not be racist, but treading on eggshells all the way through the book, giving multiple explanations and scenarios to justify the same theory becomes taxing. Frustratingly enough, I understand the need to do that. It took one book, Madison's 'Passing of the Races', to inspire a man like Hitler into committing genocide, so this is probably a topic to tread carefully around. That doesn't make the argument style ANY less annoying. The explanations are drawn out and EVERY single detail is highlighted. With a background in Biotechnology and a strong interest in related sciences, I find his overexplanation of the subject terribly draining in many places. Furthermore, there are a few flaws in the argument, which I will discuss once a few other people have finished reading the book, and I've had a solid discussion with them. In simple terms, a normal scientific book will usually explain a concept at the start of the book, and for the rest of the book, will assume that you know the concept, so as to not double back on explanations. Not Mr. Diamond, noooo. I agree that this book should be made mandatory for anyone with a racist temperament, and their intelligence likely requires the repeated explanations but most people don't. I would happily recommend this book to an average person, but I would think ten times before recommending it to any of my friends because they are likely to get bored and abandon it halfway.More discussion on the flaws in theory is yet to come."
1556,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,3,"Why did Europe succeed?27 December 2012	This is one of those books that tries to ask the question of why the European civilisation managed to succeed where all other world civilisations failed. His conclusions are interesting, however we must remember that even now, fifteen years after this book was completed we are seeing an economic collapse in the west against an economic resurgence in China, India, and Brazil.	One of the ideas that he had was due to the axis of the continents. The only continent on a horizontal axis is the Eurasian mega-continent, which means that the entire continent is located in the temperate zone. However I find that idea to be a little dubious. Okay, granted, major civilisations arose across the continent: Europe, Arabia, India, and China; and trade existed among these four civilisations, however it does not really account for the rise of Europe to the exclusion of the rest.	One interesting idea I would suggest is to do with the Mongol hordes that smashed across Asia and the Middle East. In a way the Middle East never recovered from those invasions, and China was knocked back hundreds of years. Europe, by pure chance, managed to be spared, which meant that they were able to continue to develop ahead of the other Eurasian powers. This also resulted in them developing shipping which enabled them to take control of the Arabian Sea from the Arabs (since the land routes had been subsequently blocked by the Mongols).	The idea of trade along a horizontal axis is interesting, and we note that there was not much trade between the civilisations of America. Even then simple trade is unlikely to be hindered by tropical conditions. One thing about the American tribes is that they never developed shipping, which would have been something that prevented them from trading over long distances. In Africa we don't see much in the way of trade either, and the closer you get to the equator, the less developed the nations you encounter.	The concept of germs is interesting in that disease is a barrier to development. With malaria in the tropics it makes development of civilisation there difficult at best, and this can also prove a hindrance to trade, and Malaria is a disease that does not thrive well in colder climates. We also note that the common cold wrecked havoc in the Americas, where as the only disease we inherited from the New World was chlamydia, which is a sexually transmitted disease (the common cold is airbourne). However, that does not mean that Europe had been spared its devastating diseases, as the black plague ran rampant for over five hundred years and accounted for the death of up to a third of the population at its height.	Guns and steel deal more with technological development. The Eurasian civilisations had steel and guns were imported from China, but some suggest that the Chinese never used gunpower for weapons. That is rubbish. The Chinese had developed and were using explosives and rockets in warfare, but that did not save them from the Mongol Hordes. Even then, guns were a pretty poor weapon up until the eighteenth century, and were still quite inadequate. It wasn't until the 20th century that their truly devastating power comes into play.	The the balkanised nature of the European states also has a part to play. There is a point in that because there are all these competing countries all trying to gain an advantage over the other, which results in a perpetual arms race. That did not happen in China because the Chinese government pretty much controlled the entire region. However, that does not account for the fact that such balkanisation existed in the Americas and Africa. This also existed to an extent in the Middle East and India, but both of these regions, for a long time, have been under the dominant power of a single empire (the Ottomans in the Middle East and the Mogols, and later the British, in India). 	To me, the only real answer to this is that not only was Europe spared the ravaging of the Mongol hordes, but that we Europeans are in reality a sadistic and savage lot who are always looking for faster and more sophisticated ways of killing each other. It is not that the Native Americans lived in peace, they didn't, it was just that they were satisfied with using basic weapons. Even when they did have access to guns, they took them and then turned them on each other."
1557,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"The title “Guns, Germs and Steel” invokes in one’s mind the image of clacking metals and blazing guns. Then you suddenly realize you forgot about the germs part because you had no idea how to work gooey pathogens into such an awesome visual. In retrospect, however, you feel like Germs should have been the focal point of this title. Upon further musings, you reject that notion too and want to settle for something more mundane like “A brief history of post-Pleistocene humanity”. Maybe a more riveting title would have driven sales in the upward direction, but the central question that this book sets out to answer is no cakewalk: “Why did history take such divergent trajectories in the different continents?” Why indeed?Different variants of the same question have been posed for quite some time: “Why did Africa fail to launch a single civilization in the past 10,000 years or so?” “Of all the landmasses in the world, why did Eurasia enjoy a such massive headstart in creating giant empires, like the Roman empire in Italy or the Shang Dynasty in China?” “Why did Australian aborigines fail to move beyond the stone age on a timescale of thousands of years whereas the Europeans succeeded in creating and sustaining a modern nation state within two centuries of landing on the western coast of the continent?”Many answers have been proposed and depending on your worldview, you may prefer one over several others. In the pre-Renaissance era, the view of most people pondering over such matters can be summarized in a simple sentence: “They are filthy savages, we are civilized humans. That’s it” With the advent of biological evolution, efforts were made to recast the answer in more scientific terms: “Just as the Cro-Magnons were an evolutionary upgrade on the Neanderthals, so are we (Europeans/ Caucasians) a more advanced form of humans vis-à-vis the blacks/aborigines/Indians.” In retrospect, it might sound hilarious, but at that time, serious research works were carried out to show that Africans have a more primitive skull structure akin to the Chimpanzees. And then came Mendel with genetics and it did not take much time for people to weaponize that concept either. The Nazis believed they were a genetically superior race and actively carried out eugenics to optimize favorable hereditary characteristics among their people, despite zero science to back up such a genocidal social policy. To this day, the genetic superiority theory has no shortage of preachers and evangelists. The likes of Sam Harris and Jordan Petersen are going around the globe and brandishing psychologist Charles Murray’s Race-and-Intelligence Bell Curve. The implication is pretty straightforward, “Look mate, even if slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the likes did not happen, the African Americans would still be hard-pressed to climb up the social ladder since they are genetically indisposed to do so. Sad!!” The appropriation of scientific concepts by intellectuals of the social science disciplines to justify confounding claims is nothing new. And as I have already stated, each individual would be amenable to a different answer to this question depending on how he/she perceives the world-at-large. So, in the marketplace of ideas, who should we subscribe to? In other words, which discipline or branch of science is best-suited to answer this question? And the answer is: Anthropology. Wild as it may seem at first, you would think the responsibility to answer a question regarding humans should befell the people whose job is to literally study humans.And this is where this book shines brightly. Jared Diamond does a fantastic job of breaking down the geographical, agricultural, political and social forces that propelled different people to very disparate directions. But most importantly, this book stands as a solid buttress to human capital. Given the right tools and right conditions of existence, anyone possesses the mental faculty to do anything they would want to do. No one is genetically incapacitated to be an engineer or a physicist. But if you choose to believe otherwise, that is your prerogative. Just read the book and see if it can challenge, if not alter radically, your worldview. "
1558,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145461-rindis,3,"To a certain extent, I've always wondered why Guns, Germs, and Steel caused such a huge splash. The main premise boils down to 'differences in geography cause differences in societies and their history', which belongs to the club of the blindingly obvious.Of course, the real point of the book is to pin down just which differences are the important ones. This is a cause for much arguement, but Diamond has successfully pulled out the most important ones as applied to history as a whole. This largely turns into a study of what plants and animals were successfully domesticated in early prehistory, and how that turned certain areas into the origin of settled agriculture. That is still fairly basic stuff, but benefits greatly from studying the results from all around the world all at once, and examining just what it takes for something to be capable of being domesticated. (I know there's been some interesting work done on that since this book came out, but I haven't seen it escape scholarly journals in more detail than a National Geographic article.)From there, Diamond points out how plants and animals are generally adapted to a certain climate, and that while it is fairly easy to find different climates going east and west (due to cold mountains, dry deserts, wet coasts, and other accidents of geology), large differences of climate are guaranteed when traveling any real distance north and south. Looking at a map and noting that the Americas and Africa are divided into north-south zones, while Eurasia is oriented east-west, then provides material to show why certain areas needed to work everything out independently, while others were able to borrow everything they needed from elsewhere (before the Age of Exploration, the two situations were probably somewhat even by landmass; the book naturally spends much more time looking at the former).The main thing that makes this book new is actually the 'germs' part of the book. It is only fairly recently that we've really become aware of where most of the deadly diseases we have to deal with come from—other animals. So societies that have and live closely with lots of domesticatible animals get to suffer from deadly epidemics when an occasional virus adapts to a new host (us), and then develop some level of immunity to it. When people who don't have much/anything in the way of domesticated animals run into people who do, they die off as multiple epidemics run through the countryside. This is the other 'new' part—the fact that a lot of Native American population was wiped out by disease is well known, but it's been hard to realize the scale of the disaster. The ""Mound Builders"" were a disappeared pre-Columbian civilization of the Mississippi valley, and only recently has it been realized it was actually wiped out by European diseases before any Europeans got there to see it.The 'guns' and 'steel' parts of the book are essentially non-existent. They just serve as part of the proximate cause of how Europeans came to dominate the world before turning to look for the ultimate causes back in prehistory. This is where his biases as a biologist who's picked up a fair amount of practical cultural anthropology show. While he does discuss technology, and the fact that the wider the range of where you can get ideas from, the more ideas you will be able to encounter, he doesn't spend any time looking at the basics of physical technology. A basic study of easily available copper, tin, iron, and clay deposits, compared with the areas that were able to develop settled agriculture could explain much that remains mysterious to him.It's decidedly a layman's book, and has the advantage of being aware of more current research than any pre-college textbook. The fairly breezy, non-technical writing is set off by a good number of informative charts and maps and allow him to make his points without miring himself in the minutia that would lose the non-dedicated reader. Just being able to tackle most of pre-history in a single reasonably-sized volume is an impressive feat of summarization, and the most impressive thing about the book."

Abdullah Ocalan seems to have done a better job writing with the extremely limited resources allowed him by his jailers than authors like Francis Fukuyama or Jared Diamond did with access to the world's finest research libraries."" — David GraeberThe conditions of which David Graeber speaks are that of being locked up in solitary confinement with 24 hour/day artificial light illuminating his cell. Allowed to have one book at a time, and oftimes no writing instruments. And the book(s) he wrote were communicated to the public via live speach, or in first draft form written hastily as part of his testimony for his trials.So, is Jared Diamond's book that bad that a guy who's locked up in such brutal conditions can do better? Well, not really. It is almost certain that Jared Diamond reveals important factors that went into the emergence and differentiation of variagrated civilization, it's just that his analysis is definitely incomplete by simple virtue of being more materialistic than that of any hardline marxist. There is very few, and ultimately unconvincing, arguments about the formation of institutions, the emergence of cities, and ultimately of nation-states. And almost no mention of any social movement of any kind.True to the title, the red thread woven through the entire analysis of civilization is done by looking at why certain societies had developed guns, germs, and steel the way they have. It presents rather novel ideas for the layperson not versed in the subject. A quick, and woefully incomplete, enumeration being:1) Euroasia had a geographical advantage because it had more indigenous crops that could potentially be domesticated2) The domestication of said plants could spread from the Fertile Crescent where they first emerged more easily because of relatively uniform climate along the longer axis (east-west) of Eurasia. The Americas suffering from the fact that their longest geographical distance was from north-south, thus cross-cutting through extremely different climates3) Eurasia also had more potential animals for domestication (also goes into why some species are better suited than others), thus Eurasians had a very decisive advantage in terms of the diseases that they developed resistance too, since most ones are of animal origin And so on. You get the picture, right? Fairly solid arguments, and worth carefully studying because they can almost immediately shut up racists, euro-centrists, and so on. But do not think that by reading this book you have garnered enough information about early human history to call it quits. It might be enough to show off at certain parties, but in order to actually synthesise new ways forward there's a long list of problems, not even touched upon, by Jared Diamond."

In all honesty, the points of this book could be better learned by playing Sid Meier's Civilization series.Mr. Diamond starts with a question (framed by a question from a New Guinean friend as to why white people are materially richer) and comes up with an answer that can be explained in a page or two. Yet, Mr. Diamond devotes over 400 pages to discussing stuff. The book is extremely repetitive, as he keeps reminding the reader of his conclusions in previous chapters, and runs through crop histories for pages on end. Reading the last chapter is enough to obtain an understanding of Guns, Germs, and Steel.Basically, the world is divided into Eurasia on one end, and the Americas, Africa, and Oceana at the other end. Because Eurasia is so big from east to west without insurmountable barriers, it had more mammals and crops capable of domestication, and had a better way of diffusing crop and animal domestication (and, in turn, technology) to other societies in relative climates. By contrast, the rest of the world didn't, since their north-south narrowness creates too many diverse climates for diffusing crops, or they faced too many geographic barriers. This takes 400 pages of explaining, somehow. Without crops and animals, societies in the other parts of the world didn't have huge population jumps, resistance to diseases from animals, or advanced technology. The end.Mr. Diamond admits that he doesn't explain why only Western Eurasia came to dominate the world instead of the other societies in Eurasia, then he proceeds to an explanation for a few pages (that would've been a more interesting topic). To sum up his final theory, Europe was less integrated, but integrated enough to compete with one another technologically. China was too integrated, and Mesopotamia killed their trees and became a desert. Well, golly."

In case this question immediately makes you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatise, you aren't: as you will see, the answers to the question don't involve human racial differences at all. The book's emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back the chain of historical causation as far as possible.Science writing just doesn't get any better than this. Everyone should read this book. It explains why some societies advanced more rapidly than others and the differences between the victors and the vanquished. I don't know if Professor Diamond came up with all of these brilliant observations, but he gets credit for writing the best book about them. I have given this book to at least a half dozen of my friends and relatives. You're welcome.After reading a couple of one and two star reviews I’ve noticed that they all seem to point towards some sort of racism in this book. These days unless you aren’t calling someone else a racist then obviously you are a racist. Is that about it? A lot of people said the book was boring or poorly written. I didn’t find that to be true, quite the opposite. I’ve read it twice. The ideas put forth in this book were novel to me and make complete sense. If there is a better way to explain the course of history it’s still waiting for me to find it. The critics never post another work we all should be reading. I learned an awful lot about plant and animal domestication and his theory of how geography played such an important part in human development was brilliant. "

It should really be called Germs, Agriculture, and Geographical Positioning. I can see why they went with the later but there is precious little discussion of guns or steel anywhere in the book.That being said, a very interesting read. Here is the essential thesis:“History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.""This book is a great answer to the racist notions that european culture ""won"" over other cultures because they were superior, either physically or intellectually. The simple fact is that the different climates led to different germs, crops, and domesticated animals. All of these factors led to how easy a society became ""civilized."" It's as simple as that but a lot of the things Diamond brought up had never occurred to me.This book explains why we don't:- Have Hunting Cheetahs- Eat Lion Burgers- Grow acorns and eat them- Why the new world died from european diseases and not the other way aroundInteresting stuff but not quite the breathtaking game changer it had been built up to be."

This book provides a good antidote for racist or supremacist theories about the differences in development of different societies and a solid base for refutation of heroic narratives that distort history.Germs, for instance, were one of the major weapons that conquerers had, when they collided with native peoples. In some cases, 90% and more of the invaded were killed by a disease brought by the invading army.Jared Diamond writes about the differences the continents had that made plant and animal domestication initiate and develop at very different speeds. And goes on to show the effect that had on the cultures that arose after food production and domestic animals allowed for bigger populations, and more complex societies."

In many ways, what we end up with is an ambitious ""theory"" of world history derived from first-principles.Fair warning, the book is heavy on details about the histories of specific crops and so on which gets a bit dull for the casual reader, but if the premise is at all interesting to you, you will come out the other end feeling a lot less mystified about the large-scale course of world history.PS: See CGP Grey's ""Americapox: The Missing Plague"" video at https://youtu.be/JEYh5WACqEk for a really good summary of the ""germs"" part of this book."

Spanning the period since the beginnings of animal domestication and settled agriculture, it attempts to answer the question as to why particular regions of the globe developed when they did, socio-economically speaking, and why others never developed societies more advanced than hunter-gatherers. Diamond, a professional scientist and amateur historian, adduces a plausible argument based on environmental givens, an hypothesis with a great carrying capacity.This environmentally-deterministic study is counterbalanced by his later work, Collapse, which treats of the matter of the success and failure of human societies. Here social practices, human behaviors, are determinative, but once again in terms of environmental givens.The subtext to both volumes, what I read into them throughout, was an argument against genetic determinism--in other words, against racism.

The answer seems to come down to the ability to produce food through agriculture, which in turn allows for greater population density and faster innovation. Diamond acknowledges the influences of elements like politics, culture, and the Great Man theory, but notes how much less impact these had than environmental factors. Admittedly I lost steam on this one because of the repetition of tracing environmental factors through several regions of the world, but the cases presented were interesting and convincing."

The author builds a very convincing case of how Eurasia became quite different from say, the Americas or Africa in terms of technology and immunity to major diseases in 1500 which enabled them to conquer most parts of the world.

1582,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,3,"Guns, Germs, and Steel is basically an answer to the question, ""If Europeans aren't innately superior, why did they end up running everything for so long?"" Or, in the words of a New Guinean given in the beginning of the book:Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?For me, the best metaphor to frame the whole book in is in terms of a game of Civilization. And while I'm sure most anthropologists and ethnologists are even now launching themselves at the screen with their hands reaching for my neck, I'll lay out my case. Civilization IV has a lot of problems as an accurate model of human history and societal interaction (for example, technology as a tree), but it does demonstrate a lot of Diamond's points.For example, locally available resources. In Civilization IV, if you don't have any sulfur, you can't make gunpowder. If you don't have gunpowder, you'll get steamrolled by any civilization who does unless you trade for it--and if you do that, you're at the mercy of the civilization that's providing it for you, and G-d help you if they declare war on you, because you'll lose your ability to make gunpowder units and get stomped.Second, trade. Civilizations that trade technological innovations often advance much faster than a single civilization that tries to turtle up and go Galt (which is my usual strategy...), and it's not unusually to end up behind the tech curve and run into a cavalry vs. tanks situation when expanding out beyond your traditional borders.Third, terrain. Mountains blocking expansion and trade are bad. Starting in the jungle is bad. Lack of natural resources are bad. Small islands are bad. Deserts are bad. All of those make expansion much more difficult and limit your population, which reduces the rate of your technological progress, so you advance slower, have less to trade, and eventually your cavalry gets steamrolled by tanks.There are plenty of points Guns, Germs, and Steel makes that Civilization simply doesn't cover, though, lest you think that playing a video game will provide the same educational experience. For one, disease vectors--a.k.a., why didn't the Europeans get wiped out by super plagues from the Americas? The simple answer is animals. The Eurasian civilizations lived in very close proximity to animals for most of their existence and most of the really serious diseases that affected humans in the past--smallpox, black plague, flu, and so on--were originally animal diseases that made the jump. The cultures in the Americans simply did not have the same range of animals as the Eurasian cultures did, so they had little exposure to animal-borne diseases and hence little resistance to them, and therefore both died in droves and did not inflict a similar fate on Europeans. The popular image of North America as a pristine wilderness is wrong--it wasn't a wilderness, it was a post-apocalyptic wasteland.Though as an interesting note, Diamond points out that when syphillis first appeared, it was a horrific disease that literally caused people's flesh to rot off and killed in months. It mutated shortly after its initially appearance into the insanity-causing, long-term disease we know today, however, and so Europe never experienced The Years of Rice and Salt.(note that whether syphillis actually came from the Americas is still somewhat controversial)Similarly, Civilization doesn't have climate bands, but they were hugely important in world history. Eurasia is oriented east-west, with a similar latitude and climate the whole length, and a contiguous land route to travel along, so it was easy for animals and plants tamed in one place (mostly the Middle East) to spread all along that climactic band to each of those civilizations. In contrast, the Americas are oriented north-south, with desert or mountain barriers in places, and Australia and Oceania have large expanses of water making trade harder and populations smaller in addition to latitude differences. It was difficult to get crops from one place to another, and because it took longer, there was a lower population for a longer time, which reduced the potential for innovation due to a lower possible number of inventors, thus leading to a technological gap which, in combination with the smallpoxalypse, led to the cultural and physical near-extermination of the Native Americans.That part, at least, is familiar to players of Civilization. More food means more people, which means more science and production, which means faster advancement, and it all feeds into each other until you're the ones with tanks stomping everyone else.Okay, enough about Civilization. Anyway, that's Diamond's theory, but there are a few problems with Guns, Germs, and Steel.For one, it is incredibly dry and boring. I often had to force myself to keep reading, and I'd get a few more pages in before I got distracted by something new and interesting. At least twice, I almost fell asleep while I was reading it. There are other reviews mentioning that it took them up to six months to finally finish the entire book, so be warned.Second, there are no footnotes. For a book like this, I'd expect dozens of pages of footnotes meticulously documenting all his assumptions, but that never happens, and it's much to the book's detriment.Third, for a book about why Europeans dominated the world, it's mostly focused on the far past--as Diamond phrases it, on the question I quoted at the beginning of the review. The actual process of domination isn't covered at all except for a brief section about the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas.Finally, and most damningly, the section at the end where Diamond talks about China actually serves to lever open the cracks in his argument. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, China and the Middle East were far more advanced than Europe was, and they also lie in the same Eurasian climactic band that Diamond proposes gave the civilizations within a competitive advantage. So, why is it that neither of them conquered everyone? Diamond has two explanations for this. For China, he claims that China's more continuous government worked against it, because it was possible for the government to ban sea exploration (as actually happened) and have it stick, whereas in Europe when Columbus was trying to finance a sea expedition, he could move from government to government when each successive one turned him down until he found some suckers to finance him.The problem is...this is a cultural explanation. It's saying that China didn't dominate the world because of cultural factors. And if that happened in China, why couldn't it have happened elsewhere. Did the Spanish beat the Aztecs who outnumbered them 100 to 1 because of their geography allowing them to develop superior technology, or was it because the Aztecs exacted ruinous tribute from their client states, causing their subjects to hate them and attach themselves to the first people who looked likely to overthrow their hated rulers? Did the Middle East fail to conquer the world because of increasing desertification and the movement of productive agriculture north and west, as Diamond states, or was it because the Mongols smashed through the states there, burned Baghdad to the ground, and destroyed the system of irrigation canals dating back to the Sumerians, causing a population collapse that Iraq did not recover from until the 20th century? Japan proved that it was perfectly capable of dominating all its neighbors after its modernization during the Meiji Restoration, so clearly it wasn't geography holding it back. Was it the Edo period's 
sakoku
 policy? Because that's another cultural explanation. Diamond spends the entire book talking about geographic and climactic factors being the main reason for the dominance of civilizations, and then chops his argument's legs off in the last 10 pages. The most obvious explanation is that it's a combination of these factors, but that's not what Guns, Germs, and Steel is about. The entire book is an argument for the primacy of geographical factors in determining why the Europeans came to be dominant over the last 500 years, but there are just too many holes and too few citations in the argument for it to be really effective. It's useful to add to the historiography of the European conquest and displacement of most of the rest of the world, but in no way should it be taken as a definitive text."
1583,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.Why is economic development so uneven around the world?Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. “Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?” “[W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents?” “[W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel?” In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a “unified synthesis”—a unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.Academic critics howledHowever, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel: They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. That’s nitpicking, as far as I’m concerned. And many of these “errors” could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories. Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamond’s book, it’s insulting to the reader. The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of “environmental determinism.” Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factors—but he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything we’ve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined. There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didn’t) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamond’s critics never read the book. However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, that’s no error. He didn’t pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.Is it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadn’t cited their own specialized research?The roots of academic criticismThough the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamond’s expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. It’s not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as “not serious.” And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.A wealth of meaning behind the titleTo understand where the academic critics went wrong, it’s useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. “The immediate reasons for Pizarro’s success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.”Diamond’s argument in a nutshellIn a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: “‘Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?'” To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. It’s unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the “civilization” in which we live.Diamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa—and the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United States—impeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the “guns, germs, and steel” that made Eurasian dominance possible—and dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.Guns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesn’t make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, you’ll find this book highly rewarding."

Jared Diamond's thesis--that some people groups have historically triumphed over others not because they were made up of innately superior human beings, but rather because of the environmental factors that shaped their societies and fostered technological growth--is so simple and seemingly self-apparent that it’s hard to believe anyone ever had to write a book to prove it. And yet, as the examples above demonstrate, someone did--and a loud western minority (majority?) has still not gotten the message. This book won the Pulitzer and looms large in the pop history genre to this day, so I won’t spend too much time discussing its merits or breaking down its case point by point. Diamond argues persuasively and in great detail that, while humans themselves are pretty much the same everywhere, the environments in which our ancestors had to eke out their livings were not. Some parts of the globe (most notably the huge landmass comprising modern Europe, Asia, and North Africa) yielded an abundance of domesticable plant and animal species, along with the climate necessary to take advantage of these, while other regions did not lend themselves to farming in the same way. Agriculture led to food surpluses and sedentary living, which in turn led to denser populations, increased social and political stratification, and more time and resources for non-essential crafts and trades. With proximity to animals and large, concentrated groups of humans also came more diverse and complex diseases, and eventually immunity or resistance to these diseases. Finally, while the Eurasian landmass is oriented on an east-west axis, meaning that crops, animals, and ideas can spread thousands of miles in a short amount of time with no significant change in climate or environment type, the north-south axes of Africa and the Americas (complete with their own vast deserts and rainforests) make such sharing far more difficult. It’s not that so-called ""primitive"" societies are in any way worse than so-called ""advanced"" ones (Diamond claims that hunter-gatherers are actually better nourished on average than farmers, and they certainly seem no less happy), but they lack the biological, technological, and political advantages that large, sedentary societies possess. When a society armed with guns, horses, and deadly diseases comes against one without, the resulting conquest has nothing to do with the “genetic superiority” of the victors and everything to do with their material assets. Diamond is a biologist by trade, not a historian or an anthropologist, and he is at his best when describing the scientific principles behind the broad sweep of human history. He tends to falter when dealing with more specific details of history and culture, as when he claims that ""Like Arabs and Jews, Koreans and Japanese are peoples joined by blood, yet locked in traditional enmity"" (449). (The notion that Jews and Muslims are natural enemies is a popular one in this day and age, but totally unsupported by history; I suspect the relationship between Korea and Japan is more nuanced than he gives it credit for being, too.) Diamond's style can be dry and a bit repetitive, and he gives New Guinea (his adoptive homeland) what seems like a disproportionate amount of attention. There is also a subtle but unpleasant tinge of social Darwinism in his treatment of imperialism: he never attempts to explain why technologically-advanced peoples always seem to prey on their weaker neighbors, only how they do so--the implication being that such conflicts are inevitable whenever there is a power imbalance and that physical prowess is, in itself, justification for conquest. I don't think Diamond is intentionally advocating for the survival of the fittest (that would be at odds with the whole central thrust of his argument), but in a book whose express purpose is to explain why some peoples have come to dominate others, it seems like a pretty major oversight to neglect the motives of the people in question.Nevertheless, Diamond deserves credit for such a comprehensive and lucid treatment of an enormous and multifaceted topic. His arguments are rigorous, he treats his subjects with an even hand and fitting respect, and it's clear that his goal is to empower the oppressed rather than to glorify their oppressors. Recommended to anyone interested in why the world is how it is and unsatisfied with the reductive, self-serving rhetoric of our time and place."
1585,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232965-zain-hashmy,4,"Guns, Germs and Steel deserves two reviews, because writing one cannot do it justice. The first part of my review will be objective, and will concern general readers. The second part of my review will be personal and will deal with how I felt while reading this book. I'm writing this review now, with the details fresh in my mind, having finished the book only moments ago.Guns, Germs and Steel attempts to answer a complex geopolitical question ; Why have the Europeans emerged as the dominant power in the world, while many other native populations died out? Classically, the answer to this question is racist. In this book, Jared Diamond has explained through careful examination and observation why that racist answer should be consigned to oblivion. The question is addressed over 19 chapters, each of them covering as much ground as possible, to give a broad perspective and scope, with scientific studies and research to back up every claim. The argument stands tall on the basis of good science, spruced-up logic and well grounded theories. The average reader will delight in the simplicity of the book, and how the concepts are explained in great detail without excessive jargon. Jared goes over the rise and fall of civilizations, the modern day players, the development of technologies, and every anthropological factor that might possibly hold a clue. He treats this question as a giant puzzle, and gently assembles the pieces together to make the outline of a picture. Moreover, he himself admits that this is merely the outline of the picture, and the gaps need to be filled in by other writers, and more knowledge. That makes the book endearing, because the author understands the scope of the project, and acknowledges his own limitations. The writing style is somewhat verbose, and would benefit from some hack-n-slash editing, but overall, it remains an excellent book for most readers. Part 2.Unfortunately, I'm not one of those readers. Time to rant a bit. WHYY is the book so slow? I understand that he's trying to not be racist, but treading on eggshells all the way through the book, giving multiple explanations and scenarios to justify the same theory becomes taxing. Frustratingly enough, I understand the need to do that. It took one book, Madison's 'Passing of the Races', to inspire a man like Hitler into committing genocide, so this is probably a topic to tread carefully around. That doesn't make the argument style ANY less annoying. The explanations are drawn out and EVERY single detail is highlighted. With a background in Biotechnology and a strong interest in related sciences, I find his overexplanation of the subject terribly draining in many places. Furthermore, there are a few flaws in the argument, which I will discuss once a few other people have finished reading the book, and I've had a solid discussion with them. In simple terms, a normal scientific book will usually explain a concept at the start of the book, and for the rest of the book, will assume that you know the concept, so as to not double back on explanations. Not Mr. Diamond, noooo. I agree that this book should be made mandatory for anyone with a racist temperament, and their intelligence likely requires the repeated explanations but most people don't. I would happily recommend this book to an average person, but I would think ten times before recommending it to any of my friends because they are likely to get bored and abandon it halfway.More discussion on the flaws in theory is yet to come."
1586,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,3,"Why did Europe succeed?27 December 2012	This is one of those books that tries to ask the question of why the European civilisation managed to succeed where all other world civilisations failed. His conclusions are interesting, however we must remember that even now, fifteen years after this book was completed we are seeing an economic collapse in the west against an economic resurgence in China, India, and Brazil.	One of the ideas that he had was due to the axis of the continents. The only continent on a horizontal axis is the Eurasian mega-continent, which means that the entire continent is located in the temperate zone. However I find that idea to be a little dubious. Okay, granted, major civilisations arose across the continent: Europe, Arabia, India, and China; and trade existed among these four civilisations, however it does not really account for the rise of Europe to the exclusion of the rest.	One interesting idea I would suggest is to do with the Mongol hordes that smashed across Asia and the Middle East. In a way the Middle East never recovered from those invasions, and China was knocked back hundreds of years. Europe, by pure chance, managed to be spared, which meant that they were able to continue to develop ahead of the other Eurasian powers. This also resulted in them developing shipping which enabled them to take control of the Arabian Sea from the Arabs (since the land routes had been subsequently blocked by the Mongols).	The idea of trade along a horizontal axis is interesting, and we note that there was not much trade between the civilisations of America. Even then simple trade is unlikely to be hindered by tropical conditions. One thing about the American tribes is that they never developed shipping, which would have been something that prevented them from trading over long distances. In Africa we don't see much in the way of trade either, and the closer you get to the equator, the less developed the nations you encounter.	The concept of germs is interesting in that disease is a barrier to development. With malaria in the tropics it makes development of civilisation there difficult at best, and this can also prove a hindrance to trade, and Malaria is a disease that does not thrive well in colder climates. We also note that the common cold wrecked havoc in the Americas, where as the only disease we inherited from the New World was chlamydia, which is a sexually transmitted disease (the common cold is airbourne). However, that does not mean that Europe had been spared its devastating diseases, as the black plague ran rampant for over five hundred years and accounted for the death of up to a third of the population at its height.	Guns and steel deal more with technological development. The Eurasian civilisations had steel and guns were imported from China, but some suggest that the Chinese never used gunpower for weapons. That is rubbish. The Chinese had developed and were using explosives and rockets in warfare, but that did not save them from the Mongol Hordes. Even then, guns were a pretty poor weapon up until the eighteenth century, and were still quite inadequate. It wasn't until the 20th century that their truly devastating power comes into play.	The the balkanised nature of the European states also has a part to play. There is a point in that because there are all these competing countries all trying to gain an advantage over the other, which results in a perpetual arms race. That did not happen in China because the Chinese government pretty much controlled the entire region. However, that does not account for the fact that such balkanisation existed in the Americas and Africa. This also existed to an extent in the Middle East and India, but both of these regions, for a long time, have been under the dominant power of a single empire (the Ottomans in the Middle East and the Mogols, and later the British, in India). 	To me, the only real answer to this is that not only was Europe spared the ravaging of the Mongol hordes, but that we Europeans are in reality a sadistic and savage lot who are always looking for faster and more sophisticated ways of killing each other. It is not that the Native Americans lived in peace, they didn't, it was just that they were satisfied with using basic weapons. Even when they did have access to guns, they took them and then turned them on each other."
1587,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"The title “Guns, Germs and Steel” invokes in one’s mind the image of clacking metals and blazing guns. Then you suddenly realize you forgot about the germs part because you had no idea how to work gooey pathogens into such an awesome visual. In retrospect, however, you feel like Germs should have been the focal point of this title. Upon further musings, you reject that notion too and want to settle for something more mundane like “A brief history of post-Pleistocene humanity”. Maybe a more riveting title would have driven sales in the upward direction, but the central question that this book sets out to answer is no cakewalk: “Why did history take such divergent trajectories in the different continents?” Why indeed?Different variants of the same question have been posed for quite some time: “Why did Africa fail to launch a single civilization in the past 10,000 years or so?” “Of all the landmasses in the world, why did Eurasia enjoy a such massive headstart in creating giant empires, like the Roman empire in Italy or the Shang Dynasty in China?” “Why did Australian aborigines fail to move beyond the stone age on a timescale of thousands of years whereas the Europeans succeeded in creating and sustaining a modern nation state within two centuries of landing on the western coast of the continent?”Many answers have been proposed and depending on your worldview, you may prefer one over several others. In the pre-Renaissance era, the view of most people pondering over such matters can be summarized in a simple sentence: “They are filthy savages, we are civilized humans. That’s it” With the advent of biological evolution, efforts were made to recast the answer in more scientific terms: “Just as the Cro-Magnons were an evolutionary upgrade on the Neanderthals, so are we (Europeans/ Caucasians) a more advanced form of humans vis-à-vis the blacks/aborigines/Indians.” In retrospect, it might sound hilarious, but at that time, serious research works were carried out to show that Africans have a more primitive skull structure akin to the Chimpanzees. And then came Mendel with genetics and it did not take much time for people to weaponize that concept either. The Nazis believed they were a genetically superior race and actively carried out eugenics to optimize favorable hereditary characteristics among their people, despite zero science to back up such a genocidal social policy. To this day, the genetic superiority theory has no shortage of preachers and evangelists. The likes of Sam Harris and Jordan Petersen are going around the globe and brandishing psychologist Charles Murray’s Race-and-Intelligence Bell Curve. The implication is pretty straightforward, “Look mate, even if slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the likes did not happen, the African Americans would still be hard-pressed to climb up the social ladder since they are genetically indisposed to do so. Sad!!” The appropriation of scientific concepts by intellectuals of the social science disciplines to justify confounding claims is nothing new. And as I have already stated, each individual would be amenable to a different answer to this question depending on how he/she perceives the world-at-large. So, in the marketplace of ideas, who should we subscribe to? In other words, which discipline or branch of science is best-suited to answer this question? And the answer is: Anthropology. Wild as it may seem at first, you would think the responsibility to answer a question regarding humans should befell the people whose job is to literally study humans.And this is where this book shines brightly. Jared Diamond does a fantastic job of breaking down the geographical, agricultural, political and social forces that propelled different people to very disparate directions. But most importantly, this book stands as a solid buttress to human capital. Given the right tools and right conditions of existence, anyone possesses the mental faculty to do anything they would want to do. No one is genetically incapacitated to be an engineer or a physicist. But if you choose to believe otherwise, that is your prerogative. Just read the book and see if it can challenge, if not alter radically, your worldview. "
1588,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145461-rindis,3,"To a certain extent, I've always wondered why Guns, Germs, and Steel caused such a huge splash. The main premise boils down to 'differences in geography cause differences in societies and their history', which belongs to the club of the blindingly obvious.Of course, the real point of the book is to pin down just which differences are the important ones. This is a cause for much arguement, but Diamond has successfully pulled out the most important ones as applied to history as a whole. This largely turns into a study of what plants and animals were successfully domesticated in early prehistory, and how that turned certain areas into the origin of settled agriculture. That is still fairly basic stuff, but benefits greatly from studying the results from all around the world all at once, and examining just what it takes for something to be capable of being domesticated. (I know there's been some interesting work done on that since this book came out, but I haven't seen it escape scholarly journals in more detail than a National Geographic article.)From there, Diamond points out how plants and animals are generally adapted to a certain climate, and that while it is fairly easy to find different climates going east and west (due to cold mountains, dry deserts, wet coasts, and other accidents of geology), large differences of climate are guaranteed when traveling any real distance north and south. Looking at a map and noting that the Americas and Africa are divided into north-south zones, while Eurasia is oriented east-west, then provides material to show why certain areas needed to work everything out independently, while others were able to borrow everything they needed from elsewhere (before the Age of Exploration, the two situations were probably somewhat even by landmass; the book naturally spends much more time looking at the former).The main thing that makes this book new is actually the 'germs' part of the book. It is only fairly recently that we've really become aware of where most of the deadly diseases we have to deal with come from—other animals. So societies that have and live closely with lots of domesticatible animals get to suffer from deadly epidemics when an occasional virus adapts to a new host (us), and then develop some level of immunity to it. When people who don't have much/anything in the way of domesticated animals run into people who do, they die off as multiple epidemics run through the countryside. This is the other 'new' part—the fact that a lot of Native American population was wiped out by disease is well known, but it's been hard to realize the scale of the disaster. The ""Mound Builders"" were a disappeared pre-Columbian civilization of the Mississippi valley, and only recently has it been realized it was actually wiped out by European diseases before any Europeans got there to see it.The 'guns' and 'steel' parts of the book are essentially non-existent. They just serve as part of the proximate cause of how Europeans came to dominate the world before turning to look for the ultimate causes back in prehistory. This is where his biases as a biologist who's picked up a fair amount of practical cultural anthropology show. While he does discuss technology, and the fact that the wider the range of where you can get ideas from, the more ideas you will be able to encounter, he doesn't spend any time looking at the basics of physical technology. A basic study of easily available copper, tin, iron, and clay deposits, compared with the areas that were able to develop settled agriculture could explain much that remains mysterious to him.It's decidedly a layman's book, and has the advantage of being aware of more current research than any pre-college textbook. The fairly breezy, non-technical writing is set off by a good number of informative charts and maps and allow him to make his points without miring himself in the minutia that would lose the non-dedicated reader. Just being able to tackle most of pre-history in a single reasonably-sized volume is an impressive feat of summarization, and the most impressive thing about the book."
1589,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,4,"I'll let David Graeber speak of this book in a small blurb he wrote about Abdullah Öcalan's ""Manifesto For a Democratic Civilization I: The Age of Masked Gods and Disguised Kings"":""Considering the circumstances under which the book was written, I'd say the achievement here is quite impressive. Abdullah Ocalan seems to have done a better job writing with the extremely limited resources allowed him by his jailers than authors like Francis Fukuyama or Jared Diamond did with access to the world's finest research libraries."" — David GraeberThe conditions of which David Graeber speaks are that of being locked up in solitary confinement with 24 hour/day artificial light illuminating his cell. Allowed to have one book at a time, and oftimes no writing instruments. And the book(s) he wrote were communicated to the public via live speach, or in first draft form written hastily as part of his testimony for his trials.So, is Jared Diamond's book that bad that a guy who's locked up in such brutal conditions can do better? Well, not really. It is almost certain that Jared Diamond reveals important factors that went into the emergence and differentiation of variagrated civilization, it's just that his analysis is definitely incomplete by simple virtue of being more materialistic than that of any hardline marxist. There is very few, and ultimately unconvincing, arguments about the formation of institutions, the emergence of cities, and ultimately of nation-states. And almost no mention of any social movement of any kind.True to the title, the red thread woven through the entire analysis of civilization is done by looking at why certain societies had developed guns, germs, and steel the way they have. It presents rather novel ideas for the layperson not versed in the subject. A quick, and woefully incomplete, enumeration being:1) Euroasia had a geographical advantage because it had more indigenous crops that could potentially be domesticated2) The domestication of said plants could spread from the Fertile Crescent where they first emerged more easily because of relatively uniform climate along the longer axis (east-west) of Eurasia. The Americas suffering from the fact that their longest geographical distance was from north-south, thus cross-cutting through extremely different climates3) Eurasia also had more potential animals for domestication (also goes into why some species are better suited than others), thus Eurasians had a very decisive advantage in terms of the diseases that they developed resistance too, since most ones are of animal origin And so on. You get the picture, right? Fairly solid arguments, and worth carefully studying because they can almost immediately shut up racists, euro-centrists, and so on. But do not think that by reading this book you have garnered enough information about early human history to call it quits. It might be enough to show off at certain parties, but in order to actually synthesise new ways forward there's a long list of problems, not even touched upon, by Jared Diamond."
