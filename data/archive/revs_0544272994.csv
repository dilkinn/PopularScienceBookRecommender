0,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4217214-steve-alexander,5,This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. And I have read over 10 books.
1,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/922495-patrick,5,"I've been a reader of XKCD for ages. Not just a reader, a fan. A big goey, geeky fan. So much of a fan that when I heard about this book, I went so far as to abuse my power as an author to get an Advance Reading Copy of the book, so that I could enjoy its deliciousness sooner. And... y'know... taunt people on the internet. And it worked. I got an early copy. And I treasured it. I petted it. It was precious to me. Precious. Then life got in the way. Conventions. Promotion for my own book launch. I had dad stuff to do. I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser. Then I had my book tour.... Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did. "
2,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?"

  Trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.
Randall Munroe, ex-NASA employee and author of the wildly popular webcomic XKCD, decides to look at several, undoubtedly, absurd questions and find scientific answers to them.Nothing is too absurd for him - whether it be the logistics of finding your soulmate to what happens if our moon suddenly disappears - Munroe answers it all.
But I’ve never seen the Icarus story as a lesson about the limitations of humans. I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.
I absolutely loved the tone of voice throughout the book. 
There’s no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word “NO” scrawled over and over in charred blood.
His hilarious deadpan just absolutely cinched this book for me. 
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.
 
Who knew that physics could be so fun? 
Honestly, teachers need to stop the whole calculate-the-gravity-of-a-falling-ball shtick and jump on the calculate-the-force-of-wind-turbines-powered-by-people-at-a-gym bandwagon. Seriously, just make learning fun and the rest will go from there.In short - yes! Loved this one - it was so much fun!Audiobook CommentsI absolutely LOVED how you can just feel the enthusiasm coming from the reader. Even when he read out the math problems - you can tell that he was into it. Really made the book enjoyable!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads Happy Reading!"

Off the toilet too, but I learned so much and the writing is so engaging and entertaining and just MARVELOUS. Of course in the style of xkcd, this and Atlas Obscura would be my go-to book gifts this year. "

Several of them have bought their own copies, and they are, I believe, planning to use their math skills for good, and not for world domination."
6,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya,5,"“But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”Randall Munroe of xkcd.com fame (a former physicist and NASA robotics employee turned brilliant comics artist) can come to my house for tea and in-depth discussion of hypothetical scenarios based on the world’s dumbest questions (while showing me his back-of-the-napkin math which I will blindly believe as it will just whoosh over my head like a jet plane) any time. Dear Mr. Munroe, please consider this a standing invitation.When I was five, I was trying to figure out how difficult it would be to reach the Moon if I were to stack chairs on top of each other (for a head start, beginning this enterprise from the roof of a 9-story building). I was sure about a 1000 would do. I should have just contacted Randall Munroe.
 “DISCLAIMER: Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind.”
This book will provide you with detailed physics and mathematics solutions to a plethora of …ahem… interesting questions. I picked a few just to convey to you how deep the sheer awesomeness of ‘What If’ goes.——————————————————————
 “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?”
Munroe approaches this very important question with scientific rigor. After consulting literature on the steak drag coefficient, US military studies from the Cold War era, “research papers on the heating of ICBM nose cones as they reenter the atmosphere” and a cookbook (duh!), making an assumption that “Steaks can probably survive breaking the sound barrier”, and after making amazing graphs such as the one below …

 … he finally comes to the obvious conclusion that “we should drop the steak over Pittsburgh” (because of the tradition of “Pittsburgh rare” steaks there), and our elegant answer is:
 “So drop your steak from a suborbital rocket, send out a collection team to recover it, brush it off, reheat it, cut away any badly charred sections, and dig in.Just watch out for salmonella. And the Andromeda Strain.”
—————————————
 “How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?”
Some simple models clearly give you the only plausible answer: Netherlands will become a supraplanetary entity. To see how, you need to read for yourself.


“Supposing you did drain the oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?”
Again, the answer is clear — it’s a future that will be Netherlands-shaped:
—————————————
“What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?”
Brief answer: “NEARLY EVERYONE WOULD DIE. Then things would get interesting.”—————————————
 “What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?”
Answer: “Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.”
—————————————
 “How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?”

“Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90 percent of the speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.”———————————
 “How much Force power can Yoda output?”
“I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.”
After a fair share of assumptions and equations, it’s blatantly obvious that Yoda is a much better power source than Luke Skywalker. But a word of caution before we change our power grid to Yoda-based: “So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would definitely be green.”5 stars. If I’m ever shipwrecked on a remote island, I hope to have this book with me — maybe somewhere in its depths there’s a calculation of how long I can last before resorting to cannibalism."
7,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seen:""Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind. The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting, directly or indirectly, from information contained in this book.""That disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science: Dangerous ideas ahead, folks! Don't get too close -- these things could kill ya!Randall Munroe used to work at NASA, and now he creates the webcomic XKCD (which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig). On his website, he takes ""absurd hypothetical questions"" from readers and tries to answer some of them. Here are some of my favorite questions in this book:What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?Which US state is actually flown over the most?Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?How high can a human throw something?How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?When, if ever, will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?How many Lego bricks would it take to build a bridge capable of carrying traffic from London to New York? Have that many Lego bricks been manufactured?What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?If you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions, this book is for you! What made this so much fun, aside from the ridiculous questions, is Munroe's sense of humor. Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers, which is not something that usually happens when I'm reading about science. Oh, and be sure to read his footnotes, which have even more jokes.I think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works. I think I would have loved it when I was 10. *I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book, because I had never heard of the author before. It's the miracle of Goodreads! "
8,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"Mr Munroe includes some “weird and worrying” questions from his website’s inbox which he presents without attempting to answer – one favourite was:If you saved a whole life’s worth of kissing and used all that suction power on one single kiss, how much suction force would that single kiss have?I guess the answer might be “what pharmaceutical products have you ingested during the last four hours?” or “May I speak to your parents?”Another person named Jon Merrill askedHow fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Answer has to be “as fast as I will be running if I ever meet you Jon”.And a person called Kenneth askedWhat if every day, every human had a 1 per cent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a one percent chance of being turned into a human?  Randall does not provide a response to that one but I would have said Kenneth, if only life were like that. Wouldn’t it be fabulous?Everybody likes this book and I liked half of it, the other half was so far over my head it might have been a distant Andean condor croaking Sanskrit into a Bluetooth headset. Some of the stuff Randall devotes pages of detailed analysis to did not tickle my ivories, likeWhat would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put into an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? I mean, get a life. Who the flook cares about a hair dryer in a box? But many are very interesting. He tackles the old chestnutWhat would happen of everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same time?  He picks Rhode Island (it’s just big enough for everyone on Earth, surprisingly) as a designated place where this event might be staged, and imagines the result. In regard to the jump and the landing itself, not so much would result. But then he imagines the implications of all those people trying to get back home from Rhode Island. It’s terrible – it’s an apocalypse. If this mass jumping event was actually staged it would cause the immediate termination of civilisation and the death of billions. The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Yes it is a nice book but I do not recommend that you wolf down this book as I did in 2 days, because it’s like TOO MUCH and it can get annoying. You keep thinking of your own absurd questions – How many soldier ants would it take to chew through my leg in one hour? And would I survive? And really, there is one question which I really want to ask Randall, it’s actually been something I have been wondering about for a long time – you know those vending machines stuffed full of really unhealthy chocs and crisps and cokes? Well, imagine a person was chained to one of those and had an infinite amount of small change within arms reach. Then imagine the vending machine gets refilled by the usual contractor in the usual way (who never notices the chained person). So : how long would it take the captive to die from a constant diet of crap? If they were only eating chocs and crisps and drinking cokes? A month? Six months? A YEAR?? It’s really bugging me. I may have to launch a practical experiment. "
9,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,5,"One of the things that's nice about goodreads is that it lets you embed pictures. ...And one of the nice things about xkcd is that it has lots of pictures licensed under CC Attribution/Non-Commerical - meaning I can post as many as I want to this review.I'm pretty sure that if you're here, you already know about xkcd. But hey, why the heck not? Right? XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famous.The book comes from his ""what if"" blog, which is also very good.I took the book into work with me to show it around - you know - hipster-esque and what not. I'm reading this trendy, new book first.But the guys at my table were all like, ""Yeah... I can see myself reading like 2 or 3 of these and then putting the book down..."" Everyone more or less nodded in agreement - even though they thought the book was cool.Then I looked at the book a little bit more closely, flipped through a little bit and thought, ""Huh... that sounds about right. That's probably what I'm going to do...""I'll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions... This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly. You know: ""But what if Hitler hadn't killed the Jews? Would you like him then?"" or ""What if Martin Luther King Jr. had used violence? You have to admit, it's pretty crazy that we've given this guy a holiday, right?"" He has a point.So, I took the book home - slightly shamed that I hadn't realized it was more for coffee tables than actual reading.But then I picked it up and read a couple. And a couple more. Next thing I know, a couple of days later the book is done - and I really enjoyed it. ...And I learned a lot. Well presumably.I did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroe's math. Or any of his conclusions. I mean, if I did on a couple of these, there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right? If I could take issue with a couple... I am NOT a math guy.In case there aren't any flame wars yet, let me start one: On page 114 in answer to the question, ""If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?"" he says, ""The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit. These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses. After a few days, your immune system notices and destroys it, but not before you infect, on average, one other person."" Then he has a footnote which reads, ""Mathematically, this must be true. If the average were less than one, the virus would die out. If it were more than one, eventually everyone would have a cold all the time. But that can't be right? Can it? It's tough to tell whether he's serious or not, because sometimes the footnotes are jokes, and other times they're not.But here, it made me question the math of the rest of the book. He's very meticulous in his calculations throughout, but here he doesn't factor in seasons, or how vast the globe is... Wouldn't it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection - and then people stay away from us - and are more cautious in general - which is why the number goes back down but doesn't die out completely?It took me a while to get over this, undermining the whole book for a couple seconds. Seriously, if he had just said ""but not before you infect, on average, on other person."" I wouldn't have thought twice about it.Of course, I doubted him on other footnotes: pg 134 ""Although it'sa little different, if you drip superglue on cotton thread, it will catch fire."" That can't be right can it? That's another of his jokes? Right?Munroe also interspersed ""Weird (and worrying) questions from the what if? inbox. ...Honestly, most of these weren't any weirder than the questions he was already answering. And sometimes I think they only seemed weird, but I think he may have missed the trail.Like on page 236, the question is, ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?""There's a stick figure that says ...""Asking for a friend... former friend, I mean.""But I think it's a legitimate question. And I'm pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM. - wasn't it a major plot point? So, Thomas, (the person who asked the question) wherever you are - I don't think you're a weirdo. (...Yeah, yeah, yeah... spoiler alert, if you're reading this in 1996... Although, I'd be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time, it's Munroe. He's sure studying that stuff. And Einstein. And Schrodinger. Also, probably J. Robert Oppenheimer.) And the book is so dated. He mentions the ""new-fangled writing section"" of the SAT on page 278. That was dropped way back in 2016. - Time travelling - am I right?Finally, Munroe - if you're reading this - and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already. You may hate it, but don't knock it till you've tried it, right?Seriously - loved the book. Thought I would like it, didn't think I would love it. Didn't think I would read it the whole way through - finished it in under 3 days....Also, shouldn't this go under like... a sci-fi shelf? Since the questions are hypothetical... Isn't this exactly what science-fiction is? It's just not told in narrative form in this case?"

The answers are sometimes tongue-in-cheek, but there is the spirit of serious scientific investigation (experiment - observation - interpretation) in each: accompanied by his signature stick figures and one-liners, they are a delight to read.Some sample questions:""What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light?""""How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space was created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean?

What per cent of submitted reviews would end with a completed sentence?Well, this amounts to the question of, what per cent of reviewers would simply stop typing when the time ran out, instead of finishing up what they were saying and ignoring the stupid rule.But there could be a correlation (or inverse correlation?) between how reviewers reacted to such a rule, and the day job they had – or the “purity” of the field they worked in. At any rate, let’s see …Random time in the interval 45 minutes to 75 minutes: 53:51I’d better turn off the baseball game. Right.Okay, the clock is started,Author Randall Munroe writes the on-line comic strip xkcd. (See example above.)https://xkcd.com/On the site, it’s billed as A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. There’s a lot of casual references to computer stuff too. Munroe used to work at NASA as a physicist (I think), then decided to do this other gig. The gags he draws range from single frame, to three frames, to multiple frames extended down your computer screen – sometimes with rafts of text in table form, or anything else that he thinks appropriate for the laugh he’s aiming at.A couple hints for looking at xkcd.1) The humans are always drawn as stick figures. Their gender is shown by types of hairdos on the females. In the strip above, the sociologist, chemist, and mathematician are girls. Obviously.2) By hovering your mouse over the picture (not clicking) a “bonus punch line” (my phrase) will appear. (That won't happen with the cartoon above.)44:03the bookThe secondary title is SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.There might be about 60 of the Question/ANSWER articles in the book. (No time to count them.) Interspersed with these are a dozen single page pieces called “Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox”. Each page has a couple questions, with no response by the author, except for sometimes a cartoon drawing, a stick figure saying something. etc.Here’s a quite worrying example, #6Q. What is the total nutritional value (calories, fat, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the average human body? – Justin RisnerQ. What temperature would a chainsaw (or other cutting implement) need to be at to instantly cauterize any injuries inflicted with it? – Sylvia Gallaher(These are probably the worst in the book.) One of these that I wished he had answered was this one.Q. What if every day, every human had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a human? - KennethThe main entries are 3-5 pages long, mostly text, some cartoons accompanying. It’s often hard to anticipate where Munroe will go with a question.One item is called No More DNA. The question is, “This may be a bit gruesome, but … if someone’s DNA suddenly vanished, how long would that person last?”Munroe notes that the average person would be about a third of a pound lighter, then gives a list of several ways that one can lose that amount of weight easier [more safely too!] – such as peeing. When he gets to seriously addressing the question, he says, “To get an idea of what it might be like, lets turn to mushroom poisonings.” Specifically – the Amanita bisporigera. The several related species (from America and Europe) are called by the name destroying angel. These mushrooms contain amatoxin, which binds to an enzyme that is used to read information from DNA. “It hobbles the enzyme, effectively interrupting the process by which cells follow DNA’s instructions.” The amatoxin causes irreversible damage to whatever cells it collects in, in its case, the liver and kidney. There is a walking ghost phase of Amanita poisoning, where the person seems to get better – but their cells are accumulating irreversible and lethal damage. Munroe says this is probably similar to what might happen in the case of the absurd question being answered.Other examples of DNA damage he talks about are from radiation and chemotherapy.I was appropriately horrified by this piece, but I learned about a mushroom I’d never known of, that apparently can be found in the area I live in. SO I now know what it looks like, having searched it out. (Not that I eat wild mushrooms.)Most of the questions are not this disturbing, though they are equally absurd.How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?How much space does the physical internet take up?If you call a random phone number and say “God bless you,” what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed?The book is like a box of assorted chocolates. You can never tell what you’ll find inside one. It might be scary, it might be funny; it might be just plain fascinating, you might learn something really strange. You very well might want to read parts of it to your partner (share the candy). Any or all, as well as other flavors not mentioned.But the best thing about this book is to just leave it around. Pick it up and flip to a page when you have guests. Or pick it up when you have nothing better to do, and eat one of the candies again!

What the hell are you doing here listening to me blab on? xkcd.comFor all those people still here, and who obviously know Randall's work, let's just bask in the mixture of intelligence, cleverness, hilarity and properly labelled axes. All the nerd girls want to sleep with him and all nerd boys want to sleep with him too...be him.So it seems like he has been running a column on his website where people suggest extreme scientific hypotheticals and he tries to make sense of them and work out what would happen using his extreme knowledge of math and physics. I obviously have not been to observant because this book is the first I have heard of it. I guess I'm a bit of a shit fan. Hang on, I payed him for the book. Best fan ever.The book is a collection of questions he has answered as well as questions he did not answer for the good of society as a whole. Answered questions include ""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?"" and ""How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?"". These are the questions that I always ask while out in the world but I tend to forget as soon as I'm home. Or out of the shower. Definitely shower thoughts.Questions not answered include ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?"" and ""How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the belly button by a cheese cutting wire?"" It's fun to laugh along with these, but it does make you realise that there is a fine line between scientist and horribly obscene psycho killers. Mad scientists are common in literature while Mad Florists not so much. So this is the book for those readers who are tired of the science question and answer compendiums full of ""Why is the sky blue?"". I adored it and I want more. "

I mean periodic tables and radioactive decay doesn't normally warrant laughter-well at least when I read about it. The questions being presented is stuff that would have never crossed my mind, but the instant I read them I was like -oh wow-what the funk if that really happened? I loved the illustrations throughout- and how the scientific info was made into such a fun, yet informative read. For sure checking out more stuff by Munroe."

The book was fun to read until at some points it wasn’t. The author is apparently a genius, I don’t know how can he think in that way. And the dedication and time that he puts to answer these questions is amazing.I imagine the author as that student who used to sit at the front seat and answer all the questions enthusiastically.My problem was that not all the questions were simple and even if they were or if he answered them simply, he would go and make it more and more complicated until I lost interest. Still an entertaining book, specially for the science nerds!"

If you have bought a kindle Fire, then you know that Amazon fills the box with little 'tutorials'. *cough* ads in a pretty package*cough* Anyway, What If was on the pamphlet of books to read. It looked at it and thought interesting. I later read a book called 'Know it all', a book that asked and answered scientific questions. I loved it and wanted more. So I got this. It is sooo fascinating. It is full of questions that are logical yet so hard to answer. It had so many things I had been wondering myself!

19,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"This book was equal parts hilarious and utter nightmare fuel. I have never had such an emotionally confusing reading experience. One second, snorting my drink up my nose from laughter, the next trying to shove down the sudden and complete terror I'm experiencing because I've been forced to imagine trying to survive in six atmospheres of pressure brought upon by an expanding Earth, or collapsing into a pile of human goo because I've lost my DNA, and doing so has reminded me of my mortality and oh there goes a panic attack WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE OF LIGHTNING AND RADIATION POISONING AND THEN GET EATEN BY CATS. Unlikely potential experiences, to be sure, but that's why you don't give someone like me a book like this. Unlikely experiences are just as easy to imagine and fear irrationally and without control as likely ones, and they only stimulate the bad parts of my imagination. I am now more afraid of a global windstorm brought on by the cessation of the Earth's rotation potentially killing all life on Earth than I am of being murdered or getting a fatal disease.All that is to say, I am most likely not this book's target audience, being a completely ridiculous ball of anxiety over things that nearly 100% will never, ever, ever happen. (I have been reading XKCD since college, though. It is a constant fixture in my life, and is not terrifying.)As a result, it's hard to quantify my experience with this book. So let's add up the points:+5 stars for being so smart and clever and creative-5 stars for answering all the questions where we all die and/or the Earth is destroyed+1 star for including the weird and worrying questions from the inbox that he refused to answer--we should know our limits, people-1 star for being entirely too preoccupied with questions that involve danger+1 star for my favorite question in the book, the one about calling random people on the telephone and saying ""God Bless You,"" hoping to get someone who's just sneezed-1 star for not having more ridiculous questions like that instead of ones where all your blood is drawn out of your finger by a ridiculously high density bullet, forming a giant blood bubble around said bullet and killing you-1000 stars for me waiting the entire fucking book for the question involving the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlacc pit. This question does not exist. I have been lied to.+999 stars for the extremely obscure Kyp Durron reference that only 1 out of every 100,000 people will get (or some other number that hasn't been pulled out of my ass)+1 star for every other Star Wars reference, all of which were clever and relevant+1 star for the funny illustrations+1 star for the recurring joke about the Netherlands (and the way he incorporates things like that into all his answers)-1 star for not including in the Human Computer chapter the obvious potential scenario that the little girl was trying to lasso the cat, and the vase was knocked over in the confusion +1 star for SCIENCE!!-1 star for MATH :(+1 stars for ending the book on a happy note, ""Sometimes it's nice not to destroy the world for a change.""+1 star because the stars I ended up with didn't seem like enoughYou can do the math for yourselves. Or, you know, look up at my star rating there."

21,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Randall Munroe is a dangerous guy. Seriously dangerous. He is the author of the online comic strip xkcd. It's about math, science, hacking, logic, and a host of wonderfully nerdy subjects. But in this book, Munroe answers a stack of absurd hypothetical questions. Some of the questions are really crazy, like ""What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?"" Munroe explains that the ""thud"" as everyone came down at the same time wouldn't amount to much. But, the aftermath would be catastrophic.But what's really crazy, is how Munroe takes bland questions and hypes them into incredible zingers. For example, ""If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?"" The answer, of course, is ""no"". But Munroe never stops with an answer like that. He ups the ante, increasing the power of the laser pointers, to the point where he becomes really dangerous!What is truly wonderful about this book, is that the answers are explained with scientific reasoning. Occasionally the answers are speculative, but this is clearly spelled out. Munroe usually applies scientific principles to answer the questions correctly, regardless of the level of absurdity. And, the questions and answers are all illustrated with his stick-figure cartoons, adding appreciably to the humor."
22,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"Q. What if _____?A. Nearly Everyone Would Die!- Randall Munroe, What If? There are certain things on this planet that you seemed to do fine without, but as soon as you discover, you can't now do without. Diet Dr. Pepper, David Foster Wallace, dark chocolate covered cherries all fit into this category. So, too, does Randall Munroe. He seems to occupy a space near, but not on, that vacated by Gary Larson when the great Gary Larson stopped drawing the Far Side (January 1, 1995). If you are unimpressed by Gary Larsen or the Far Side or do not know who he is or what I'm talking about, hell man, read no further. This book is not for you. I'm not trying to suggest that Gary Larson and Randall Munroe occupy the same ground. They are very different. Their approach to science is different. Their technique. However, the Venn Diagram of those readers of Gary Larson 20+ years ago would closely resemble those readers of Randall Munroe's xkcd. Nerds. They are both worshiped by nerds. They are nerd gods. In this godhead of scientific nerd entertainers also exists Bill Nye. Anyway, these are binary science artists. You either get them and love them or you don't. If you don't, well congrats, I really hope someday you will recognized what you did to our beautiful world by voting for Trump. Bastard. Anyway, this book. This book is filled with drawings and explanations by Randall Munroe on topics as diverse as:""Q. What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?""""Q. What would happen if you were to gather a mole (unit of measurement) of moles (the small furry critter) in one place?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How high can a human throw something?""Here is the magic of this book, and why it is relevant and important. It is the essentials of science. Science is always jumping into absurd places asking weird questions. Monroe capture the joy of this experience and he integrates the reader into it. He is a translator (like most scientists are) of complex methods into a narrative of explanation. He just takes several absurd, but still logical steps further. I find his book about one standard deviation better than similar attempts at similar things. I'm thinking of Leyner's books: Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour. Both are using humor and science and the strategy of funky questions. There are a couple differences, that matter. Mark Leyner isn't a scientist. He's a soft postmodernist author that is playing doctor explaining awkward questons. Monroe is a scientist that is using the scientific method and humor to explain absurd, and sometimes practically nonsense questions. While both of these books can be considered humor books, I tend to favor the one written by a scientist who can draw (kinda) dinosaurs and a pyramid of giraffes. Personal preference I guess. Anyway, if you or anyone in your family is a nerd, or raising a nerd, and enjoy absurdity and funky questions, well, this is almost a perfect book. If not, go ahead and try and to convince me that your vote for Trump isn't going to be considered the beginning of the end of our civilization. You have no soul. "
23,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Update: He published a lot more that aren't in this book. Read them for free here:http://what-if.xkcd.com/archive/So... I love xkcd & some of these questions were really interesting - funny on the face with some really interesting science & math backing up the answer. For instance, the bullet being hit by lightning got into quite a few interesting facts about lightning. Who wouldn't want to know if a machine gun jet pack would work including discussions on caliber, barrel burn out, & fire rates? Cooking a steak via a high altitude drop wasn't nearly as crazy as a mole of moles, but they would make an interesting planetoid. I never would have thought of that on my own. This isn't a book to just sit down & read. The questions & answers often require contemplation. Yoda powered houses probably won't catch on, but discovering just what his maximum power output was when he picked Luke's X-wing out of the swamp got into equations about power & how many Yodas it would take to power our civilization. Sure, I learned them in 9th grade physics, but the refresher was a whole lot more interesting than Ms. Hummel's class ever was. (Sorry, Ms. Hummel. Your class was interesting & figuring out horsepower by running up a flight of stairs was great, but... well... Yoda. Yes, I know your class was long before even the first Star Wars movie, but... Yoda-power. How green can you get?)And then there are the Weird & Worrying Questions sections that dotted this odd amalgamation. Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee? is fairly horrifying, but whatever turns you on. Is it possible to cry so much you dehydrate yourself? is sad, but they're still pure entertainment for me. If I were Munroe & had to worry about the people sending those emails, I might well disconnect from society & move to the middle of northern Alberta, Canada. You think I exaggerate? How many houses are burned down in the United States every year? What would be the easiest way to increase that number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)? How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Eeek! There are some scary people out there!Highly recommended in small doses!"

But to my dismay, I don't think that he fully appreciated the genius of it, but well... some people are colorblind. Life is sometimes cruel like that. Anyway, this book was great. I've been a fan of XKCD for a long time now, and even if this book was crap, I'd have happily purchased a copy just to support Randall Munroe for my previous webcomic enjoyment. But this book was not crap. It was great. Interesting question content, well-thought out and researched answers, just the right mixture of humor to balance out the brain 'splody math stuff... I loved it. I'm going to give this book three awards: First, for best comedic use of [citation needed]. Second, for best usage of footnote text EVAR.

What If?, or Serendipity; or the Literary/Pop Culture Quotes Quiz
Late at night, about a week ago, I went through the Top Quotes pages of Goodreads. A hundred pages, each with thirty quotes: that's 3000 quotes. I have problems. I was searching for quotes that included (on the most part, primarily consisted of) a line in the form of 'If A, B' (let's call it an If quote, or IQ) - I'd compiled them because I had a certain idea for a review where I would use them.What's the catch? The idea was for the review of another book - not What If?. But the day after the nighttime scavenging, I decided against using it because my sense of reviewing aesthetics decided to go with another idea. The result was that I had all these IQ's sitting in a file on my desktop, but they were left completely untouched because I didn't plan to use them any more, while regretting how I should have thought about it more before compiling them in the first place.Fast forward a week, and today I finished Munroe's book. I hadn't really thought about reviewing it (immediately, anyway), but tonight I glanced at the book the review of which the IQ's were meant for on my desk, and it hit me.What If? questions. If... quotes. So I'm able to use my dear IQ's for a review after all. Ladies and gentlemen, that's serendipity for you.From the 3000 quotes, there were a surprising amount of IQ's. I'd estimate there were 60 or so quotes including an If... line (citation needed), of which I had copied 45 of into my file for their quality and validity of use in my review for that other book. I'd like to make it 50 for a nicer number but no artificial perfectionism here - science needs integrity.Here's how the IQ's fit into this review:1. I give you the first half of each IQ (the If A).2. You'll also be given the author of the quote.3. Your task is to see how many of the B's you can fill out. The answers are hidden under the spoiler tags. Better leave peeking at the answer for after you've answered a series by the same author since they might be a giveaway.4. Write your test score /45 in the comments section (give me some love, joy and social validation). For the answers, if they are relatively close you can give yourself the mark.5.

Update:
 This is my first experience in reading a book in paper-copy and having it actually change how much I enjoyed it. A friend who knows me all too well gave me the hardcover version of What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions as a birthday present- and reading it as an ebook just didn't do it justice. The laugh-factor jumped by several orders of magnitude! So here's to Randal Munroe, XKCD and keeping physical books alive!The brain behind 

xkcd

, 

Randall Munroe

, has been churning out even more than his nerdy and hilarious stick-figure comics. This wunderkind also answers to imaginative queries submitted by us lay-folk in 

What if?

, a sort of xkcd sub-blog. So, yes, this is a book-ified blog, which isn't always a bad thing. I actually hadn't really followed the blog prior to reading the book, and was surprised by the balance Munroe is able to strike to make his answers both “scientific” and accessible. Any curious kid could enjoy the book, and the same goes for adults (though if you're hoping for rigorous calculations you will be disappointed).  The weird thing about hypothetical questions, though, is that depending on your audience, sometimes the answer you'll get is ‘Who cares?’ And, for whatever reason, my interest arbitrarily waxed and waned. For example: - Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward firing machine guns? Fascinating! Do tell...

- What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power was turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1 meter box? Better question: Why would you ever want to know that?

I found easily three-quarters of the questions interesting, so I won't dock serious points for that, and that wouldn't be problematic if I were more of a browser-type reader.  Of course, extra love added for a veritable rolling mental montage of 
Archer
 tie-ins. The 
Weightless Arrow
 question (something to the effect of: would the friction of air eventually stop an arrow in a zero-gravity environment?) could be easily answered by my favorite world's greatest secret agent.

And... y'know... taunt people on the internet. And it worked. I got an early copy. And I treasured it. I petted it. It was precious to me. Precious. Then life got in the way. Conventions. Promotion for my own book launch. I had dad stuff to do. I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser. Then I had my book tour.... Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did. "
32,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?"

  Trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.
Randall Munroe, ex-NASA employee and author of the wildly popular webcomic XKCD, decides to look at several, undoubtedly, absurd questions and find scientific answers to them.Nothing is too absurd for him - whether it be the logistics of finding your soulmate to what happens if our moon suddenly disappears - Munroe answers it all.
But I’ve never seen the Icarus story as a lesson about the limitations of humans. I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.
I absolutely loved the tone of voice throughout the book. 
There’s no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word “NO” scrawled over and over in charred blood.
His hilarious deadpan just absolutely cinched this book for me. 
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.
 
Who knew that physics could be so fun? 
Honestly, teachers need to stop the whole calculate-the-gravity-of-a-falling-ball shtick and jump on the calculate-the-force-of-wind-turbines-powered-by-people-at-a-gym bandwagon. Seriously, just make learning fun and the rest will go from there.In short - yes! Loved this one - it was so much fun!Audiobook CommentsI absolutely LOVED how you can just feel the enthusiasm coming from the reader.

36,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya,5,"“But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”Randall Munroe of xkcd.com fame (a former physicist and NASA robotics employee turned brilliant comics artist) can come to my house for tea and in-depth discussion of hypothetical scenarios based on the world’s dumbest questions (while showing me his back-of-the-napkin math which I will blindly believe as it will just whoosh over my head like a jet plane) any time. Dear Mr. Munroe, please consider this a standing invitation.When I was five, I was trying to figure out how difficult it would be to reach the Moon if I were to stack chairs on top of each other (for a head start, beginning this enterprise from the roof of a 9-story building). I was sure about a 1000 would do. I should have just contacted Randall Munroe.
 “DISCLAIMER: Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind.”
This book will provide you with detailed physics and mathematics solutions to a plethora of …ahem… interesting questions. I picked a few just to convey to you how deep the sheer awesomeness of ‘What If’ goes.——————————————————————
 “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?”
Munroe approaches this very important question with scientific rigor. After consulting literature on the steak drag coefficient, US military studies from the Cold War era, “research papers on the heating of ICBM nose cones as they reenter the atmosphere” and a cookbook (duh!), making an assumption that “Steaks can probably survive breaking the sound barrier”, and after making amazing graphs such as the one below …

 … he finally comes to the obvious conclusion that “we should drop the steak over Pittsburgh” (because of the tradition of “Pittsburgh rare” steaks there), and our elegant answer is:
 “So drop your steak from a suborbital rocket, send out a collection team to recover it, brush it off, reheat it, cut away any badly charred sections, and dig in.Just watch out for salmonella. And the Andromeda Strain.”
—————————————
 “How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?”
Some simple models clearly give you the only plausible answer: Netherlands will become a supraplanetary entity. To see how, you need to read for yourself.


“Supposing you did drain the oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?”
Again, the answer is clear — it’s a future that will be Netherlands-shaped:
—————————————
“What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?”
Brief answer: “NEARLY EVERYONE WOULD DIE. Then things would get interesting.”—————————————
 “What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?”
Answer: “Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.”
—————————————
 “How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?”

“Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90 percent of the speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.”———————————
 “How much Force power can Yoda output?”
“I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.”
After a fair share of assumptions and equations, it’s blatantly obvious that Yoda is a much better power source than Luke Skywalker. But a word of caution before we change our power grid to Yoda-based: “So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would definitely be green.”5 stars. If I’m ever shipwrecked on a remote island, I hope to have this book with me — maybe somewhere in its depths there’s a calculation of how long I can last before resorting to cannibalism."
37,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seen:""Do not try any of this at home.

The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting, directly or indirectly, from information contained in this book.""That disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science: Dangerous ideas ahead, folks! Don't get too close -- these things could kill ya!Randall Munroe used to work at NASA, and now he creates the webcomic XKCD (which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig). On his website, he takes ""absurd hypothetical questions"" from readers and tries to answer some of them. Here are some of my favorite questions in this book:What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?Which US state is actually flown over the most?Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?How high can a human throw something?How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?When, if ever, will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?How many Lego bricks would it take to build a bridge capable of carrying traffic from London to New York? Have that many Lego bricks been manufactured?What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?If you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions, this book is for you! What made this so much fun, aside from the ridiculous questions, is Munroe's sense of humor. Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers, which is not something that usually happens when I'm reading about science. Oh, and be sure to read his footnotes, which have even more jokes.I think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works. I think I would have loved it when I was 10. *I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book, because I had never heard of the author before. It's the miracle of Goodreads! "
38,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"Mr Munroe includes some “weird and worrying” questions from his website’s inbox which he presents without attempting to answer – one favourite was:If you saved a whole life’s worth of kissing and used all that suction power on one single kiss, how much suction force would that single kiss have?I guess the answer might be “what pharmaceutical products have you ingested during the last four hours?” or “May I speak to your parents?”Another person named Jon Merrill askedHow fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Answer has to be “as fast as I will be running if I ever meet you Jon”.And a person called Kenneth askedWhat if every day, every human had a 1 per cent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a one percent chance of being turned into a human?  Randall does not provide a response to that one but I would have said Kenneth, if only life were like that. Wouldn’t it be fabulous?Everybody likes this book and I liked half of it, the other half was so far over my head it might have been a distant Andean condor croaking Sanskrit into a Bluetooth headset. Some of the stuff Randall devotes pages of detailed analysis to did not tickle my ivories, likeWhat would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put into an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? I mean, get a life. Who the flook cares about a hair dryer in a box? But many are very interesting. He tackles the old chestnutWhat would happen of everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same time?  He picks Rhode Island (it’s just big enough for everyone on Earth, surprisingly) as a designated place where this event might be staged, and imagines the result. In regard to the jump and the landing itself, not so much would result. But then he imagines the implications of all those people trying to get back home from Rhode Island. It’s terrible – it’s an apocalypse. If this mass jumping event was actually staged it would cause the immediate termination of civilisation and the death of billions. The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Yes it is a nice book but I do not recommend that you wolf down this book as I did in 2 days, because it’s like TOO MUCH and it can get annoying. You keep thinking of your own absurd questions – How many soldier ants would it take to chew through my leg in one hour? And would I survive? And really, there is one question which I really want to ask Randall, it’s actually been something I have been wondering about for a long time – you know those vending machines stuffed full of really unhealthy chocs and crisps and cokes? Well, imagine a person was chained to one of those and had an infinite amount of small change within arms reach. Then imagine the vending machine gets refilled by the usual contractor in the usual way (who never notices the chained person). So : how long would it take the captive to die from a constant diet of crap? If they were only eating chocs and crisps and drinking cokes? A month? Six months? A YEAR?? It’s really bugging me. I may have to launch a practical experiment. "

But hey, why the heck not? Right? XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famous.The book comes from his ""what if"" blog, which is also very good.I took the book into work with me to show it around - you know - hipster-esque and what not. I'm reading this trendy, new book first.But the guys at my table were all like, ""Yeah... I can see myself reading like 2 or 3 of these and then putting the book down..."" Everyone more or less nodded in agreement - even though they thought the book was cool.Then I looked at the book a little bit more closely, flipped through a little bit and thought, ""Huh... that sounds about right. That's probably what I'm going to do...""I'll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions... This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly. You know: ""But what if Hitler hadn't killed the Jews? Would you like him then?"" or ""What if Martin Luther King Jr. had used violence? You have to admit, it's pretty crazy that we've given this guy a holiday, right?"" He has a point.So, I took the book home - slightly shamed that I hadn't realized it was more for coffee tables than actual reading.But then I picked it up and read a couple. And a couple more. Next thing I know, a couple of days later the book is done - and I really enjoyed it. ...And I learned a lot. Well presumably.I did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroe's math. Or any of his conclusions. I mean, if I did on a couple of these, there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right? If I could take issue with a couple... I am NOT a math guy.In case there aren't any flame wars yet, let me start one: On page 114 in answer to the question, ""If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?"" he says, ""The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit. These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses. After a few days, your immune system notices and destroys it, but not before you infect, on average, one other person."" Then he has a footnote which reads, ""Mathematically, this must be true. If the average were less than one, the virus would die out. If it were more than one, eventually everyone would have a cold all the time. But that can't be right? Can it? It's tough to tell whether he's serious or not, because sometimes the footnotes are jokes, and other times they're not.But here, it made me question the math of the rest of the book. He's very meticulous in his calculations throughout, but here he doesn't factor in seasons, or how vast the globe is... Wouldn't it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection - and then people stay away from us - and are more cautious in general - which is why the number goes back down but doesn't die out completely?It took me a while to get over this, undermining the whole book for a couple seconds. Seriously, if he had just said ""but not before you infect, on average, on other person."" I wouldn't have thought twice about it.Of course, I doubted him on other footnotes: pg 134 ""Although it'sa little different, if you drip superglue on cotton thread, it will catch fire."" That can't be right can it? That's another of his jokes? Right?Munroe also interspersed ""Weird (and worrying) questions from the what if? inbox. ...Honestly, most of these weren't any weirder than the questions he was already answering. And sometimes I think they only seemed weird, but I think he may have missed the trail.Like on page 236, the question is, ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?""There's a stick figure that says ...""Asking for a friend... former friend, I mean.""But I think it's a legitimate question. And I'm pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM. - wasn't it a major plot point? So, Thomas, (the person who asked the question) wherever you are - I don't think you're a weirdo. (...Yeah, yeah, yeah... spoiler alert, if you're reading this in 1996... Although, I'd be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time, it's Munroe. He's sure studying that stuff. And Einstein. And Schrodinger. Also, probably J. Robert Oppenheimer.) And the book is so dated. He mentions the ""new-fangled writing section"" of the SAT on page 278. That was dropped way back in 2016. - Time travelling - am I right?Finally, Munroe - if you're reading this - and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already. You may hate it, but don't knock it till you've tried it, right?Seriously - loved the book. Thought I would like it, didn't think I would love it. Didn't think I would read it the whole way through - finished it in under 3 days....Also, shouldn't this go under like... a sci-fi shelf? Since the questions are hypothetical... Isn't this exactly what science-fiction is? It's just not told in narrative form in this case?"

What per cent of submitted reviews would end with a completed sentence?Well, this amounts to the question of, what per cent of reviewers would simply stop typing when the time ran out, instead of finishing up what they were saying and ignoring the stupid rule.But there could be a correlation (or inverse correlation?) between how reviewers reacted to such a rule, and the day job they had – or the “purity” of the field they worked in. At any rate, let’s see …Random time in the interval 45 minutes to 75 minutes: 53:51I’d better turn off the baseball game. Right.Okay, the clock is started,Author Randall Munroe writes the on-line comic strip xkcd. (See example above.)https://xkcd.com/On the site, it’s billed as A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. There’s a lot of casual references to computer stuff too. Munroe used to work at NASA as a physicist (I think), then decided to do this other gig. The gags he draws range from single frame, to three frames, to multiple frames extended down your computer screen – sometimes with rafts of text in table form, or anything else that he thinks appropriate for the laugh he’s aiming at.A couple hints for looking at xkcd.1) The humans are always drawn as stick figures. Their gender is shown by types of hairdos on the females. In the strip above, the sociologist, chemist, and mathematician are girls. Obviously.2) By hovering your mouse over the picture (not clicking) a “bonus punch line” (my phrase) will appear. (That won't happen with the cartoon above.)44:03the bookThe secondary title is SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.There might be about 60 of the Question/ANSWER articles in the book. (No time to count them.) Interspersed with these are a dozen single page pieces called “Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox”. Each page has a couple questions, with no response by the author, except for sometimes a cartoon drawing, a stick figure saying something. etc.Here’s a quite worrying example, #6Q. What is the total nutritional value (calories, fat, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the average human body? – Justin RisnerQ. What temperature would a chainsaw (or other cutting implement) need to be at to instantly cauterize any injuries inflicted with it? – Sylvia Gallaher(These are probably the worst in the book.) One of these that I wished he had answered was this one.Q. What if every day, every human had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a human? - KennethThe main entries are 3-5 pages long, mostly text, some cartoons accompanying. It’s often hard to anticipate where Munroe will go with a question.One item is called No More DNA. The question is, “This may be a bit gruesome, but … if someone’s DNA suddenly vanished, how long would that person last?”Munroe notes that the average person would be about a third of a pound lighter, then gives a list of several ways that one can lose that amount of weight easier [more safely too!] – such as peeing. When he gets to seriously addressing the question, he says, “To get an idea of what it might be like, lets turn to mushroom poisonings.” Specifically – the Amanita bisporigera. The several related species (from America and Europe) are called by the name destroying angel. These mushrooms contain amatoxin, which binds to an enzyme that is used to read information from DNA. “It hobbles the enzyme, effectively interrupting the process by which cells follow DNA’s instructions.” The amatoxin causes irreversible damage to whatever cells it collects in, in its case, the liver and kidney. There is a walking ghost phase of Amanita poisoning, where the person seems to get better – but their cells are accumulating irreversible and lethal damage. Munroe says this is probably similar to what might happen in the case of the absurd question being answered.Other examples of DNA damage he talks about are from radiation and chemotherapy.I was appropriately horrified by this piece, but I learned about a mushroom I’d never known of, that apparently can be found in the area I live in. SO I now know what it looks like, having searched it out. (Not that I eat wild mushrooms.)Most of the questions are not this disturbing, though they are equally absurd.How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?How much space does the physical internet take up?If you call a random phone number and say “God bless you,” what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed?The book is like a box of assorted chocolates. You can never tell what you’ll find inside one. It might be scary, it might be funny; it might be just plain fascinating, you might learn something really strange. You very well might want to read parts of it to your partner (share the candy). Any or all, as well as other flavors not mentioned.But the best thing about this book is to just leave it around. Pick it up and flip to a page when you have guests. Or pick it up when you have nothing better to do, and eat one of the candies again!

45,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"Every nerd knows Randall Munroe from his wildly humourous and insightful xkcd.com comics right? You don't? What the hell are you doing here listening to me blab on? xkcd.comFor all those people still here, and who obviously know Randall's work, let's just bask in the mixture of intelligence, cleverness, hilarity and properly labelled axes. All the nerd girls want to sleep with him and all nerd boys want to sleep with him too...be him.So it seems like he has been running a column on his website where people suggest extreme scientific hypotheticals and he tries to make sense of them and work out what would happen using his extreme knowledge of math and physics. I obviously have not been to observant because this book is the first I have heard of it. I guess I'm a bit of a shit fan. Hang on, I payed him for the book. Best fan ever.The book is a collection of questions he has answered as well as questions he did not answer for the good of society as a whole. Answered questions include ""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?"" and ""How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?"". These are the questions that I always ask while out in the world but I tend to forget as soon as I'm home. Or out of the shower. Definitely shower thoughts.Questions not answered include ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?"" and ""How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the belly button by a cheese cutting wire?"" It's fun to laugh along with these, but it does make you realise that there is a fine line between scientist and horribly obscene psycho killers. Mad scientists are common in literature while Mad Florists not so much. So this is the book for those readers who are tired of the science question and answer compendiums full of ""Why is the sky blue?"". I adored it and I want more. "
46,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,4,"I don't think I've ever laughed this much and hard from a science or non-fiction book-wait, I take that back, I haven't laughed this much from a book period. I mean periodic tables and radioactive decay doesn't normally warrant laughter-well at least when I read about it. The questions being presented is stuff that would have never crossed my mind, but the instant I read them I was like -oh wow-what the funk if that really happened? I loved the illustrations throughout- and how the scientific info was made into such a fun, yet informative read. For sure checking out more stuff by Munroe."
47,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionWhat if is a non-fiction book that -as the name implies- gives answer to some absurd hypothetical questions. The book was fun to read until at some points it wasn’t. The author is apparently a genius, I don’t know how can he think in that way. And the dedication and time that he puts to answer these questions is amazing.I imagine the author as that student who used to sit at the front seat and answer all the questions enthusiastically.My problem was that not all the questions were simple and even if they were or if he answered them simply, he would go and make it more and more complicated until I lost interest. Still an entertaining book, specially for the science nerds!"

Well, kind of. A long time ago, I bought a Kindle Fire. If you have bought a kindle Fire, then you know that Amazon fills the box with little 'tutorials'. *cough* ads in a pretty package*cough* Anyway, What If was on the pamphlet of books to read. It looked at it and thought interesting. I later read a book called 'Know it all', a book that asked and answered scientific questions. I loved it and wanted more. So I got this. It is sooo fascinating. It is full of questions that are logical yet so hard to answer. It had so many things I had been wondering myself! This is most certainly going on my Favorite shelf!| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram"
49,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"This book was equal parts hilarious and utter nightmare fuel. I have never had such an emotionally confusing reading experience. One second, snorting my drink up my nose from laughter, the next trying to shove down the sudden and complete terror I'm experiencing because I've been forced to imagine trying to survive in six atmospheres of pressure brought upon by an expanding Earth, or collapsing into a pile of human goo because I've lost my DNA, and doing so has reminded me of my mortality and oh there goes a panic attack WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE OF LIGHTNING AND RADIATION POISONING AND THEN GET EATEN BY CATS. Unlikely potential experiences, to be sure, but that's why you don't give someone like me a book like this. Unlikely experiences are just as easy to imagine and fear irrationally and without control as likely ones, and they only stimulate the bad parts of my imagination. I am now more afraid of a global windstorm brought on by the cessation of the Earth's rotation potentially killing all life on Earth than I am of being murdered or getting a fatal disease.All that is to say, I am most likely not this book's target audience, being a completely ridiculous ball of anxiety over things that nearly 100% will never, ever, ever happen. (I have been reading XKCD since college, though. It is a constant fixture in my life, and is not terrifying.)As a result, it's hard to quantify my experience with this book. So let's add up the points:+5 stars for being so smart and clever and creative-5 stars for answering all the questions where we all die and/or the Earth is destroyed+1 star for including the weird and worrying questions from the inbox that he refused to answer--we should know our limits, people-1 star for being entirely too preoccupied with questions that involve danger+1 star for my favorite question in the book, the one about calling random people on the telephone and saying ""God Bless You,"" hoping to get someone who's just sneezed-1 star for not having more ridiculous questions like that instead of ones where all your blood is drawn out of your finger by a ridiculously high density bullet, forming a giant blood bubble around said bullet and killing you-1000 stars for me waiting the entire fucking book for the question involving the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlacc pit. This question does not exist. I have been lied to.+999 stars for the extremely obscure Kyp Durron reference that only 1 out of every 100,000 people will get (or some other number that hasn't been pulled out of my ass)+1 star for every other Star Wars reference, all of which were clever and relevant+1 star for the funny illustrations+1 star for the recurring joke about the Netherlands (and the way he incorporates things like that into all his answers)-1 star for not including in the Human Computer chapter the obvious potential scenario that the little girl was trying to lasso the cat, and the vase was knocked over in the confusion +1 star for SCIENCE!!-1 star for MATH :(+1 stars for ending the book on a happy note, ""Sometimes it's nice not to destroy the world for a change.""+1 star because the stars I ended up with didn't seem like enoughYou can do the math for yourselves. Or, you know, look up at my star rating there."
50,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori,5,This is a lot of fun from a guy who likes when things catch fire. A lot of the questions reminded me of the ones Neil Gaiman fielded after Geoff Coffey's tweet that he would donate $1 to @EFF for every person who asks @neilhimself how they can watch American Gods in their country.
51,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Randall Munroe is a dangerous guy. Seriously dangerous. He is the author of the online comic strip xkcd. It's about math, science, hacking, logic, and a host of wonderfully nerdy subjects. But in this book, Munroe answers a stack of absurd hypothetical questions. Some of the questions are really crazy, like ""What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?"" Munroe explains that the ""thud"" as everyone came down at the same time wouldn't amount to much. But, the aftermath would be catastrophic.But what's really crazy, is how Munroe takes bland questions and hypes them into incredible zingers. For example, ""If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?"" The answer, of course, is ""no"". But Munroe never stops with an answer like that. He ups the ante, increasing the power of the laser pointers, to the point where he becomes really dangerous!What is truly wonderful about this book, is that the answers are explained with scientific reasoning. Occasionally the answers are speculative, but this is clearly spelled out. Munroe usually applies scientific principles to answer the questions correctly, regardless of the level of absurdity. And, the questions and answers are all illustrated with his stick-figure cartoons, adding appreciably to the humor."
52,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"Q. What if _____?A. Nearly Everyone Would Die!- Randall Munroe, What If? There are certain things on this planet that you seemed to do fine without, but as soon as you discover, you can't now do without. Diet Dr. Pepper, David Foster Wallace, dark chocolate covered cherries all fit into this category. So, too, does Randall Munroe. He seems to occupy a space near, but not on, that vacated by Gary Larson when the great Gary Larson stopped drawing the Far Side (January 1, 1995). If you are unimpressed by Gary Larsen or the Far Side or do not know who he is or what I'm talking about, hell man, read no further. This book is not for you. I'm not trying to suggest that Gary Larson and Randall Munroe occupy the same ground. They are very different. Their approach to science is different. Their technique. However, the Venn Diagram of those readers of Gary Larson 20+ years ago would closely resemble those readers of Randall Munroe's xkcd. Nerds. They are both worshiped by nerds. They are nerd gods. In this godhead of scientific nerd entertainers also exists Bill Nye. Anyway, these are binary science artists. You either get them and love them or you don't. If you don't, well congrats, I really hope someday you will recognized what you did to our beautiful world by voting for Trump. Bastard. Anyway, this book. This book is filled with drawings and explanations by Randall Munroe on topics as diverse as:""Q. What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?""""Q. What would happen if you were to gather a mole (unit of measurement) of moles (the small furry critter) in one place?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How high can a human throw something?""Here is the magic of this book, and why it is relevant and important. It is the essentials of science. Science is always jumping into absurd places asking weird questions. Monroe capture the joy of this experience and he integrates the reader into it. He is a translator (like most scientists are) of complex methods into a narrative of explanation. He just takes several absurd, but still logical steps further. I find his book about one standard deviation better than similar attempts at similar things. I'm thinking of Leyner's books: Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour. Both are using humor and science and the strategy of funky questions. There are a couple differences, that matter. Mark Leyner isn't a scientist. He's a soft postmodernist author that is playing doctor explaining awkward questons. Monroe is a scientist that is using the scientific method and humor to explain absurd, and sometimes practically nonsense questions. While both of these books can be considered humor books, I tend to favor the one written by a scientist who can draw (kinda) dinosaurs and a pyramid of giraffes. Personal preference I guess. Anyway, if you or anyone in your family is a nerd, or raising a nerd, and enjoy absurdity and funky questions, well, this is almost a perfect book. If not, go ahead and try and to convince me that your vote for Trump isn't going to be considered the beginning of the end of our civilization. You have no soul. "
53,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Update: He published a lot more that aren't in this book. Read them for free here:http://what-if.xkcd.com/archive/So... I love xkcd & some of these questions were really interesting - funny on the face with some really interesting science & math backing up the answer. For instance, the bullet being hit by lightning got into quite a few interesting facts about lightning. Who wouldn't want to know if a machine gun jet pack would work including discussions on caliber, barrel burn out, & fire rates? Cooking a steak via a high altitude drop wasn't nearly as crazy as a mole of moles, but they would make an interesting planetoid. I never would have thought of that on my own. This isn't a book to just sit down & read. The questions & answers often require contemplation. Yoda powered houses probably won't catch on, but discovering just what his maximum power output was when he picked Luke's X-wing out of the swamp got into equations about power & how many Yodas it would take to power our civilization. Sure, I learned them in 9th grade physics, but the refresher was a whole lot more interesting than Ms. Hummel's class ever was. (Sorry, Ms. Hummel. Your class was interesting & figuring out horsepower by running up a flight of stairs was great, but... well... Yoda. Yes, I know your class was long before even the first Star Wars movie, but... Yoda-power. How green can you get?)And then there are the Weird & Worrying Questions sections that dotted this odd amalgamation. Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee? is fairly horrifying, but whatever turns you on. Is it possible to cry so much you dehydrate yourself? is sad, but they're still pure entertainment for me. If I were Munroe & had to worry about the people sending those emails, I might well disconnect from society & move to the middle of northern Alberta, Canada. You think I exaggerate? How many houses are burned down in the United States every year? What would be the easiest way to increase that number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)? How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Eeek! There are some scary people out there!Highly recommended in small doses!"

But to my dismay, I don't think that he fully appreciated the genius of it, but well... some people are colorblind. Life is sometimes cruel like that. Anyway, this book was great. I've been a fan of XKCD for a long time now, and even if this book was crap, I'd have happily purchased a copy just to support Randall Munroe for my previous webcomic enjoyment. But this book was not crap. It was great. Interesting question content, well-thought out and researched answers, just the right mixture of humor to balance out the brain 'splody math stuff... I loved it. I'm going to give this book three awards: First, for best comedic use of [citation needed]. Second, for best usage of footnote text EVAR.

What If?, or Serendipity; or the Literary/Pop Culture Quotes Quiz
Late at night, about a week ago, I went through the Top Quotes pages of Goodreads. A hundred pages, each with thirty quotes: that's 3000 quotes. I have problems. I was searching for quotes that included (on the most part, primarily consisted of) a line in the form of 'If A, B' (let's call it an If quote, or IQ) - I'd compiled them because I had a certain idea for a review where I would use them.What's the catch? The idea was for the review of another book - not What If?. But the day after the nighttime scavenging, I decided against using it because my sense of reviewing aesthetics decided to go with another idea. The result was that I had all these IQ's sitting in a file on my desktop, but they were left completely untouched because I didn't plan to use them any more, while regretting how I should have thought about it more before compiling them in the first place.Fast forward a week, and today I finished Munroe's book. I hadn't really thought about reviewing it (immediately, anyway), but tonight I glanced at the book the review of which the IQ's were meant for on my desk, and it hit me.What If? questions. If... quotes. So I'm able to use my dear IQ's for a review after all. Ladies and gentlemen, that's serendipity for you.From the 3000 quotes, there were a surprising amount of IQ's. I'd estimate there were 60 or so quotes including an If... line (citation needed), of which I had copied 45 of into my file for their quality and validity of use in my review for that other book. I'd like to make it 50 for a nicer number but no artificial perfectionism here - science needs integrity.Here's how the IQ's fit into this review:1. I give you the first half of each IQ (the If A).2. You'll also be given the author of the quote.3. Your task is to see how many of the B's you can fill out. The answers are hidden under the spoiler tags. Better leave peeking at the answer for after you've answered a series by the same author since they might be a giveaway.4. Write your test score /45 in the comments section (give me some love, joy and social validation). For the answers, if they are relatively close you can give yourself the mark.5.

Update:
 This is my first experience in reading a book in paper-copy and having it actually change how much I enjoyed it. A friend who knows me all too well gave me the hardcover version of What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions as a birthday present- and reading it as an ebook just didn't do it justice. The laugh-factor jumped by several orders of magnitude! So here's to Randal Munroe, XKCD and keeping physical books alive!The brain behind 

xkcd

, 

Randall Munroe

, has been churning out even more than his nerdy and hilarious stick-figure comics. This wunderkind also answers to imaginative queries submitted by us lay-folk in 

What if?

, a sort of xkcd sub-blog. So, yes, this is a book-ified blog, which isn't always a bad thing. I actually hadn't really followed the blog prior to reading the book, and was surprised by the balance Munroe is able to strike to make his answers both “scientific” and accessible. Any curious kid could enjoy the book, and the same goes for adults (though if you're hoping for rigorous calculations you will be disappointed).  The weird thing about hypothetical questions, though, is that depending on your audience, sometimes the answer you'll get is ‘Who cares?’ And, for whatever reason, my interest arbitrarily waxed and waned. For example: - Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward firing machine guns? Fascinating! Do tell...

- What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power was turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1 meter box? Better question: Why would you ever want to know that?

I found easily three-quarters of the questions interesting, so I won't dock serious points for that, and that wouldn't be problematic if I were more of a browser-type reader.  Of course, extra love added for a veritable rolling mental montage of 
Archer
 tie-ins. The 
Weightless Arrow
 question (something to the effect of: would the friction of air eventually stop an arrow in a zero-gravity environment?) could be easily answered by my favorite world's greatest secret agent.

Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did. "
62,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?"

  Trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.
Randall Munroe, ex-NASA employee and author of the wildly popular webcomic XKCD, decides to look at several, undoubtedly, absurd questions and find scientific answers to them.Nothing is too absurd for him - whether it be the logistics of finding your soulmate to what happens if our moon suddenly disappears - Munroe answers it all.
But I’ve never seen the Icarus story as a lesson about the limitations of humans. I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.
I absolutely loved the tone of voice throughout the book. 
There’s no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word “NO” scrawled over and over in charred blood.
His hilarious deadpan just absolutely cinched this book for me. 
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.

Honestly, teachers need to stop the whole calculate-the-gravity-of-a-falling-ball shtick and jump on the calculate-the-force-of-wind-turbines-powered-by-people-at-a-gym bandwagon. Seriously, just make learning fun and the rest will go from there.In short - yes!

66,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya,5,"“But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”Randall Munroe of xkcd.com fame (a former physicist and NASA robotics employee turned brilliant comics artist) can come to my house for tea and in-depth discussion of hypothetical scenarios based on the world’s dumbest questions (while showing me his back-of-the-napkin math which I will blindly believe as it will just whoosh over my head like a jet plane) any time. Dear Mr. Munroe, please consider this a standing invitation.When I was five, I was trying to figure out how difficult it would be to reach the Moon if I were to stack chairs on top of each other (for a head start, beginning this enterprise from the roof of a 9-story building). I was sure about a 1000 would do. I should have just contacted Randall Munroe.
 “DISCLAIMER: Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind.”
This book will provide you with detailed physics and mathematics solutions to a plethora of …ahem… interesting questions. I picked a few just to convey to you how deep the sheer awesomeness of ‘What If’ goes.——————————————————————
 “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?”
Munroe approaches this very important question with scientific rigor. After consulting literature on the steak drag coefficient, US military studies from the Cold War era, “research papers on the heating of ICBM nose cones as they reenter the atmosphere” and a cookbook (duh!), making an assumption that “Steaks can probably survive breaking the sound barrier”, and after making amazing graphs such as the one below …

 … he finally comes to the obvious conclusion that “we should drop the steak over Pittsburgh” (because of the tradition of “Pittsburgh rare” steaks there), and our elegant answer is:
 “So drop your steak from a suborbital rocket, send out a collection team to recover it, brush it off, reheat it, cut away any badly charred sections, and dig in.Just watch out for salmonella. And the Andromeda Strain.”
—————————————
 “How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?”
Some simple models clearly give you the only plausible answer: Netherlands will become a supraplanetary entity. To see how, you need to read for yourself.


“Supposing you did drain the oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?”
Again, the answer is clear — it’s a future that will be Netherlands-shaped:
—————————————
“What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?”
Brief answer: “NEARLY EVERYONE WOULD DIE. Then things would get interesting.”—————————————
 “What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?”
Answer: “Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.”
—————————————
 “How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?”

“Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90 percent of the speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.”———————————
 “How much Force power can Yoda output?”
“I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.”
After a fair share of assumptions and equations, it’s blatantly obvious that Yoda is a much better power source than Luke Skywalker. But a word of caution before we change our power grid to Yoda-based: “So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would definitely be green.”5 stars. If I’m ever shipwrecked on a remote island, I hope to have this book with me — maybe somewhere in its depths there’s a calculation of how long I can last before resorting to cannibalism."
67,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seen:""Do not try any of this at home.

The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting, directly or indirectly, from information contained in this book.""That disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science: Dangerous ideas ahead, folks! Don't get too close -- these things could kill ya!Randall Munroe used to work at NASA, and now he creates the webcomic XKCD (which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig). On his website, he takes ""absurd hypothetical questions"" from readers and tries to answer some of them. Here are some of my favorite questions in this book:What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?Which US state is actually flown over the most?Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?How high can a human throw something?How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?When, if ever, will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?How many Lego bricks would it take to build a bridge capable of carrying traffic from London to New York? Have that many Lego bricks been manufactured?What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?If you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions, this book is for you! What made this so much fun, aside from the ridiculous questions, is Munroe's sense of humor. Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers, which is not something that usually happens when I'm reading about science. Oh, and be sure to read his footnotes, which have even more jokes.I think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works. I think I would have loved it when I was 10. *I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book, because I had never heard of the author before. It's the miracle of Goodreads! "
68,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"Mr Munroe includes some “weird and worrying” questions from his website’s inbox which he presents without attempting to answer – one favourite was:If you saved a whole life’s worth of kissing and used all that suction power on one single kiss, how much suction force would that single kiss have?I guess the answer might be “what pharmaceutical products have you ingested during the last four hours?” or “May I speak to your parents?”Another person named Jon Merrill askedHow fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Answer has to be “as fast as I will be running if I ever meet you Jon”.And a person called Kenneth askedWhat if every day, every human had a 1 per cent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a one percent chance of being turned into a human?  Randall does not provide a response to that one but I would have said Kenneth, if only life were like that. Wouldn’t it be fabulous?Everybody likes this book and I liked half of it, the other half was so far over my head it might have been a distant Andean condor croaking Sanskrit into a Bluetooth headset. Some of the stuff Randall devotes pages of detailed analysis to did not tickle my ivories, likeWhat would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put into an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? I mean, get a life. Who the flook cares about a hair dryer in a box? But many are very interesting. He tackles the old chestnutWhat would happen of everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same time?  He picks Rhode Island (it’s just big enough for everyone on Earth, surprisingly) as a designated place where this event might be staged, and imagines the result. In regard to the jump and the landing itself, not so much would result. But then he imagines the implications of all those people trying to get back home from Rhode Island. It’s terrible – it’s an apocalypse. If this mass jumping event was actually staged it would cause the immediate termination of civilisation and the death of billions. The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Yes it is a nice book but I do not recommend that you wolf down this book as I did in 2 days, because it’s like TOO MUCH and it can get annoying. You keep thinking of your own absurd questions – How many soldier ants would it take to chew through my leg in one hour? And would I survive? And really, there is one question which I really want to ask Randall, it’s actually been something I have been wondering about for a long time – you know those vending machines stuffed full of really unhealthy chocs and crisps and cokes? Well, imagine a person was chained to one of those and had an infinite amount of small change within arms reach. Then imagine the vending machine gets refilled by the usual contractor in the usual way (who never notices the chained person). So : how long would it take the captive to die from a constant diet of crap? If they were only eating chocs and crisps and drinking cokes? A month? Six months? A YEAR?? It’s really bugging me. I may have to launch a practical experiment. "

But hey, why the heck not? Right? XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famous.The book comes from his ""what if"" blog, which is also very good.I took the book into work with me to show it around - you know - hipster-esque and what not. I'm reading this trendy, new book first.But the guys at my table were all like, ""Yeah... I can see myself reading like 2 or 3 of these and then putting the book down..."" Everyone more or less nodded in agreement - even though they thought the book was cool.Then I looked at the book a little bit more closely, flipped through a little bit and thought, ""Huh... that sounds about right. That's probably what I'm going to do...""I'll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions... This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly. You know: ""But what if Hitler hadn't killed the Jews? Would you like him then?"" or ""What if Martin Luther King Jr. had used violence? You have to admit, it's pretty crazy that we've given this guy a holiday, right?"" He has a point.So, I took the book home - slightly shamed that I hadn't realized it was more for coffee tables than actual reading.But then I picked it up and read a couple. And a couple more. Next thing I know, a couple of days later the book is done - and I really enjoyed it. ...And I learned a lot. Well presumably.I did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroe's math. Or any of his conclusions. I mean, if I did on a couple of these, there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right? If I could take issue with a couple... I am NOT a math guy.In case there aren't any flame wars yet, let me start one: On page 114 in answer to the question, ""If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?"" he says, ""The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit. These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses. After a few days, your immune system notices and destroys it, but not before you infect, on average, one other person."" Then he has a footnote which reads, ""Mathematically, this must be true. If the average were less than one, the virus would die out. If it were more than one, eventually everyone would have a cold all the time. But that can't be right? Can it? It's tough to tell whether he's serious or not, because sometimes the footnotes are jokes, and other times they're not.But here, it made me question the math of the rest of the book. He's very meticulous in his calculations throughout, but here he doesn't factor in seasons, or how vast the globe is... Wouldn't it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection - and then people stay away from us - and are more cautious in general - which is why the number goes back down but doesn't die out completely?It took me a while to get over this, undermining the whole book for a couple seconds. Seriously, if he had just said ""but not before you infect, on average, on other person."" I wouldn't have thought twice about it.Of course, I doubted him on other footnotes: pg 134 ""Although it'sa little different, if you drip superglue on cotton thread, it will catch fire."" That can't be right can it? That's another of his jokes? Right?Munroe also interspersed ""Weird (and worrying) questions from the what if? inbox. ...Honestly, most of these weren't any weirder than the questions he was already answering. And sometimes I think they only seemed weird, but I think he may have missed the trail.Like on page 236, the question is, ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?""There's a stick figure that says ...""Asking for a friend... former friend, I mean.""But I think it's a legitimate question. And I'm pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM. - wasn't it a major plot point? So, Thomas, (the person who asked the question) wherever you are - I don't think you're a weirdo. (...Yeah, yeah, yeah... spoiler alert, if you're reading this in 1996... Although, I'd be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time, it's Munroe. He's sure studying that stuff. And Einstein. And Schrodinger. Also, probably J. Robert Oppenheimer.) And the book is so dated. He mentions the ""new-fangled writing section"" of the SAT on page 278. That was dropped way back in 2016. - Time travelling - am I right?Finally, Munroe - if you're reading this - and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already. You may hate it, but don't knock it till you've tried it, right?Seriously - loved the book. Thought I would like it, didn't think I would love it. Didn't think I would read it the whole way through - finished it in under 3 days....Also, shouldn't this go under like... a sci-fi shelf? Since the questions are hypothetical... Isn't this exactly what science-fiction is? It's just not told in narrative form in this case?"

At any rate, let’s see …Random time in the interval 45 minutes to 75 minutes: 53:51I’d better turn off the baseball game. Right.Okay, the clock is started,Author Randall Munroe writes the on-line comic strip xkcd. (See example above.)https://xkcd.com/On the site, it’s billed as A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. There’s a lot of casual references to computer stuff too. Munroe used to work at NASA as a physicist (I think), then decided to do this other gig. The gags he draws range from single frame, to three frames, to multiple frames extended down your computer screen – sometimes with rafts of text in table form, or anything else that he thinks appropriate for the laugh he’s aiming at.A couple hints for looking at xkcd.1) The humans are always drawn as stick figures. Their gender is shown by types of hairdos on the females. In the strip above, the sociologist, chemist, and mathematician are girls. Obviously.2) By hovering your mouse over the picture (not clicking) a “bonus punch line” (my phrase) will appear. (That won't happen with the cartoon above.)44:03the bookThe secondary title is SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.There might be about 60 of the Question/ANSWER articles in the book. (No time to count them.) Interspersed with these are a dozen single page pieces called “Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox”. Each page has a couple questions, with no response by the author, except for sometimes a cartoon drawing, a stick figure saying something. etc.Here’s a quite worrying example, #6Q. What is the total nutritional value (calories, fat, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the average human body? – Justin RisnerQ. What temperature would a chainsaw (or other cutting implement) need to be at to instantly cauterize any injuries inflicted with it? – Sylvia Gallaher(These are probably the worst in the book.) One of these that I wished he had answered was this one.Q. What if every day, every human had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a human? - KennethThe main entries are 3-5 pages long, mostly text, some cartoons accompanying. It’s often hard to anticipate where Munroe will go with a question.One item is called No More DNA. The question is, “This may be a bit gruesome, but … if someone’s DNA suddenly vanished, how long would that person last?”Munroe notes that the average person would be about a third of a pound lighter, then gives a list of several ways that one can lose that amount of weight easier [more safely too!] – such as peeing. When he gets to seriously addressing the question, he says, “To get an idea of what it might be like, lets turn to mushroom poisonings.” Specifically – the Amanita bisporigera. The several related species (from America and Europe) are called by the name destroying angel. These mushrooms contain amatoxin, which binds to an enzyme that is used to read information from DNA. “It hobbles the enzyme, effectively interrupting the process by which cells follow DNA’s instructions.” The amatoxin causes irreversible damage to whatever cells it collects in, in its case, the liver and kidney. There is a walking ghost phase of Amanita poisoning, where the person seems to get better – but their cells are accumulating irreversible and lethal damage. Munroe says this is probably similar to what might happen in the case of the absurd question being answered.Other examples of DNA damage he talks about are from radiation and chemotherapy.I was appropriately horrified by this piece, but I learned about a mushroom I’d never known of, that apparently can be found in the area I live in. SO I now know what it looks like, having searched it out. (Not that I eat wild mushrooms.)Most of the questions are not this disturbing, though they are equally absurd.How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?How much space does the physical internet take up?If you call a random phone number and say “God bless you,” what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed?The book is like a box of assorted chocolates. You can never tell what you’ll find inside one. It might be scary, it might be funny; it might be just plain fascinating, you might learn something really strange. You very well might want to read parts of it to your partner (share the candy). Any or all, as well as other flavors not mentioned.But the best thing about this book is to just leave it around. Pick it up and flip to a page when you have guests. Or pick it up when you have nothing better to do, and eat one of the candies again!

All the nerd girls want to sleep with him and all nerd boys want to sleep with him too...be him.So it seems like he has been running a column on his website where people suggest extreme scientific hypotheticals and he tries to make sense of them and work out what would happen using his extreme knowledge of math and physics. I obviously have not been to observant because this book is the first I have heard of it. I guess I'm a bit of a shit fan. Hang on, I payed him for the book. Best fan ever.The book is a collection of questions he has answered as well as questions he did not answer for the good of society as a whole. Answered questions include ""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?"" and ""How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?"". These are the questions that I always ask while out in the world but I tend to forget as soon as I'm home. Or out of the shower. Definitely shower thoughts.Questions not answered include ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?"" and ""How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the belly button by a cheese cutting wire?"" It's fun to laugh along with these, but it does make you realise that there is a fine line between scientist and horribly obscene psycho killers. Mad scientists are common in literature while Mad Florists not so much. So this is the book for those readers who are tired of the science question and answer compendiums full of ""Why is the sky blue?"". I adored it and I want more. "
76,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,4,"I don't think I've ever laughed this much and hard from a science or non-fiction book-wait, I take that back, I haven't laughed this much from a book period. I mean periodic tables and radioactive decay doesn't normally warrant laughter-well at least when I read about it. The questions being presented is stuff that would have never crossed my mind, but the instant I read them I was like -oh wow-what the funk if that really happened? I loved the illustrations throughout- and how the scientific info was made into such a fun, yet informative read. For sure checking out more stuff by Munroe."
77,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionWhat if is a non-fiction book that -as the name implies- gives answer to some absurd hypothetical questions. The book was fun to read until at some points it wasn’t. The author is apparently a genius, I don’t know how can he think in that way. And the dedication and time that he puts to answer these questions is amazing.I imagine the author as that student who used to sit at the front seat and answer all the questions enthusiastically.My problem was that not all the questions were simple and even if they were or if he answered them simply, he would go and make it more and more complicated until I lost interest. Still an entertaining book, specially for the science nerds!"

Well, kind of. A long time ago, I bought a Kindle Fire. If you have bought a kindle Fire, then you know that Amazon fills the box with little 'tutorials'. *cough* ads in a pretty package*cough* Anyway, What If was on the pamphlet of books to read. It looked at it and thought interesting. I later read a book called 'Know it all', a book that asked and answered scientific questions. I loved it and wanted more. So I got this. It is sooo fascinating. It is full of questions that are logical yet so hard to answer. It had so many things I had been wondering myself! This is most certainly going on my Favorite shelf!| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram"
79,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"This book was equal parts hilarious and utter nightmare fuel. I have never had such an emotionally confusing reading experience. One second, snorting my drink up my nose from laughter, the next trying to shove down the sudden and complete terror I'm experiencing because I've been forced to imagine trying to survive in six atmospheres of pressure brought upon by an expanding Earth, or collapsing into a pile of human goo because I've lost my DNA, and doing so has reminded me of my mortality and oh there goes a panic attack WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE OF LIGHTNING AND RADIATION POISONING AND THEN GET EATEN BY CATS. Unlikely potential experiences, to be sure, but that's why you don't give someone like me a book like this. Unlikely experiences are just as easy to imagine and fear irrationally and without control as likely ones, and they only stimulate the bad parts of my imagination. I am now more afraid of a global windstorm brought on by the cessation of the Earth's rotation potentially killing all life on Earth than I am of being murdered or getting a fatal disease.All that is to say, I am most likely not this book's target audience, being a completely ridiculous ball of anxiety over things that nearly 100% will never, ever, ever happen. (I have been reading XKCD since college, though. It is a constant fixture in my life, and is not terrifying.)As a result, it's hard to quantify my experience with this book. So let's add up the points:+5 stars for being so smart and clever and creative-5 stars for answering all the questions where we all die and/or the Earth is destroyed+1 star for including the weird and worrying questions from the inbox that he refused to answer--we should know our limits, people-1 star for being entirely too preoccupied with questions that involve danger+1 star for my favorite question in the book, the one about calling random people on the telephone and saying ""God Bless You,"" hoping to get someone who's just sneezed-1 star for not having more ridiculous questions like that instead of ones where all your blood is drawn out of your finger by a ridiculously high density bullet, forming a giant blood bubble around said bullet and killing you-1000 stars for me waiting the entire fucking book for the question involving the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlacc pit. This question does not exist. I have been lied to.+999 stars for the extremely obscure Kyp Durron reference that only 1 out of every 100,000 people will get (or some other number that hasn't been pulled out of my ass)+1 star for every other Star Wars reference, all of which were clever and relevant+1 star for the funny illustrations+1 star for the recurring joke about the Netherlands (and the way he incorporates things like that into all his answers)-1 star for not including in the Human Computer chapter the obvious potential scenario that the little girl was trying to lasso the cat, and the vase was knocked over in the confusion +1 star for SCIENCE!!-1 star for MATH :(+1 stars for ending the book on a happy note, ""Sometimes it's nice not to destroy the world for a change.""+1 star because the stars I ended up with didn't seem like enoughYou can do the math for yourselves. Or, you know, look up at my star rating there."
80,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori,5,This is a lot of fun from a guy who likes when things catch fire. A lot of the questions reminded me of the ones Neil Gaiman fielded after Geoff Coffey's tweet that he would donate $1 to @EFF for every person who asks @neilhimself how they can watch American Gods in their country.
81,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Randall Munroe is a dangerous guy. Seriously dangerous. He is the author of the online comic strip xkcd. It's about math, science, hacking, logic, and a host of wonderfully nerdy subjects. But in this book, Munroe answers a stack of absurd hypothetical questions. Some of the questions are really crazy, like ""What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?"" Munroe explains that the ""thud"" as everyone came down at the same time wouldn't amount to much. But, the aftermath would be catastrophic.But what's really crazy, is how Munroe takes bland questions and hypes them into incredible zingers. For example, ""If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?"" The answer, of course, is ""no"". But Munroe never stops with an answer like that. He ups the ante, increasing the power of the laser pointers, to the point where he becomes really dangerous!What is truly wonderful about this book, is that the answers are explained with scientific reasoning. Occasionally the answers are speculative, but this is clearly spelled out. Munroe usually applies scientific principles to answer the questions correctly, regardless of the level of absurdity. And, the questions and answers are all illustrated with his stick-figure cartoons, adding appreciably to the humor."
82,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"Q. What if _____?A. Nearly Everyone Would Die!- Randall Munroe, What If? There are certain things on this planet that you seemed to do fine without, but as soon as you discover, you can't now do without. Diet Dr. Pepper, David Foster Wallace, dark chocolate covered cherries all fit into this category. So, too, does Randall Munroe. He seems to occupy a space near, but not on, that vacated by Gary Larson when the great Gary Larson stopped drawing the Far Side (January 1, 1995). If you are unimpressed by Gary Larsen or the Far Side or do not know who he is or what I'm talking about, hell man, read no further. This book is not for you. I'm not trying to suggest that Gary Larson and Randall Munroe occupy the same ground. They are very different. Their approach to science is different. Their technique. However, the Venn Diagram of those readers of Gary Larson 20+ years ago would closely resemble those readers of Randall Munroe's xkcd. Nerds. They are both worshiped by nerds. They are nerd gods. In this godhead of scientific nerd entertainers also exists Bill Nye. Anyway, these are binary science artists. You either get them and love them or you don't. If you don't, well congrats, I really hope someday you will recognized what you did to our beautiful world by voting for Trump. Bastard. Anyway, this book. This book is filled with drawings and explanations by Randall Munroe on topics as diverse as:""Q. What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?""""Q. What would happen if you were to gather a mole (unit of measurement) of moles (the small furry critter) in one place?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How high can a human throw something?""Here is the magic of this book, and why it is relevant and important. It is the essentials of science. Science is always jumping into absurd places asking weird questions. Monroe capture the joy of this experience and he integrates the reader into it. He is a translator (like most scientists are) of complex methods into a narrative of explanation. He just takes several absurd, but still logical steps further. I find his book about one standard deviation better than similar attempts at similar things. I'm thinking of Leyner's books: Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour. Both are using humor and science and the strategy of funky questions. There are a couple differences, that matter. Mark Leyner isn't a scientist. He's a soft postmodernist author that is playing doctor explaining awkward questons. Monroe is a scientist that is using the scientific method and humor to explain absurd, and sometimes practically nonsense questions. While both of these books can be considered humor books, I tend to favor the one written by a scientist who can draw (kinda) dinosaurs and a pyramid of giraffes. Personal preference I guess. Anyway, if you or anyone in your family is a nerd, or raising a nerd, and enjoy absurdity and funky questions, well, this is almost a perfect book. If not, go ahead and try and to convince me that your vote for Trump isn't going to be considered the beginning of the end of our civilization. You have no soul. "
83,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Update: He published a lot more that aren't in this book. Read them for free here:http://what-if.xkcd.com/archive/So... I love xkcd & some of these questions were really interesting - funny on the face with some really interesting science & math backing up the answer. For instance, the bullet being hit by lightning got into quite a few interesting facts about lightning. Who wouldn't want to know if a machine gun jet pack would work including discussions on caliber, barrel burn out, & fire rates? Cooking a steak via a high altitude drop wasn't nearly as crazy as a mole of moles, but they would make an interesting planetoid. I never would have thought of that on my own. This isn't a book to just sit down & read. The questions & answers often require contemplation. Yoda powered houses probably won't catch on, but discovering just what his maximum power output was when he picked Luke's X-wing out of the swamp got into equations about power & how many Yodas it would take to power our civilization. Sure, I learned them in 9th grade physics, but the refresher was a whole lot more interesting than Ms. Hummel's class ever was. (Sorry, Ms. Hummel. Your class was interesting & figuring out horsepower by running up a flight of stairs was great, but... well... Yoda. Yes, I know your class was long before even the first Star Wars movie, but... Yoda-power. How green can you get?)And then there are the Weird & Worrying Questions sections that dotted this odd amalgamation. Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee? is fairly horrifying, but whatever turns you on. Is it possible to cry so much you dehydrate yourself? is sad, but they're still pure entertainment for me. If I were Munroe & had to worry about the people sending those emails, I might well disconnect from society & move to the middle of northern Alberta, Canada. You think I exaggerate? How many houses are burned down in the United States every year? What would be the easiest way to increase that number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)? How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Eeek! There are some scary people out there!Highly recommended in small doses!"

But to my dismay, I don't think that he fully appreciated the genius of it, but well... some people are colorblind. Life is sometimes cruel like that. Anyway, this book was great. I've been a fan of XKCD for a long time now, and even if this book was crap, I'd have happily purchased a copy just to support Randall Munroe for my previous webcomic enjoyment. But this book was not crap. It was great. Interesting question content, well-thought out and researched answers, just the right mixture of humor to balance out the brain 'splody math stuff... I loved it. I'm going to give this book three awards: First, for best comedic use of [citation needed]. Second, for best usage of footnote text EVAR.

What If?, or Serendipity; or the Literary/Pop Culture Quotes Quiz
Late at night, about a week ago, I went through the Top Quotes pages of Goodreads. A hundred pages, each with thirty quotes: that's 3000 quotes. I have problems. I was searching for quotes that included (on the most part, primarily consisted of) a line in the form of 'If A, B' (let's call it an If quote, or IQ) - I'd compiled them because I had a certain idea for a review where I would use them.What's the catch? The idea was for the review of another book - not What If?. But the day after the nighttime scavenging, I decided against using it because my sense of reviewing aesthetics decided to go with another idea. The result was that I had all these IQ's sitting in a file on my desktop, but they were left completely untouched because I didn't plan to use them any more, while regretting how I should have thought about it more before compiling them in the first place.Fast forward a week, and today I finished Munroe's book. I hadn't really thought about reviewing it (immediately, anyway), but tonight I glanced at the book the review of which the IQ's were meant for on my desk, and it hit me.What If? questions. If... quotes. So I'm able to use my dear IQ's for a review after all. Ladies and gentlemen, that's serendipity for you.From the 3000 quotes, there were a surprising amount of IQ's. I'd estimate there were 60 or so quotes including an If... line (citation needed), of which I had copied 45 of into my file for their quality and validity of use in my review for that other book. I'd like to make it 50 for a nicer number but no artificial perfectionism here - science needs integrity.Here's how the IQ's fit into this review:1. I give you the first half of each IQ (the If A).2. You'll also be given the author of the quote.3. Your task is to see how many of the B's you can fill out. The answers are hidden under the spoiler tags. Better leave peeking at the answer for after you've answered a series by the same author since they might be a giveaway.4. Write your test score /45 in the comments section (give me some love, joy and social validation). For the answers, if they are relatively close you can give yourself the mark.5.

Update:
 This is my first experience in reading a book in paper-copy and having it actually change how much I enjoyed it. A friend who knows me all too well gave me the hardcover version of What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions as a birthday present- and reading it as an ebook just didn't do it justice. The laugh-factor jumped by several orders of magnitude! So here's to Randal Munroe, XKCD and keeping physical books alive!The brain behind 

xkcd

, 

Randall Munroe

, has been churning out even more than his nerdy and hilarious stick-figure comics. This wunderkind also answers to imaginative queries submitted by us lay-folk in 

What if?

, a sort of xkcd sub-blog. So, yes, this is a book-ified blog, which isn't always a bad thing. I actually hadn't really followed the blog prior to reading the book, and was surprised by the balance Munroe is able to strike to make his answers both “scientific” and accessible. Any curious kid could enjoy the book, and the same goes for adults (though if you're hoping for rigorous calculations you will be disappointed).  The weird thing about hypothetical questions, though, is that depending on your audience, sometimes the answer you'll get is ‘Who cares?’ And, for whatever reason, my interest arbitrarily waxed and waned. For example: - Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward firing machine guns? Fascinating! Do tell...

- What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power was turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1 meter box? Better question: Why would you ever want to know that?

I found easily three-quarters of the questions interesting, so I won't dock serious points for that, and that wouldn't be problematic if I were more of a browser-type reader.  Of course, extra love added for a veritable rolling mental montage of 
Archer
 tie-ins. The 
Weightless Arrow
 question (something to the effect of: would the friction of air eventually stop an arrow in a zero-gravity environment?) could be easily answered by my favorite world's greatest secret agent.

And... y'know... taunt people on the internet. And it worked. I got an early copy. And I treasured it. I petted it. It was precious to me. Precious. Then life got in the way. Conventions. Promotion for my own book launch. I had dad stuff to do. I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser. Then I had my book tour.... Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did. "
92,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?"

  Trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.
Randall Munroe, ex-NASA employee and author of the wildly popular webcomic XKCD, decides to look at several, undoubtedly, absurd questions and find scientific answers to them.Nothing is too absurd for him - whether it be the logistics of finding your soulmate to what happens if our moon suddenly disappears - Munroe answers it all.
But I’ve never seen the Icarus story as a lesson about the limitations of humans. I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.
I absolutely loved the tone of voice throughout the book. 
There’s no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word “NO” scrawled over and over in charred blood.
His hilarious deadpan just absolutely cinched this book for me. 
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.

Honestly, teachers need to stop the whole calculate-the-gravity-of-a-falling-ball shtick and jump on the calculate-the-force-of-wind-turbines-powered-by-people-at-a-gym bandwagon. Seriously, just make learning fun and the rest will go from there.In short - yes!

Dear Mr. Munroe, please consider this a standing invitation.When I was five, I was trying to figure out how difficult it would be to reach the Moon if I were to stack chairs on top of each other (for a head start, beginning this enterprise from the roof of a 9-story building). I was sure about a 1000 would do. I should have just contacted Randall Munroe.
 “DISCLAIMER: Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind.”
This book will provide you with detailed physics and mathematics solutions to a plethora of …ahem… interesting questions. I picked a few just to convey to you how deep the sheer awesomeness of ‘What If’ goes.——————————————————————
 “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?”
Munroe approaches this very important question with scientific rigor. After consulting literature on the steak drag coefficient, US military studies from the Cold War era, “research papers on the heating of ICBM nose cones as they reenter the atmosphere” and a cookbook (duh!), making an assumption that “Steaks can probably survive breaking the sound barrier”, and after making amazing graphs such as the one below …

 … he finally comes to the obvious conclusion that “we should drop the steak over Pittsburgh” (because of the tradition of “Pittsburgh rare” steaks there), and our elegant answer is:
 “So drop your steak from a suborbital rocket, send out a collection team to recover it, brush it off, reheat it, cut away any badly charred sections, and dig in.Just watch out for salmonella. And the Andromeda Strain.”
—————————————
 “How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?”
Some simple models clearly give you the only plausible answer: Netherlands will become a supraplanetary entity. To see how, you need to read for yourself.


“Supposing you did drain the oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?”
Again, the answer is clear — it’s a future that will be Netherlands-shaped:
—————————————
“What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?”
Brief answer: “NEARLY EVERYONE WOULD DIE. Then things would get interesting.”—————————————
 “What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?”
Answer: “Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.”
—————————————
 “How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?”

“Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90 percent of the speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.”———————————
 “How much Force power can Yoda output?”
“I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.”
After a fair share of assumptions and equations, it’s blatantly obvious that Yoda is a much better power source than Luke Skywalker. But a word of caution before we change our power grid to Yoda-based: “So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would definitely be green.”5 stars. If I’m ever shipwrecked on a remote island, I hope to have this book with me — maybe somewhere in its depths there’s a calculation of how long I can last before resorting to cannibalism."
97,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seen:""Do not try any of this at home.

The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting, directly or indirectly, from information contained in this book.""That disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science: Dangerous ideas ahead, folks! Don't get too close -- these things could kill ya!Randall Munroe used to work at NASA, and now he creates the webcomic XKCD (which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig). On his website, he takes ""absurd hypothetical questions"" from readers and tries to answer some of them. Here are some of my favorite questions in this book:What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?Which US state is actually flown over the most?Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?How high can a human throw something?How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?When, if ever, will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?How many Lego bricks would it take to build a bridge capable of carrying traffic from London to New York? Have that many Lego bricks been manufactured?What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?If you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions, this book is for you! What made this so much fun, aside from the ridiculous questions, is Munroe's sense of humor. Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers, which is not something that usually happens when I'm reading about science. Oh, and be sure to read his footnotes, which have even more jokes.I think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works. I think I would have loved it when I was 10. *I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book, because I had never heard of the author before. It's the miracle of Goodreads! "
98,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"Mr Munroe includes some “weird and worrying” questions from his website’s inbox which he presents without attempting to answer – one favourite was:If you saved a whole life’s worth of kissing and used all that suction power on one single kiss, how much suction force would that single kiss have?I guess the answer might be “what pharmaceutical products have you ingested during the last four hours?” or “May I speak to your parents?”Another person named Jon Merrill askedHow fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Answer has to be “as fast as I will be running if I ever meet you Jon”.And a person called Kenneth askedWhat if every day, every human had a 1 per cent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a one percent chance of being turned into a human?  Randall does not provide a response to that one but I would have said Kenneth, if only life were like that. Wouldn’t it be fabulous?Everybody likes this book and I liked half of it, the other half was so far over my head it might have been a distant Andean condor croaking Sanskrit into a Bluetooth headset. Some of the stuff Randall devotes pages of detailed analysis to did not tickle my ivories, likeWhat would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put into an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? I mean, get a life. Who the flook cares about a hair dryer in a box? But many are very interesting. He tackles the old chestnutWhat would happen of everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same time?  He picks Rhode Island (it’s just big enough for everyone on Earth, surprisingly) as a designated place where this event might be staged, and imagines the result. In regard to the jump and the landing itself, not so much would result. But then he imagines the implications of all those people trying to get back home from Rhode Island. It’s terrible – it’s an apocalypse. If this mass jumping event was actually staged it would cause the immediate termination of civilisation and the death of billions. The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Yes it is a nice book but I do not recommend that you wolf down this book as I did in 2 days, because it’s like TOO MUCH and it can get annoying. You keep thinking of your own absurd questions – How many soldier ants would it take to chew through my leg in one hour? And would I survive? And really, there is one question which I really want to ask Randall, it’s actually been something I have been wondering about for a long time – you know those vending machines stuffed full of really unhealthy chocs and crisps and cokes? Well, imagine a person was chained to one of those and had an infinite amount of small change within arms reach. Then imagine the vending machine gets refilled by the usual contractor in the usual way (who never notices the chained person). So : how long would it take the captive to die from a constant diet of crap? If they were only eating chocs and crisps and drinking cokes? A month? Six months? A YEAR?? It’s really bugging me. I may have to launch a practical experiment. "

But hey, why the heck not? Right? XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famous.The book comes from his ""what if"" blog, which is also very good.I took the book into work with me to show it around - you know - hipster-esque and what not. I'm reading this trendy, new book first.But the guys at my table were all like, ""Yeah... I can see myself reading like 2 or 3 of these and then putting the book down..."" Everyone more or less nodded in agreement - even though they thought the book was cool.Then I looked at the book a little bit more closely, flipped through a little bit and thought, ""Huh... that sounds about right. That's probably what I'm going to do...""I'll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions... This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly. You know: ""But what if Hitler hadn't killed the Jews? Would you like him then?"" or ""What if Martin Luther King Jr. had used violence? You have to admit, it's pretty crazy that we've given this guy a holiday, right?"" He has a point.So, I took the book home - slightly shamed that I hadn't realized it was more for coffee tables than actual reading.But then I picked it up and read a couple. And a couple more. Next thing I know, a couple of days later the book is done - and I really enjoyed it. ...And I learned a lot. Well presumably.I did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroe's math. Or any of his conclusions. I mean, if I did on a couple of these, there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right? If I could take issue with a couple... I am NOT a math guy.In case there aren't any flame wars yet, let me start one: On page 114 in answer to the question, ""If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?"" he says, ""The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit. These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses. After a few days, your immune system notices and destroys it, but not before you infect, on average, one other person."" Then he has a footnote which reads, ""Mathematically, this must be true. If the average were less than one, the virus would die out. If it were more than one, eventually everyone would have a cold all the time. But that can't be right? Can it? It's tough to tell whether he's serious or not, because sometimes the footnotes are jokes, and other times they're not.But here, it made me question the math of the rest of the book. He's very meticulous in his calculations throughout, but here he doesn't factor in seasons, or how vast the globe is... Wouldn't it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection - and then people stay away from us - and are more cautious in general - which is why the number goes back down but doesn't die out completely?It took me a while to get over this, undermining the whole book for a couple seconds. Seriously, if he had just said ""but not before you infect, on average, on other person."" I wouldn't have thought twice about it.Of course, I doubted him on other footnotes: pg 134 ""Although it'sa little different, if you drip superglue on cotton thread, it will catch fire."" That can't be right can it? That's another of his jokes? Right?Munroe also interspersed ""Weird (and worrying) questions from the what if? inbox. ...Honestly, most of these weren't any weirder than the questions he was already answering. And sometimes I think they only seemed weird, but I think he may have missed the trail.Like on page 236, the question is, ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?""There's a stick figure that says ...""Asking for a friend... former friend, I mean.""But I think it's a legitimate question. And I'm pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM. - wasn't it a major plot point? So, Thomas, (the person who asked the question) wherever you are - I don't think you're a weirdo. (...Yeah, yeah, yeah... spoiler alert, if you're reading this in 1996... Although, I'd be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time, it's Munroe. He's sure studying that stuff. And Einstein. And Schrodinger. Also, probably J. Robert Oppenheimer.) And the book is so dated. He mentions the ""new-fangled writing section"" of the SAT on page 278. That was dropped way back in 2016. - Time travelling - am I right?Finally, Munroe - if you're reading this - and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already. You may hate it, but don't knock it till you've tried it, right?Seriously - loved the book. Thought I would like it, didn't think I would love it. Didn't think I would read it the whole way through - finished it in under 3 days....Also, shouldn't this go under like... a sci-fi shelf? Since the questions are hypothetical... Isn't this exactly what science-fiction is? It's just not told in narrative form in this case?"

At any rate, let’s see …Random time in the interval 45 minutes to 75 minutes: 53:51I’d better turn off the baseball game. Right.Okay, the clock is started,Author Randall Munroe writes the on-line comic strip xkcd. (See example above.)https://xkcd.com/On the site, it’s billed as A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. There’s a lot of casual references to computer stuff too. Munroe used to work at NASA as a physicist (I think), then decided to do this other gig. The gags he draws range from single frame, to three frames, to multiple frames extended down your computer screen – sometimes with rafts of text in table form, or anything else that he thinks appropriate for the laugh he’s aiming at.A couple hints for looking at xkcd.1) The humans are always drawn as stick figures. Their gender is shown by types of hairdos on the females. In the strip above, the sociologist, chemist, and mathematician are girls. Obviously.2) By hovering your mouse over the picture (not clicking) a “bonus punch line” (my phrase) will appear. (That won't happen with the cartoon above.)44:03the bookThe secondary title is SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.There might be about 60 of the Question/ANSWER articles in the book. (No time to count them.) Interspersed with these are a dozen single page pieces called “Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox”. Each page has a couple questions, with no response by the author, except for sometimes a cartoon drawing, a stick figure saying something. etc.Here’s a quite worrying example, #6Q. What is the total nutritional value (calories, fat, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the average human body? – Justin RisnerQ. What temperature would a chainsaw (or other cutting implement) need to be at to instantly cauterize any injuries inflicted with it? – Sylvia Gallaher(These are probably the worst in the book.) One of these that I wished he had answered was this one.Q. What if every day, every human had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a human? - KennethThe main entries are 3-5 pages long, mostly text, some cartoons accompanying. It’s often hard to anticipate where Munroe will go with a question.One item is called No More DNA. The question is, “This may be a bit gruesome, but … if someone’s DNA suddenly vanished, how long would that person last?”Munroe notes that the average person would be about a third of a pound lighter, then gives a list of several ways that one can lose that amount of weight easier [more safely too!] – such as peeing. When he gets to seriously addressing the question, he says, “To get an idea of what it might be like, lets turn to mushroom poisonings.” Specifically – the Amanita bisporigera. The several related species (from America and Europe) are called by the name destroying angel. These mushrooms contain amatoxin, which binds to an enzyme that is used to read information from DNA. “It hobbles the enzyme, effectively interrupting the process by which cells follow DNA’s instructions.” The amatoxin causes irreversible damage to whatever cells it collects in, in its case, the liver and kidney. There is a walking ghost phase of Amanita poisoning, where the person seems to get better – but their cells are accumulating irreversible and lethal damage. Munroe says this is probably similar to what might happen in the case of the absurd question being answered.Other examples of DNA damage he talks about are from radiation and chemotherapy.I was appropriately horrified by this piece, but I learned about a mushroom I’d never known of, that apparently can be found in the area I live in. SO I now know what it looks like, having searched it out. (Not that I eat wild mushrooms.)Most of the questions are not this disturbing, though they are equally absurd.How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?How much space does the physical internet take up?If you call a random phone number and say “God bless you,” what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed?The book is like a box of assorted chocolates. You can never tell what you’ll find inside one. It might be scary, it might be funny; it might be just plain fascinating, you might learn something really strange. You very well might want to read parts of it to your partner (share the candy). Any or all, as well as other flavors not mentioned.But the best thing about this book is to just leave it around. Pick it up and flip to a page when you have guests. Or pick it up when you have nothing better to do, and eat one of the candies again!

Best fan ever.The book is a collection of questions he has answered as well as questions he did not answer for the good of society as a whole. Answered questions include ""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?"" and ""How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?"". These are the questions that I always ask while out in the world but I tend to forget as soon as I'm home. Or out of the shower. Definitely shower thoughts.Questions not answered include ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?"" and ""How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the belly button by a cheese cutting wire?"" It's fun to laugh along with these, but it does make you realise that there is a fine line between scientist and horribly obscene psycho killers. Mad scientists are common in literature while Mad Florists not so much. So this is the book for those readers who are tired of the science question and answer compendiums full of ""Why is the sky blue?"". I adored it and I want more. "

I mean periodic tables and radioactive decay doesn't normally warrant laughter-well at least when I read about it. The questions being presented is stuff that would have never crossed my mind, but the instant I read them I was like -oh wow-what the funk if that really happened? I loved the illustrations throughout- and how the scientific info was made into such a fun, yet informative read. For sure checking out more stuff by Munroe."
107,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionWhat if is a non-fiction book that -as the name implies- gives answer to some absurd hypothetical questions. The book was fun to read until at some points it wasn’t. The author is apparently a genius, I don’t know how can he think in that way. And the dedication and time that he puts to answer these questions is amazing.I imagine the author as that student who used to sit at the front seat and answer all the questions enthusiastically.My problem was that not all the questions were simple and even if they were or if he answered them simply, he would go and make it more and more complicated until I lost interest. Still an entertaining book, specially for the science nerds!"
108,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70951605-tucker-tuckerthereader,5,"Two years after reading this for the first time, I now own two copies and re-read it monthly. ******It started with a Kindle! Well, kind of. A long time ago, I bought a Kindle Fire. If you have bought a kindle Fire, then you know that Amazon fills the box with little 'tutorials'. *cough* ads in a pretty package*cough* Anyway, What If was on the pamphlet of books to read. It looked at it and thought interesting. I later read a book called 'Know it all', a book that asked and answered scientific questions. I loved it and wanted more. So I got this. It is sooo fascinating. It is full of questions that are logical yet so hard to answer. It had so many things I had been wondering myself! This is most certainly going on my Favorite shelf!| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram"
109,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"This book was equal parts hilarious and utter nightmare fuel. I have never had such an emotionally confusing reading experience. One second, snorting my drink up my nose from laughter, the next trying to shove down the sudden and complete terror I'm experiencing because I've been forced to imagine trying to survive in six atmospheres of pressure brought upon by an expanding Earth, or collapsing into a pile of human goo because I've lost my DNA, and doing so has reminded me of my mortality and oh there goes a panic attack WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE OF LIGHTNING AND RADIATION POISONING AND THEN GET EATEN BY CATS. Unlikely potential experiences, to be sure, but that's why you don't give someone like me a book like this. Unlikely experiences are just as easy to imagine and fear irrationally and without control as likely ones, and they only stimulate the bad parts of my imagination. I am now more afraid of a global windstorm brought on by the cessation of the Earth's rotation potentially killing all life on Earth than I am of being murdered or getting a fatal disease.All that is to say, I am most likely not this book's target audience, being a completely ridiculous ball of anxiety over things that nearly 100% will never, ever, ever happen. (I have been reading XKCD since college, though. It is a constant fixture in my life, and is not terrifying.)As a result, it's hard to quantify my experience with this book. So let's add up the points:+5 stars for being so smart and clever and creative-5 stars for answering all the questions where we all die and/or the Earth is destroyed+1 star for including the weird and worrying questions from the inbox that he refused to answer--we should know our limits, people-1 star for being entirely too preoccupied with questions that involve danger+1 star for my favorite question in the book, the one about calling random people on the telephone and saying ""God Bless You,"" hoping to get someone who's just sneezed-1 star for not having more ridiculous questions like that instead of ones where all your blood is drawn out of your finger by a ridiculously high density bullet, forming a giant blood bubble around said bullet and killing you-1000 stars for me waiting the entire fucking book for the question involving the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlacc pit. This question does not exist. I have been lied to.+999 stars for the extremely obscure Kyp Durron reference that only 1 out of every 100,000 people will get (or some other number that hasn't been pulled out of my ass)+1 star for every other Star Wars reference, all of which were clever and relevant+1 star for the funny illustrations+1 star for the recurring joke about the Netherlands (and the way he incorporates things like that into all his answers)-1 star for not including in the Human Computer chapter the obvious potential scenario that the little girl was trying to lasso the cat, and the vase was knocked over in the confusion +1 star for SCIENCE!!-1 star for MATH :(+1 stars for ending the book on a happy note, ""Sometimes it's nice not to destroy the world for a change.""+1 star because the stars I ended up with didn't seem like enoughYou can do the math for yourselves. Or, you know, look up at my star rating there."

A lot of the questions reminded me of the ones Neil Gaiman fielded after Geoff Coffey's tweet that he would donate $1 to @EFF for every person who asks @neilhimself how they can watch American Gods in their country.
111,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Randall Munroe is a dangerous guy. Seriously dangerous. He is the author of the online comic strip xkcd. It's about math, science, hacking, logic, and a host of wonderfully nerdy subjects. But in this book, Munroe answers a stack of absurd hypothetical questions. Some of the questions are really crazy, like ""What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?"" Munroe explains that the ""thud"" as everyone came down at the same time wouldn't amount to much. But, the aftermath would be catastrophic.But what's really crazy, is how Munroe takes bland questions and hypes them into incredible zingers. For example, ""If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?"" The answer, of course, is ""no"". But Munroe never stops with an answer like that. He ups the ante, increasing the power of the laser pointers, to the point where he becomes really dangerous!What is truly wonderful about this book, is that the answers are explained with scientific reasoning. Occasionally the answers are speculative, but this is clearly spelled out. Munroe usually applies scientific principles to answer the questions correctly, regardless of the level of absurdity. And, the questions and answers are all illustrated with his stick-figure cartoons, adding appreciably to the humor."
112,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"Q. What if _____?A. Nearly Everyone Would Die!- Randall Munroe, What If? There are certain things on this planet that you seemed to do fine without, but as soon as you discover, you can't now do without. Diet Dr. Pepper, David Foster Wallace, dark chocolate covered cherries all fit into this category. So, too, does Randall Munroe. He seems to occupy a space near, but not on, that vacated by Gary Larson when the great Gary Larson stopped drawing the Far Side (January 1, 1995). If you are unimpressed by Gary Larsen or the Far Side or do not know who he is or what I'm talking about, hell man, read no further. This book is not for you. I'm not trying to suggest that Gary Larson and Randall Munroe occupy the same ground. They are very different. Their approach to science is different. Their technique. However, the Venn Diagram of those readers of Gary Larson 20+ years ago would closely resemble those readers of Randall Munroe's xkcd. Nerds. They are both worshiped by nerds. They are nerd gods. In this godhead of scientific nerd entertainers also exists Bill Nye. Anyway, these are binary science artists. You either get them and love them or you don't. If you don't, well congrats, I really hope someday you will recognized what you did to our beautiful world by voting for Trump. Bastard. Anyway, this book. This book is filled with drawings and explanations by Randall Munroe on topics as diverse as:""Q. What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?""""Q. What would happen if you were to gather a mole (unit of measurement) of moles (the small furry critter) in one place?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How high can a human throw something?""Here is the magic of this book, and why it is relevant and important. It is the essentials of science. Science is always jumping into absurd places asking weird questions. Monroe capture the joy of this experience and he integrates the reader into it. He is a translator (like most scientists are) of complex methods into a narrative of explanation. He just takes several absurd, but still logical steps further. I find his book about one standard deviation better than similar attempts at similar things. I'm thinking of Leyner's books: Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour. Both are using humor and science and the strategy of funky questions. There are a couple differences, that matter. Mark Leyner isn't a scientist. He's a soft postmodernist author that is playing doctor explaining awkward questons. Monroe is a scientist that is using the scientific method and humor to explain absurd, and sometimes practically nonsense questions. While both of these books can be considered humor books, I tend to favor the one written by a scientist who can draw (kinda) dinosaurs and a pyramid of giraffes. Personal preference I guess. Anyway, if you or anyone in your family is a nerd, or raising a nerd, and enjoy absurdity and funky questions, well, this is almost a perfect book. If not, go ahead and try and to convince me that your vote for Trump isn't going to be considered the beginning of the end of our civilization. You have no soul. "
113,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Update: He published a lot more that aren't in this book. Read them for free here:http://what-if.xkcd.com/archive/So... I love xkcd & some of these questions were really interesting - funny on the face with some really interesting science & math backing up the answer. For instance, the bullet being hit by lightning got into quite a few interesting facts about lightning. Who wouldn't want to know if a machine gun jet pack would work including discussions on caliber, barrel burn out, & fire rates? Cooking a steak via a high altitude drop wasn't nearly as crazy as a mole of moles, but they would make an interesting planetoid. I never would have thought of that on my own. This isn't a book to just sit down & read. The questions & answers often require contemplation. Yoda powered houses probably won't catch on, but discovering just what his maximum power output was when he picked Luke's X-wing out of the swamp got into equations about power & how many Yodas it would take to power our civilization. Sure, I learned them in 9th grade physics, but the refresher was a whole lot more interesting than Ms. Hummel's class ever was. (Sorry, Ms. Hummel. Your class was interesting & figuring out horsepower by running up a flight of stairs was great, but... well... Yoda. Yes, I know your class was long before even the first Star Wars movie, but... Yoda-power. How green can you get?)And then there are the Weird & Worrying Questions sections that dotted this odd amalgamation. Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee? is fairly horrifying, but whatever turns you on. Is it possible to cry so much you dehydrate yourself? is sad, but they're still pure entertainment for me. If I were Munroe & had to worry about the people sending those emails, I might well disconnect from society & move to the middle of northern Alberta, Canada. You think I exaggerate? How many houses are burned down in the United States every year? What would be the easiest way to increase that number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)? How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Eeek! There are some scary people out there!Highly recommended in small doses!"

But to my dismay, I don't think that he fully appreciated the genius of it, but well... some people are colorblind. Life is sometimes cruel like that. Anyway, this book was great. I've been a fan of XKCD for a long time now, and even if this book was crap, I'd have happily purchased a copy just to support Randall Munroe for my previous webcomic enjoyment. But this book was not crap. It was great. Interesting question content, well-thought out and researched answers, just the right mixture of humor to balance out the brain 'splody math stuff... I loved it. I'm going to give this book three awards: First, for best comedic use of [citation needed]. Second, for best usage of footnote text EVAR. (Really, I couldn't imagine reading this in ebook format - the footnotes made me giggle so frequently that if they were a pain in the tushie to read on an ebook, so much greatness would be missed.)Finally, for best travelogue.

What If?, or Serendipity; or the Literary/Pop Culture Quotes Quiz
Late at night, about a week ago, I went through the Top Quotes pages of Goodreads. A hundred pages, each with thirty quotes: that's 3000 quotes. I have problems. I was searching for quotes that included (on the most part, primarily consisted of) a line in the form of 'If A, B' (let's call it an If quote, or IQ) - I'd compiled them because I had a certain idea for a review where I would use them.What's the catch? The idea was for the review of another book - not What If?. But the day after the nighttime scavenging, I decided against using it because my sense of reviewing aesthetics decided to go with another idea. The result was that I had all these IQ's sitting in a file on my desktop, but they were left completely untouched because I didn't plan to use them any more, while regretting how I should have thought about it more before compiling them in the first place.Fast forward a week, and today I finished Munroe's book. I hadn't really thought about reviewing it (immediately, anyway), but tonight I glanced at the book the review of which the IQ's were meant for on my desk, and it hit me.What If? questions. If... quotes. So I'm able to use my dear IQ's for a review after all. Ladies and gentlemen, that's serendipity for you.From the 3000 quotes, there were a surprising amount of IQ's. I'd estimate there were 60 or so quotes including an If... line (citation needed), of which I had copied 45 of into my file for their quality and validity of use in my review for that other book. I'd like to make it 50 for a nicer number but no artificial perfectionism here - science needs integrity.Here's how the IQ's fit into this review:1. I give you the first half of each IQ (the If A).2. You'll also be given the author of the quote.3. Your task is to see how many of the B's you can fill out. The answers are hidden under the spoiler tags. Better leave peeking at the answer for after you've answered a series by the same author since they might be a giveaway.4. Write your test score /45 in the comments section (give me some love, joy and social validation). For the answers, if they are relatively close you can give yourself the mark.5. Cheaters, if found, will be reported to the Internet Police.Got your pen and paper? Your writing time starts...now.1.

Update:
 This is my first experience in reading a book in paper-copy and having it actually change how much I enjoyed it. A friend who knows me all too well gave me the hardcover version of What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions as a birthday present- and reading it as an ebook just didn't do it justice. The laugh-factor jumped by several orders of magnitude! So here's to Randal Munroe, XKCD and keeping physical books alive!The brain behind 

xkcd

, 

Randall Munroe

, has been churning out even more than his nerdy and hilarious stick-figure comics. This wunderkind also answers to imaginative queries submitted by us lay-folk in 

What if?

, a sort of xkcd sub-blog. So, yes, this is a book-ified blog, which isn't always a bad thing. I actually hadn't really followed the blog prior to reading the book, and was surprised by the balance Munroe is able to strike to make his answers both “scientific” and accessible. Any curious kid could enjoy the book, and the same goes for adults (though if you're hoping for rigorous calculations you will be disappointed).  The weird thing about hypothetical questions, though, is that depending on your audience, sometimes the answer you'll get is ‘Who cares?’ And, for whatever reason, my interest arbitrarily waxed and waned. For example: - Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward firing machine guns? Fascinating! Do tell...

- What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power was turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1 meter box? Better question: Why would you ever want to know that?

I found easily three-quarters of the questions interesting, so I won't dock serious points for that, and that wouldn't be problematic if I were more of a browser-type reader.  Of course, extra love added for a veritable rolling mental montage of 
Archer
 tie-ins. The 
Weightless Arrow
 question (something to the effect of: would the friction of air eventually stop an arrow in a zero-gravity environment?) could be easily answered by my favorite world's greatest secret agent.

So much of a fan that when I heard about this book, I went so far as to abuse my power as an author to get an Advance Reading Copy of the book, so that I could enjoy its deliciousness sooner. And... y'know... taunt people on the internet. And it worked. I got an early copy. And I treasured it. I petted it. It was precious to me. Precious. Then life got in the way. Conventions. Promotion for my own book launch. I had dad stuff to do. I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser. Then I had my book tour.... Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did. "
122,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?"

  Trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.
Randall Munroe, ex-NASA employee and author of the wildly popular webcomic XKCD, decides to look at several, undoubtedly, absurd questions and find scientific answers to them.Nothing is too absurd for him - whether it be the logistics of finding your soulmate to what happens if our moon suddenly disappears - Munroe answers it all.
But I’ve never seen the Icarus story as a lesson about the limitations of humans. I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.
I absolutely loved the tone of voice throughout the book. 
There’s no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word “NO” scrawled over and over in charred blood.
His hilarious deadpan just absolutely cinched this book for me. 
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.

Honestly, teachers need to stop the whole calculate-the-gravity-of-a-falling-ball shtick and jump on the calculate-the-force-of-wind-turbines-powered-by-people-at-a-gym bandwagon. Seriously, just make learning fun and the rest will go from there.In short - yes!

Dear Mr. Munroe, please consider this a standing invitation.When I was five, I was trying to figure out how difficult it would be to reach the Moon if I were to stack chairs on top of each other (for a head start, beginning this enterprise from the roof of a 9-story building). I was sure about a 1000 would do. I should have just contacted Randall Munroe.
 “DISCLAIMER: Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind.”
This book will provide you with detailed physics and mathematics solutions to a plethora of …ahem… interesting questions. I picked a few just to convey to you how deep the sheer awesomeness of ‘What If’ goes.——————————————————————
 “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?”
Munroe approaches this very important question with scientific rigor. After consulting literature on the steak drag coefficient, US military studies from the Cold War era, “research papers on the heating of ICBM nose cones as they reenter the atmosphere” and a cookbook (duh!), making an assumption that “Steaks can probably survive breaking the sound barrier”, and after making amazing graphs such as the one below …

 … he finally comes to the obvious conclusion that “we should drop the steak over Pittsburgh” (because of the tradition of “Pittsburgh rare” steaks there), and our elegant answer is:
 “So drop your steak from a suborbital rocket, send out a collection team to recover it, brush it off, reheat it, cut away any badly charred sections, and dig in.Just watch out for salmonella. And the Andromeda Strain.”
—————————————
 “How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?”
Some simple models clearly give you the only plausible answer: Netherlands will become a supraplanetary entity. To see how, you need to read for yourself.


“Supposing you did drain the oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?”
Again, the answer is clear — it’s a future that will be Netherlands-shaped:
—————————————
“What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?”
Brief answer: “NEARLY EVERYONE WOULD DIE. Then things would get interesting.”—————————————
 “What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?”
Answer: “Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.”
—————————————
 “How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?”

“Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90 percent of the speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.”———————————
 “How much Force power can Yoda output?”
“I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.”
After a fair share of assumptions and equations, it’s blatantly obvious that Yoda is a much better power source than Luke Skywalker. But a word of caution before we change our power grid to Yoda-based: “So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would definitely be green.”5 stars. If I’m ever shipwrecked on a remote island, I hope to have this book with me — maybe somewhere in its depths there’s a calculation of how long I can last before resorting to cannibalism."
127,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seen:""Do not try any of this at home.

The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting, directly or indirectly, from information contained in this book.""That disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science: Dangerous ideas ahead, folks! Don't get too close -- these things could kill ya!Randall Munroe used to work at NASA, and now he creates the webcomic XKCD (which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig). On his website, he takes ""absurd hypothetical questions"" from readers and tries to answer some of them. Here are some of my favorite questions in this book:What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?Which US state is actually flown over the most?Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?How high can a human throw something?How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?When, if ever, will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?How many Lego bricks would it take to build a bridge capable of carrying traffic from London to New York? Have that many Lego bricks been manufactured?What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?If you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions, this book is for you! What made this so much fun, aside from the ridiculous questions, is Munroe's sense of humor. Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers, which is not something that usually happens when I'm reading about science. Oh, and be sure to read his footnotes, which have even more jokes.I think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works. I think I would have loved it when I was 10. *I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book, because I had never heard of the author before. It's the miracle of Goodreads! "
128,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"Mr Munroe includes some “weird and worrying” questions from his website’s inbox which he presents without attempting to answer – one favourite was:If you saved a whole life’s worth of kissing and used all that suction power on one single kiss, how much suction force would that single kiss have?I guess the answer might be “what pharmaceutical products have you ingested during the last four hours?” or “May I speak to your parents?”Another person named Jon Merrill askedHow fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Answer has to be “as fast as I will be running if I ever meet you Jon”.And a person called Kenneth askedWhat if every day, every human had a 1 per cent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a one percent chance of being turned into a human?  Randall does not provide a response to that one but I would have said Kenneth, if only life were like that. Wouldn’t it be fabulous?Everybody likes this book and I liked half of it, the other half was so far over my head it might have been a distant Andean condor croaking Sanskrit into a Bluetooth headset. Some of the stuff Randall devotes pages of detailed analysis to did not tickle my ivories, likeWhat would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put into an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? I mean, get a life. Who the flook cares about a hair dryer in a box? But many are very interesting. He tackles the old chestnutWhat would happen of everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same time?  He picks Rhode Island (it’s just big enough for everyone on Earth, surprisingly) as a designated place where this event might be staged, and imagines the result. In regard to the jump and the landing itself, not so much would result. But then he imagines the implications of all those people trying to get back home from Rhode Island. It’s terrible – it’s an apocalypse. If this mass jumping event was actually staged it would cause the immediate termination of civilisation and the death of billions. The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Yes it is a nice book but I do not recommend that you wolf down this book as I did in 2 days, because it’s like TOO MUCH and it can get annoying. You keep thinking of your own absurd questions – How many soldier ants would it take to chew through my leg in one hour? And would I survive? And really, there is one question which I really want to ask Randall, it’s actually been something I have been wondering about for a long time – you know those vending machines stuffed full of really unhealthy chocs and crisps and cokes? Well, imagine a person was chained to one of those and had an infinite amount of small change within arms reach. Then imagine the vending machine gets refilled by the usual contractor in the usual way (who never notices the chained person). So : how long would it take the captive to die from a constant diet of crap? If they were only eating chocs and crisps and drinking cokes? A month? Six months? A YEAR?? It’s really bugging me. I may have to launch a practical experiment. "

But hey, why the heck not? Right? XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famous.The book comes from his ""what if"" blog, which is also very good.I took the book into work with me to show it around - you know - hipster-esque and what not. I'm reading this trendy, new book first.But the guys at my table were all like, ""Yeah... I can see myself reading like 2 or 3 of these and then putting the book down..."" Everyone more or less nodded in agreement - even though they thought the book was cool.Then I looked at the book a little bit more closely, flipped through a little bit and thought, ""Huh... that sounds about right. That's probably what I'm going to do...""I'll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions... This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly. You know: ""But what if Hitler hadn't killed the Jews? Would you like him then?"" or ""What if Martin Luther King Jr. had used violence? You have to admit, it's pretty crazy that we've given this guy a holiday, right?"" He has a point.So, I took the book home - slightly shamed that I hadn't realized it was more for coffee tables than actual reading.But then I picked it up and read a couple. And a couple more. Next thing I know, a couple of days later the book is done - and I really enjoyed it. ...And I learned a lot. Well presumably.I did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroe's math. Or any of his conclusions. I mean, if I did on a couple of these, there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right? If I could take issue with a couple... I am NOT a math guy.In case there aren't any flame wars yet, let me start one: On page 114 in answer to the question, ""If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?"" he says, ""The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit. These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses. After a few days, your immune system notices and destroys it, but not before you infect, on average, one other person."" Then he has a footnote which reads, ""Mathematically, this must be true. If the average were less than one, the virus would die out. If it were more than one, eventually everyone would have a cold all the time. But that can't be right? Can it? It's tough to tell whether he's serious or not, because sometimes the footnotes are jokes, and other times they're not.But here, it made me question the math of the rest of the book. He's very meticulous in his calculations throughout, but here he doesn't factor in seasons, or how vast the globe is... Wouldn't it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection - and then people stay away from us - and are more cautious in general - which is why the number goes back down but doesn't die out completely?It took me a while to get over this, undermining the whole book for a couple seconds. Seriously, if he had just said ""but not before you infect, on average, on other person."" I wouldn't have thought twice about it.Of course, I doubted him on other footnotes: pg 134 ""Although it'sa little different, if you drip superglue on cotton thread, it will catch fire."" That can't be right can it? That's another of his jokes? Right?Munroe also interspersed ""Weird (and worrying) questions from the what if? inbox. ...Honestly, most of these weren't any weirder than the questions he was already answering. And sometimes I think they only seemed weird, but I think he may have missed the trail.Like on page 236, the question is, ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?""There's a stick figure that says ...""Asking for a friend... former friend, I mean.""But I think it's a legitimate question. And I'm pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM. - wasn't it a major plot point? So, Thomas, (the person who asked the question) wherever you are - I don't think you're a weirdo. (...Yeah, yeah, yeah... spoiler alert, if you're reading this in 1996... Although, I'd be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time, it's Munroe. He's sure studying that stuff. And Einstein. And Schrodinger. Also, probably J. Robert Oppenheimer.) And the book is so dated. He mentions the ""new-fangled writing section"" of the SAT on page 278. That was dropped way back in 2016. - Time travelling - am I right?Finally, Munroe - if you're reading this - and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already. You may hate it, but don't knock it till you've tried it, right?Seriously - loved the book. Thought I would like it, didn't think I would love it. Didn't think I would read it the whole way through - finished it in under 3 days....Also, shouldn't this go under like... a sci-fi shelf? Since the questions are hypothetical... Isn't this exactly what science-fiction is? It's just not told in narrative form in this case?"

At any rate, let’s see …Random time in the interval 45 minutes to 75 minutes: 53:51I’d better turn off the baseball game. Right.Okay, the clock is started,Author Randall Munroe writes the on-line comic strip xkcd. (See example above.)https://xkcd.com/On the site, it’s billed as A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. There’s a lot of casual references to computer stuff too. Munroe used to work at NASA as a physicist (I think), then decided to do this other gig. The gags he draws range from single frame, to three frames, to multiple frames extended down your computer screen – sometimes with rafts of text in table form, or anything else that he thinks appropriate for the laugh he’s aiming at.A couple hints for looking at xkcd.1) The humans are always drawn as stick figures. Their gender is shown by types of hairdos on the females. In the strip above, the sociologist, chemist, and mathematician are girls. Obviously.2) By hovering your mouse over the picture (not clicking) a “bonus punch line” (my phrase) will appear. (That won't happen with the cartoon above.)44:03the bookThe secondary title is SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.There might be about 60 of the Question/ANSWER articles in the book. (No time to count them.) Interspersed with these are a dozen single page pieces called “Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox”. Each page has a couple questions, with no response by the author, except for sometimes a cartoon drawing, a stick figure saying something. etc.Here’s a quite worrying example, #6Q. What is the total nutritional value (calories, fat, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the average human body? – Justin RisnerQ. What temperature would a chainsaw (or other cutting implement) need to be at to instantly cauterize any injuries inflicted with it? – Sylvia Gallaher(These are probably the worst in the book.) One of these that I wished he had answered was this one.Q. What if every day, every human had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a human? - KennethThe main entries are 3-5 pages long, mostly text, some cartoons accompanying. It’s often hard to anticipate where Munroe will go with a question.One item is called No More DNA. The question is, “This may be a bit gruesome, but … if someone’s DNA suddenly vanished, how long would that person last?”Munroe notes that the average person would be about a third of a pound lighter, then gives a list of several ways that one can lose that amount of weight easier [more safely too!] – such as peeing. When he gets to seriously addressing the question, he says, “To get an idea of what it might be like, lets turn to mushroom poisonings.” Specifically – the Amanita bisporigera. The several related species (from America and Europe) are called by the name destroying angel. These mushrooms contain amatoxin, which binds to an enzyme that is used to read information from DNA. “It hobbles the enzyme, effectively interrupting the process by which cells follow DNA’s instructions.” The amatoxin causes irreversible damage to whatever cells it collects in, in its case, the liver and kidney. There is a walking ghost phase of Amanita poisoning, where the person seems to get better – but their cells are accumulating irreversible and lethal damage. Munroe says this is probably similar to what might happen in the case of the absurd question being answered.Other examples of DNA damage he talks about are from radiation and chemotherapy.I was appropriately horrified by this piece, but I learned about a mushroom I’d never known of, that apparently can be found in the area I live in. SO I now know what it looks like, having searched it out. (Not that I eat wild mushrooms.)Most of the questions are not this disturbing, though they are equally absurd.How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?How much space does the physical internet take up?If you call a random phone number and say “God bless you,” what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed?The book is like a box of assorted chocolates. You can never tell what you’ll find inside one. It might be scary, it might be funny; it might be just plain fascinating, you might learn something really strange. You very well might want to read parts of it to your partner (share the candy). Any or all, as well as other flavors not mentioned.But the best thing about this book is to just leave it around. Pick it up and flip to a page when you have guests. Or pick it up when you have nothing better to do, and eat one of the candies again!

Answered questions include ""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?"" and ""How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?"". These are the questions that I always ask while out in the world but I tend to forget as soon as I'm home. Or out of the shower. Definitely shower thoughts.Questions not answered include ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?"" and ""How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the belly button by a cheese cutting wire?"" It's fun to laugh along with these, but it does make you realise that there is a fine line between scientist and horribly obscene psycho killers. Mad scientists are common in literature while Mad Florists not so much. So this is the book for those readers who are tired of the science question and answer compendiums full of ""Why is the sky blue?"". I adored it and I want more. "

I mean periodic tables and radioactive decay doesn't normally warrant laughter-well at least when I read about it. The questions being presented is stuff that would have never crossed my mind, but the instant I read them I was like -oh wow-what the funk if that really happened? I loved the illustrations throughout- and how the scientific info was made into such a fun, yet informative read. For sure checking out more stuff by Munroe."
137,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionWhat if is a non-fiction book that -as the name implies- gives answer to some absurd hypothetical questions. The book was fun to read until at some points it wasn’t. The author is apparently a genius, I don’t know how can he think in that way. And the dedication and time that he puts to answer these questions is amazing.I imagine the author as that student who used to sit at the front seat and answer all the questions enthusiastically.My problem was that not all the questions were simple and even if they were or if he answered them simply, he would go and make it more and more complicated until I lost interest. Still an entertaining book, specially for the science nerds!"
138,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70951605-tucker-tuckerthereader,5,"Two years after reading this for the first time, I now own two copies and re-read it monthly. ******It started with a Kindle! Well, kind of. A long time ago, I bought a Kindle Fire. If you have bought a kindle Fire, then you know that Amazon fills the box with little 'tutorials'. *cough* ads in a pretty package*cough* Anyway, What If was on the pamphlet of books to read. It looked at it and thought interesting. I later read a book called 'Know it all', a book that asked and answered scientific questions. I loved it and wanted more. So I got this. It is sooo fascinating. It is full of questions that are logical yet so hard to answer. It had so many things I had been wondering myself! This is most certainly going on my Favorite shelf!| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram"
139,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"This book was equal parts hilarious and utter nightmare fuel. I have never had such an emotionally confusing reading experience. One second, snorting my drink up my nose from laughter, the next trying to shove down the sudden and complete terror I'm experiencing because I've been forced to imagine trying to survive in six atmospheres of pressure brought upon by an expanding Earth, or collapsing into a pile of human goo because I've lost my DNA, and doing so has reminded me of my mortality and oh there goes a panic attack WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE OF LIGHTNING AND RADIATION POISONING AND THEN GET EATEN BY CATS. Unlikely potential experiences, to be sure, but that's why you don't give someone like me a book like this. Unlikely experiences are just as easy to imagine and fear irrationally and without control as likely ones, and they only stimulate the bad parts of my imagination. I am now more afraid of a global windstorm brought on by the cessation of the Earth's rotation potentially killing all life on Earth than I am of being murdered or getting a fatal disease.All that is to say, I am most likely not this book's target audience, being a completely ridiculous ball of anxiety over things that nearly 100% will never, ever, ever happen. (I have been reading XKCD since college, though. It is a constant fixture in my life, and is not terrifying.)As a result, it's hard to quantify my experience with this book. So let's add up the points:+5 stars for being so smart and clever and creative-5 stars for answering all the questions where we all die and/or the Earth is destroyed+1 star for including the weird and worrying questions from the inbox that he refused to answer--we should know our limits, people-1 star for being entirely too preoccupied with questions that involve danger+1 star for my favorite question in the book, the one about calling random people on the telephone and saying ""God Bless You,"" hoping to get someone who's just sneezed-1 star for not having more ridiculous questions like that instead of ones where all your blood is drawn out of your finger by a ridiculously high density bullet, forming a giant blood bubble around said bullet and killing you-1000 stars for me waiting the entire fucking book for the question involving the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlacc pit. This question does not exist. I have been lied to.+999 stars for the extremely obscure Kyp Durron reference that only 1 out of every 100,000 people will get (or some other number that hasn't been pulled out of my ass)+1 star for every other Star Wars reference, all of which were clever and relevant+1 star for the funny illustrations+1 star for the recurring joke about the Netherlands (and the way he incorporates things like that into all his answers)-1 star for not including in the Human Computer chapter the obvious potential scenario that the little girl was trying to lasso the cat, and the vase was knocked over in the confusion +1 star for SCIENCE!!-1 star for MATH :(+1 stars for ending the book on a happy note, ""Sometimes it's nice not to destroy the world for a change.""+1 star because the stars I ended up with didn't seem like enoughYou can do the math for yourselves. Or, you know, look up at my star rating there."
140,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori,5,This is a lot of fun from a guy who likes when things catch fire. A lot of the questions reminded me of the ones Neil Gaiman fielded after Geoff Coffey's tweet that he would donate $1 to @EFF for every person who asks @neilhimself how they can watch American Gods in their country.
141,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Randall Munroe is a dangerous guy. Seriously dangerous. He is the author of the online comic strip xkcd. It's about math, science, hacking, logic, and a host of wonderfully nerdy subjects. But in this book, Munroe answers a stack of absurd hypothetical questions. Some of the questions are really crazy, like ""What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?"" Munroe explains that the ""thud"" as everyone came down at the same time wouldn't amount to much. But, the aftermath would be catastrophic.But what's really crazy, is how Munroe takes bland questions and hypes them into incredible zingers. For example, ""If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?"" The answer, of course, is ""no"". But Munroe never stops with an answer like that. He ups the ante, increasing the power of the laser pointers, to the point where he becomes really dangerous!What is truly wonderful about this book, is that the answers are explained with scientific reasoning. Occasionally the answers are speculative, but this is clearly spelled out. Munroe usually applies scientific principles to answer the questions correctly, regardless of the level of absurdity. And, the questions and answers are all illustrated with his stick-figure cartoons, adding appreciably to the humor."
142,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"Q. What if _____?A. Nearly Everyone Would Die!- Randall Munroe, What If? There are certain things on this planet that you seemed to do fine without, but as soon as you discover, you can't now do without. Diet Dr. Pepper, David Foster Wallace, dark chocolate covered cherries all fit into this category. So, too, does Randall Munroe. He seems to occupy a space near, but not on, that vacated by Gary Larson when the great Gary Larson stopped drawing the Far Side (January 1, 1995). If you are unimpressed by Gary Larsen or the Far Side or do not know who he is or what I'm talking about, hell man, read no further. This book is not for you. I'm not trying to suggest that Gary Larson and Randall Munroe occupy the same ground. They are very different. Their approach to science is different. Their technique. However, the Venn Diagram of those readers of Gary Larson 20+ years ago would closely resemble those readers of Randall Munroe's xkcd. Nerds. They are both worshiped by nerds. They are nerd gods. In this godhead of scientific nerd entertainers also exists Bill Nye. Anyway, these are binary science artists. You either get them and love them or you don't. If you don't, well congrats, I really hope someday you will recognized what you did to our beautiful world by voting for Trump. Bastard. Anyway, this book. This book is filled with drawings and explanations by Randall Munroe on topics as diverse as:""Q. What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?""""Q. What would happen if you were to gather a mole (unit of measurement) of moles (the small furry critter) in one place?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How high can a human throw something?""Here is the magic of this book, and why it is relevant and important. It is the essentials of science. Science is always jumping into absurd places asking weird questions. Monroe capture the joy of this experience and he integrates the reader into it. He is a translator (like most scientists are) of complex methods into a narrative of explanation. He just takes several absurd, but still logical steps further. I find his book about one standard deviation better than similar attempts at similar things. I'm thinking of Leyner's books: Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour. Both are using humor and science and the strategy of funky questions. There are a couple differences, that matter. Mark Leyner isn't a scientist. He's a soft postmodernist author that is playing doctor explaining awkward questons. Monroe is a scientist that is using the scientific method and humor to explain absurd, and sometimes practically nonsense questions. While both of these books can be considered humor books, I tend to favor the one written by a scientist who can draw (kinda) dinosaurs and a pyramid of giraffes. Personal preference I guess. Anyway, if you or anyone in your family is a nerd, or raising a nerd, and enjoy absurdity and funky questions, well, this is almost a perfect book. If not, go ahead and try and to convince me that your vote for Trump isn't going to be considered the beginning of the end of our civilization. You have no soul. "
143,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Update: He published a lot more that aren't in this book. Read them for free here:http://what-if.xkcd.com/archive/So... I love xkcd & some of these questions were really interesting - funny on the face with some really interesting science & math backing up the answer. For instance, the bullet being hit by lightning got into quite a few interesting facts about lightning. Who wouldn't want to know if a machine gun jet pack would work including discussions on caliber, barrel burn out, & fire rates? Cooking a steak via a high altitude drop wasn't nearly as crazy as a mole of moles, but they would make an interesting planetoid. I never would have thought of that on my own. This isn't a book to just sit down & read. The questions & answers often require contemplation. Yoda powered houses probably won't catch on, but discovering just what his maximum power output was when he picked Luke's X-wing out of the swamp got into equations about power & how many Yodas it would take to power our civilization. Sure, I learned them in 9th grade physics, but the refresher was a whole lot more interesting than Ms. Hummel's class ever was. (Sorry, Ms. Hummel. Your class was interesting & figuring out horsepower by running up a flight of stairs was great, but... well... Yoda. Yes, I know your class was long before even the first Star Wars movie, but... Yoda-power. How green can you get?)And then there are the Weird & Worrying Questions sections that dotted this odd amalgamation. Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee? is fairly horrifying, but whatever turns you on. Is it possible to cry so much you dehydrate yourself? is sad, but they're still pure entertainment for me. If I were Munroe & had to worry about the people sending those emails, I might well disconnect from society & move to the middle of northern Alberta, Canada. You think I exaggerate? How many houses are burned down in the United States every year? What would be the easiest way to increase that number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)? How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Eeek! There are some scary people out there!Highly recommended in small doses!"

But to my dismay, I don't think that he fully appreciated the genius of it, but well... some people are colorblind. Life is sometimes cruel like that. Anyway, this book was great. I've been a fan of XKCD for a long time now, and even if this book was crap, I'd have happily purchased a copy just to support Randall Munroe for my previous webcomic enjoyment. But this book was not crap. It was great. Interesting question content, well-thought out and researched answers, just the right mixture of humor to balance out the brain 'splody math stuff... I loved it. I'm going to give this book three awards: First, for best comedic use of [citation needed]. Second, for best usage of footnote text EVAR.

What If?, or Serendipity; or the Literary/Pop Culture Quotes Quiz
Late at night, about a week ago, I went through the Top Quotes pages of Goodreads. A hundred pages, each with thirty quotes: that's 3000 quotes. I have problems. I was searching for quotes that included (on the most part, primarily consisted of) a line in the form of 'If A, B' (let's call it an If quote, or IQ) - I'd compiled them because I had a certain idea for a review where I would use them.What's the catch? The idea was for the review of another book - not What If?. But the day after the nighttime scavenging, I decided against using it because my sense of reviewing aesthetics decided to go with another idea. The result was that I had all these IQ's sitting in a file on my desktop, but they were left completely untouched because I didn't plan to use them any more, while regretting how I should have thought about it more before compiling them in the first place.Fast forward a week, and today I finished Munroe's book. I hadn't really thought about reviewing it (immediately, anyway), but tonight I glanced at the book the review of which the IQ's were meant for on my desk, and it hit me.What If? questions. If... quotes. So I'm able to use my dear IQ's for a review after all. Ladies and gentlemen, that's serendipity for you.From the 3000 quotes, there were a surprising amount of IQ's. I'd estimate there were 60 or so quotes including an If... line (citation needed), of which I had copied 45 of into my file for their quality and validity of use in my review for that other book. I'd like to make it 50 for a nicer number but no artificial perfectionism here - science needs integrity.Here's how the IQ's fit into this review:1. I give you the first half of each IQ (the If A).2. You'll also be given the author of the quote.3. Your task is to see how many of the B's you can fill out. The answers are hidden under the spoiler tags. Better leave peeking at the answer for after you've answered a series by the same author since they might be a giveaway.4. Write your test score /45 in the comments section (give me some love, joy and social validation). For the answers, if they are relatively close you can give yourself the mark.5. Cheaters, if found, will be reported to the Internet Police.Got your pen and paper? Your writing time starts...now.1.

Update:
 This is my first experience in reading a book in paper-copy and having it actually change how much I enjoyed it. A friend who knows me all too well gave me the hardcover version of What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions as a birthday present- and reading it as an ebook just didn't do it justice. The laugh-factor jumped by several orders of magnitude! So here's to Randal Munroe, XKCD and keeping physical books alive!The brain behind 

xkcd

, 

Randall Munroe

, has been churning out even more than his nerdy and hilarious stick-figure comics. This wunderkind also answers to imaginative queries submitted by us lay-folk in 

What if?

, a sort of xkcd sub-blog. So, yes, this is a book-ified blog, which isn't always a bad thing. I actually hadn't really followed the blog prior to reading the book, and was surprised by the balance Munroe is able to strike to make his answers both “scientific” and accessible. Any curious kid could enjoy the book, and the same goes for adults (though if you're hoping for rigorous calculations you will be disappointed).  The weird thing about hypothetical questions, though, is that depending on your audience, sometimes the answer you'll get is ‘Who cares?’ And, for whatever reason, my interest arbitrarily waxed and waned. For example: - Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward firing machine guns? Fascinating! Do tell...

- What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power was turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1 meter box? Better question: Why would you ever want to know that?

I found easily three-quarters of the questions interesting, so I won't dock serious points for that, and that wouldn't be problematic if I were more of a browser-type reader.  Of course, extra love added for a veritable rolling mental montage of 
Archer
 tie-ins. The 
Weightless Arrow
 question (something to the effect of: would the friction of air eventually stop an arrow in a zero-gravity environment?) could be easily answered by my favorite world's greatest secret agent.

150,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4217214-steve-alexander,5,This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. And I have read over 10 books.
151,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/922495-patrick,5,"I've been a reader of XKCD for ages. Not just a reader, a fan. A big goey, geeky fan. So much of a fan that when I heard about this book, I went so far as to abuse my power as an author to get an Advance Reading Copy of the book, so that I could enjoy its deliciousness sooner. And... y'know... taunt people on the internet. And it worked. I got an early copy. And I treasured it. I petted it. It was precious to me. Precious. Then life got in the way. Conventions. Promotion for my own book launch. I had dad stuff to do. I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser. Then I had my book tour.... Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did. "
152,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?"

  Trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.
Randall Munroe, ex-NASA employee and author of the wildly popular webcomic XKCD, decides to look at several, undoubtedly, absurd questions and find scientific answers to them.Nothing is too absurd for him - whether it be the logistics of finding your soulmate to what happens if our moon suddenly disappears - Munroe answers it all.
But I’ve never seen the Icarus story as a lesson about the limitations of humans. I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.
I absolutely loved the tone of voice throughout the book. 
There’s no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word “NO” scrawled over and over in charred blood.
His hilarious deadpan just absolutely cinched this book for me. 
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.
 
Who knew that physics could be so fun? 
Honestly, teachers need to stop the whole calculate-the-gravity-of-a-falling-ball shtick and jump on the calculate-the-force-of-wind-turbines-powered-by-people-at-a-gym bandwagon. Seriously, just make learning fun and the rest will go from there.In short - yes!

Dear Mr. Munroe, please consider this a standing invitation.When I was five, I was trying to figure out how difficult it would be to reach the Moon if I were to stack chairs on top of each other (for a head start, beginning this enterprise from the roof of a 9-story building). I was sure about a 1000 would do. I should have just contacted Randall Munroe.
 “DISCLAIMER: Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind.”
This book will provide you with detailed physics and mathematics solutions to a plethora of …ahem… interesting questions. I picked a few just to convey to you how deep the sheer awesomeness of ‘What If’ goes.——————————————————————
 “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?”
Munroe approaches this very important question with scientific rigor. After consulting literature on the steak drag coefficient, US military studies from the Cold War era, “research papers on the heating of ICBM nose cones as they reenter the atmosphere” and a cookbook (duh!), making an assumption that “Steaks can probably survive breaking the sound barrier”, and after making amazing graphs such as the one below …

 … he finally comes to the obvious conclusion that “we should drop the steak over Pittsburgh” (because of the tradition of “Pittsburgh rare” steaks there), and our elegant answer is:
 “So drop your steak from a suborbital rocket, send out a collection team to recover it, brush it off, reheat it, cut away any badly charred sections, and dig in.Just watch out for salmonella. And the Andromeda Strain.”
—————————————
 “How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?”
Some simple models clearly give you the only plausible answer: Netherlands will become a supraplanetary entity. To see how, you need to read for yourself.


“Supposing you did drain the oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?”
Again, the answer is clear — it’s a future that will be Netherlands-shaped:
—————————————
“What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?”
Brief answer: “NEARLY EVERYONE WOULD DIE. Then things would get interesting.”—————————————
 “What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?”
Answer: “Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.”
—————————————
 “How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?”

“Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90 percent of the speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.”———————————
 “How much Force power can Yoda output?”
“I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.”
After a fair share of assumptions and equations, it’s blatantly obvious that Yoda is a much better power source than Luke Skywalker. But a word of caution before we change our power grid to Yoda-based: “So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would definitely be green.”5 stars. If I’m ever shipwrecked on a remote island, I hope to have this book with me — maybe somewhere in its depths there’s a calculation of how long I can last before resorting to cannibalism."
157,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seen:""Do not try any of this at home.

The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting, directly or indirectly, from information contained in this book.""That disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science: Dangerous ideas ahead, folks! Don't get too close -- these things could kill ya!Randall Munroe used to work at NASA, and now he creates the webcomic XKCD (which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig). On his website, he takes ""absurd hypothetical questions"" from readers and tries to answer some of them. Here are some of my favorite questions in this book:What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?Which US state is actually flown over the most?Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?How high can a human throw something?How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?When, if ever, will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?How many Lego bricks would it take to build a bridge capable of carrying traffic from London to New York? Have that many Lego bricks been manufactured?What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?If you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions, this book is for you! What made this so much fun, aside from the ridiculous questions, is Munroe's sense of humor. Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers, which is not something that usually happens when I'm reading about science. Oh, and be sure to read his footnotes, which have even more jokes.I think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works. I think I would have loved it when I was 10. *I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book, because I had never heard of the author before. It's the miracle of Goodreads! "
158,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"Mr Munroe includes some “weird and worrying” questions from his website’s inbox which he presents without attempting to answer – one favourite was:If you saved a whole life’s worth of kissing and used all that suction power on one single kiss, how much suction force would that single kiss have?I guess the answer might be “what pharmaceutical products have you ingested during the last four hours?” or “May I speak to your parents?”Another person named Jon Merrill askedHow fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Answer has to be “as fast as I will be running if I ever meet you Jon”.And a person called Kenneth askedWhat if every day, every human had a 1 per cent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a one percent chance of being turned into a human?  Randall does not provide a response to that one but I would have said Kenneth, if only life were like that. Wouldn’t it be fabulous?Everybody likes this book and I liked half of it, the other half was so far over my head it might have been a distant Andean condor croaking Sanskrit into a Bluetooth headset. Some of the stuff Randall devotes pages of detailed analysis to did not tickle my ivories, likeWhat would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put into an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? I mean, get a life. Who the flook cares about a hair dryer in a box? But many are very interesting. He tackles the old chestnutWhat would happen of everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same time?  He picks Rhode Island (it’s just big enough for everyone on Earth, surprisingly) as a designated place where this event might be staged, and imagines the result. In regard to the jump and the landing itself, not so much would result. But then he imagines the implications of all those people trying to get back home from Rhode Island. It’s terrible – it’s an apocalypse. If this mass jumping event was actually staged it would cause the immediate termination of civilisation and the death of billions. The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Yes it is a nice book but I do not recommend that you wolf down this book as I did in 2 days, because it’s like TOO MUCH and it can get annoying. You keep thinking of your own absurd questions – How many soldier ants would it take to chew through my leg in one hour? And would I survive? And really, there is one question which I really want to ask Randall, it’s actually been something I have been wondering about for a long time – you know those vending machines stuffed full of really unhealthy chocs and crisps and cokes? Well, imagine a person was chained to one of those and had an infinite amount of small change within arms reach. Then imagine the vending machine gets refilled by the usual contractor in the usual way (who never notices the chained person). So : how long would it take the captive to die from a constant diet of crap? If they were only eating chocs and crisps and drinking cokes? A month? Six months? A YEAR?? It’s really bugging me. I may have to launch a practical experiment. "

But hey, why the heck not? Right? XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famous.The book comes from his ""what if"" blog, which is also very good.I took the book into work with me to show it around - you know - hipster-esque and what not. I'm reading this trendy, new book first.But the guys at my table were all like, ""Yeah... I can see myself reading like 2 or 3 of these and then putting the book down..."" Everyone more or less nodded in agreement - even though they thought the book was cool.Then I looked at the book a little bit more closely, flipped through a little bit and thought, ""Huh... that sounds about right. That's probably what I'm going to do...""I'll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions... This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly. You know: ""But what if Hitler hadn't killed the Jews? Would you like him then?"" or ""What if Martin Luther King Jr. had used violence? You have to admit, it's pretty crazy that we've given this guy a holiday, right?"" He has a point.So, I took the book home - slightly shamed that I hadn't realized it was more for coffee tables than actual reading.But then I picked it up and read a couple. And a couple more. Next thing I know, a couple of days later the book is done - and I really enjoyed it. ...And I learned a lot. Well presumably.I did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroe's math. Or any of his conclusions. I mean, if I did on a couple of these, there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right? If I could take issue with a couple... I am NOT a math guy.In case there aren't any flame wars yet, let me start one: On page 114 in answer to the question, ""If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?"" he says, ""The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit. These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses. After a few days, your immune system notices and destroys it, but not before you infect, on average, one other person."" Then he has a footnote which reads, ""Mathematically, this must be true. If the average were less than one, the virus would die out. If it were more than one, eventually everyone would have a cold all the time. But that can't be right? Can it? It's tough to tell whether he's serious or not, because sometimes the footnotes are jokes, and other times they're not.But here, it made me question the math of the rest of the book. He's very meticulous in his calculations throughout, but here he doesn't factor in seasons, or how vast the globe is... Wouldn't it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection - and then people stay away from us - and are more cautious in general - which is why the number goes back down but doesn't die out completely?It took me a while to get over this, undermining the whole book for a couple seconds. Seriously, if he had just said ""but not before you infect, on average, on other person."" I wouldn't have thought twice about it.Of course, I doubted him on other footnotes: pg 134 ""Although it'sa little different, if you drip superglue on cotton thread, it will catch fire."" That can't be right can it? That's another of his jokes? Right?Munroe also interspersed ""Weird (and worrying) questions from the what if? inbox. ...Honestly, most of these weren't any weirder than the questions he was already answering. And sometimes I think they only seemed weird, but I think he may have missed the trail.Like on page 236, the question is, ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?""There's a stick figure that says ...""Asking for a friend... former friend, I mean.""But I think it's a legitimate question. And I'm pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM. - wasn't it a major plot point? So, Thomas, (the person who asked the question) wherever you are - I don't think you're a weirdo. (...Yeah, yeah, yeah... spoiler alert, if you're reading this in 1996... Although, I'd be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time, it's Munroe. He's sure studying that stuff. And Einstein. And Schrodinger. Also, probably J. Robert Oppenheimer.) And the book is so dated. He mentions the ""new-fangled writing section"" of the SAT on page 278. That was dropped way back in 2016. - Time travelling - am I right?Finally, Munroe - if you're reading this - and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already. You may hate it, but don't knock it till you've tried it, right?Seriously - loved the book. Thought I would like it, didn't think I would love it. Didn't think I would read it the whole way through - finished it in under 3 days....Also, shouldn't this go under like... a sci-fi shelf? Since the questions are hypothetical... Isn't this exactly what science-fiction is? It's just not told in narrative form in this case?"

At any rate, let’s see …Random time in the interval 45 minutes to 75 minutes: 53:51I’d better turn off the baseball game. Right.Okay, the clock is started,Author Randall Munroe writes the on-line comic strip xkcd. (See example above.)https://xkcd.com/On the site, it’s billed as A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. There’s a lot of casual references to computer stuff too. Munroe used to work at NASA as a physicist (I think), then decided to do this other gig. The gags he draws range from single frame, to three frames, to multiple frames extended down your computer screen – sometimes with rafts of text in table form, or anything else that he thinks appropriate for the laugh he’s aiming at.A couple hints for looking at xkcd.1) The humans are always drawn as stick figures. Their gender is shown by types of hairdos on the females. In the strip above, the sociologist, chemist, and mathematician are girls. Obviously.2) By hovering your mouse over the picture (not clicking) a “bonus punch line” (my phrase) will appear. (That won't happen with the cartoon above.)44:03the bookThe secondary title is SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.There might be about 60 of the Question/ANSWER articles in the book. (No time to count them.) Interspersed with these are a dozen single page pieces called “Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox”. Each page has a couple questions, with no response by the author, except for sometimes a cartoon drawing, a stick figure saying something. etc.Here’s a quite worrying example, #6Q. What is the total nutritional value (calories, fat, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the average human body? – Justin RisnerQ. What temperature would a chainsaw (or other cutting implement) need to be at to instantly cauterize any injuries inflicted with it? – Sylvia Gallaher(These are probably the worst in the book.) One of these that I wished he had answered was this one.Q. What if every day, every human had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a human? - KennethThe main entries are 3-5 pages long, mostly text, some cartoons accompanying. It’s often hard to anticipate where Munroe will go with a question.One item is called No More DNA. The question is, “This may be a bit gruesome, but … if someone’s DNA suddenly vanished, how long would that person last?”Munroe notes that the average person would be about a third of a pound lighter, then gives a list of several ways that one can lose that amount of weight easier [more safely too!] – such as peeing. When he gets to seriously addressing the question, he says, “To get an idea of what it might be like, lets turn to mushroom poisonings.” Specifically – the Amanita bisporigera. The several related species (from America and Europe) are called by the name destroying angel. These mushrooms contain amatoxin, which binds to an enzyme that is used to read information from DNA. “It hobbles the enzyme, effectively interrupting the process by which cells follow DNA’s instructions.” The amatoxin causes irreversible damage to whatever cells it collects in, in its case, the liver and kidney. There is a walking ghost phase of Amanita poisoning, where the person seems to get better – but their cells are accumulating irreversible and lethal damage. Munroe says this is probably similar to what might happen in the case of the absurd question being answered.Other examples of DNA damage he talks about are from radiation and chemotherapy.I was appropriately horrified by this piece, but I learned about a mushroom I’d never known of, that apparently can be found in the area I live in. SO I now know what it looks like, having searched it out. (Not that I eat wild mushrooms.)Most of the questions are not this disturbing, though they are equally absurd.How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?How much space does the physical internet take up?If you call a random phone number and say “God bless you,” what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed?The book is like a box of assorted chocolates. You can never tell what you’ll find inside one. It might be scary, it might be funny; it might be just plain fascinating, you might learn something really strange. You very well might want to read parts of it to your partner (share the candy). Any or all, as well as other flavors not mentioned.But the best thing about this book is to just leave it around. Pick it up and flip to a page when you have guests. Or pick it up when you have nothing better to do, and eat one of the candies again!

Definitely shower thoughts.Questions not answered include ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?"" and ""How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the belly button by a cheese cutting wire?"" It's fun to laugh along with these, but it does make you realise that there is a fine line between scientist and horribly obscene psycho killers. Mad scientists are common in literature while Mad Florists not so much. So this is the book for those readers who are tired of the science question and answer compendiums full of ""Why is the sky blue?"". I adored it and I want more. "

I mean periodic tables and radioactive decay doesn't normally warrant laughter-well at least when I read about it. The questions being presented is stuff that would have never crossed my mind, but the instant I read them I was like -oh wow-what the funk if that really happened? I loved the illustrations throughout- and how the scientific info was made into such a fun, yet informative read. For sure checking out more stuff by Munroe."
167,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionWhat if is a non-fiction book that -as the name implies- gives answer to some absurd hypothetical questions. The book was fun to read until at some points it wasn’t. The author is apparently a genius, I don’t know how can he think in that way. And the dedication and time that he puts to answer these questions is amazing.I imagine the author as that student who used to sit at the front seat and answer all the questions enthusiastically.My problem was that not all the questions were simple and even if they were or if he answered them simply, he would go and make it more and more complicated until I lost interest. Still an entertaining book, specially for the science nerds!"
168,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70951605-tucker-tuckerthereader,5,"Two years after reading this for the first time, I now own two copies and re-read it monthly. ******It started with a Kindle! Well, kind of. A long time ago, I bought a Kindle Fire. If you have bought a kindle Fire, then you know that Amazon fills the box with little 'tutorials'. *cough* ads in a pretty package*cough* Anyway, What If was on the pamphlet of books to read. It looked at it and thought interesting. I later read a book called 'Know it all', a book that asked and answered scientific questions. I loved it and wanted more. So I got this. It is sooo fascinating. It is full of questions that are logical yet so hard to answer. It had so many things I had been wondering myself! This is most certainly going on my Favorite shelf!| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram"
169,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"This book was equal parts hilarious and utter nightmare fuel. I have never had such an emotionally confusing reading experience. One second, snorting my drink up my nose from laughter, the next trying to shove down the sudden and complete terror I'm experiencing because I've been forced to imagine trying to survive in six atmospheres of pressure brought upon by an expanding Earth, or collapsing into a pile of human goo because I've lost my DNA, and doing so has reminded me of my mortality and oh there goes a panic attack WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE OF LIGHTNING AND RADIATION POISONING AND THEN GET EATEN BY CATS. Unlikely potential experiences, to be sure, but that's why you don't give someone like me a book like this. Unlikely experiences are just as easy to imagine and fear irrationally and without control as likely ones, and they only stimulate the bad parts of my imagination. I am now more afraid of a global windstorm brought on by the cessation of the Earth's rotation potentially killing all life on Earth than I am of being murdered or getting a fatal disease.All that is to say, I am most likely not this book's target audience, being a completely ridiculous ball of anxiety over things that nearly 100% will never, ever, ever happen. (I have been reading XKCD since college, though. It is a constant fixture in my life, and is not terrifying.)As a result, it's hard to quantify my experience with this book. So let's add up the points:+5 stars for being so smart and clever and creative-5 stars for answering all the questions where we all die and/or the Earth is destroyed+1 star for including the weird and worrying questions from the inbox that he refused to answer--we should know our limits, people-1 star for being entirely too preoccupied with questions that involve danger+1 star for my favorite question in the book, the one about calling random people on the telephone and saying ""God Bless You,"" hoping to get someone who's just sneezed-1 star for not having more ridiculous questions like that instead of ones where all your blood is drawn out of your finger by a ridiculously high density bullet, forming a giant blood bubble around said bullet and killing you-1000 stars for me waiting the entire fucking book for the question involving the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlacc pit. This question does not exist. I have been lied to.+999 stars for the extremely obscure Kyp Durron reference that only 1 out of every 100,000 people will get (or some other number that hasn't been pulled out of my ass)+1 star for every other Star Wars reference, all of which were clever and relevant+1 star for the funny illustrations+1 star for the recurring joke about the Netherlands (and the way he incorporates things like that into all his answers)-1 star for not including in the Human Computer chapter the obvious potential scenario that the little girl was trying to lasso the cat, and the vase was knocked over in the confusion +1 star for SCIENCE!!-1 star for MATH :(+1 stars for ending the book on a happy note, ""Sometimes it's nice not to destroy the world for a change.""+1 star because the stars I ended up with didn't seem like enoughYou can do the math for yourselves. Or, you know, look up at my star rating there."
170,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori,5,This is a lot of fun from a guy who likes when things catch fire. A lot of the questions reminded me of the ones Neil Gaiman fielded after Geoff Coffey's tweet that he would donate $1 to @EFF for every person who asks @neilhimself how they can watch American Gods in their country.
171,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Randall Munroe is a dangerous guy. Seriously dangerous. He is the author of the online comic strip xkcd. It's about math, science, hacking, logic, and a host of wonderfully nerdy subjects. But in this book, Munroe answers a stack of absurd hypothetical questions. Some of the questions are really crazy, like ""What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?"" Munroe explains that the ""thud"" as everyone came down at the same time wouldn't amount to much. But, the aftermath would be catastrophic.But what's really crazy, is how Munroe takes bland questions and hypes them into incredible zingers. For example, ""If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?"" The answer, of course, is ""no"". But Munroe never stops with an answer like that. He ups the ante, increasing the power of the laser pointers, to the point where he becomes really dangerous!What is truly wonderful about this book, is that the answers are explained with scientific reasoning. Occasionally the answers are speculative, but this is clearly spelled out. Munroe usually applies scientific principles to answer the questions correctly, regardless of the level of absurdity. And, the questions and answers are all illustrated with his stick-figure cartoons, adding appreciably to the humor."
172,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"Q. What if _____?A. Nearly Everyone Would Die!- Randall Munroe, What If? There are certain things on this planet that you seemed to do fine without, but as soon as you discover, you can't now do without. Diet Dr. Pepper, David Foster Wallace, dark chocolate covered cherries all fit into this category. So, too, does Randall Munroe. He seems to occupy a space near, but not on, that vacated by Gary Larson when the great Gary Larson stopped drawing the Far Side (January 1, 1995). If you are unimpressed by Gary Larsen or the Far Side or do not know who he is or what I'm talking about, hell man, read no further. This book is not for you. I'm not trying to suggest that Gary Larson and Randall Munroe occupy the same ground. They are very different. Their approach to science is different. Their technique. However, the Venn Diagram of those readers of Gary Larson 20+ years ago would closely resemble those readers of Randall Munroe's xkcd. Nerds. They are both worshiped by nerds. They are nerd gods. In this godhead of scientific nerd entertainers also exists Bill Nye. Anyway, these are binary science artists. You either get them and love them or you don't. If you don't, well congrats, I really hope someday you will recognized what you did to our beautiful world by voting for Trump. Bastard. Anyway, this book. This book is filled with drawings and explanations by Randall Munroe on topics as diverse as:""Q. What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?""""Q. What would happen if you were to gather a mole (unit of measurement) of moles (the small furry critter) in one place?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How high can a human throw something?""Here is the magic of this book, and why it is relevant and important. It is the essentials of science. Science is always jumping into absurd places asking weird questions. Monroe capture the joy of this experience and he integrates the reader into it. He is a translator (like most scientists are) of complex methods into a narrative of explanation. He just takes several absurd, but still logical steps further. I find his book about one standard deviation better than similar attempts at similar things. I'm thinking of Leyner's books: Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour. Both are using humor and science and the strategy of funky questions. There are a couple differences, that matter. Mark Leyner isn't a scientist. He's a soft postmodernist author that is playing doctor explaining awkward questons. Monroe is a scientist that is using the scientific method and humor to explain absurd, and sometimes practically nonsense questions. While both of these books can be considered humor books, I tend to favor the one written by a scientist who can draw (kinda) dinosaurs and a pyramid of giraffes. Personal preference I guess. Anyway, if you or anyone in your family is a nerd, or raising a nerd, and enjoy absurdity and funky questions, well, this is almost a perfect book. If not, go ahead and try and to convince me that your vote for Trump isn't going to be considered the beginning of the end of our civilization. You have no soul. "
173,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Update: He published a lot more that aren't in this book. Read them for free here:http://what-if.xkcd.com/archive/So... I love xkcd & some of these questions were really interesting - funny on the face with some really interesting science & math backing up the answer. For instance, the bullet being hit by lightning got into quite a few interesting facts about lightning. Who wouldn't want to know if a machine gun jet pack would work including discussions on caliber, barrel burn out, & fire rates? Cooking a steak via a high altitude drop wasn't nearly as crazy as a mole of moles, but they would make an interesting planetoid. I never would have thought of that on my own. This isn't a book to just sit down & read. The questions & answers often require contemplation. Yoda powered houses probably won't catch on, but discovering just what his maximum power output was when he picked Luke's X-wing out of the swamp got into equations about power & how many Yodas it would take to power our civilization. Sure, I learned them in 9th grade physics, but the refresher was a whole lot more interesting than Ms. Hummel's class ever was. (Sorry, Ms. Hummel. Your class was interesting & figuring out horsepower by running up a flight of stairs was great, but... well... Yoda. Yes, I know your class was long before even the first Star Wars movie, but... Yoda-power. How green can you get?)And then there are the Weird & Worrying Questions sections that dotted this odd amalgamation. Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee? is fairly horrifying, but whatever turns you on. Is it possible to cry so much you dehydrate yourself? is sad, but they're still pure entertainment for me. If I were Munroe & had to worry about the people sending those emails, I might well disconnect from society & move to the middle of northern Alberta, Canada. You think I exaggerate? How many houses are burned down in the United States every year? What would be the easiest way to increase that number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)? How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Eeek! There are some scary people out there!Highly recommended in small doses!"

But to my dismay, I don't think that he fully appreciated the genius of it, but well... some people are colorblind. Life is sometimes cruel like that. Anyway, this book was great. I've been a fan of XKCD for a long time now, and even if this book was crap, I'd have happily purchased a copy just to support Randall Munroe for my previous webcomic enjoyment. But this book was not crap. It was great. Interesting question content, well-thought out and researched answers, just the right mixture of humor to balance out the brain 'splody math stuff... I loved it. I'm going to give this book three awards: First, for best comedic use of [citation needed]. Second, for best usage of footnote text EVAR.

What If?, or Serendipity; or the Literary/Pop Culture Quotes Quiz
Late at night, about a week ago, I went through the Top Quotes pages of Goodreads. A hundred pages, each with thirty quotes: that's 3000 quotes. I have problems. I was searching for quotes that included (on the most part, primarily consisted of) a line in the form of 'If A, B' (let's call it an If quote, or IQ) - I'd compiled them because I had a certain idea for a review where I would use them.What's the catch? The idea was for the review of another book - not What If?. But the day after the nighttime scavenging, I decided against using it because my sense of reviewing aesthetics decided to go with another idea. The result was that I had all these IQ's sitting in a file on my desktop, but they were left completely untouched because I didn't plan to use them any more, while regretting how I should have thought about it more before compiling them in the first place.Fast forward a week, and today I finished Munroe's book. I hadn't really thought about reviewing it (immediately, anyway), but tonight I glanced at the book the review of which the IQ's were meant for on my desk, and it hit me.What If? questions. If... quotes. So I'm able to use my dear IQ's for a review after all. Ladies and gentlemen, that's serendipity for you.From the 3000 quotes, there were a surprising amount of IQ's. I'd estimate there were 60 or so quotes including an If... line (citation needed), of which I had copied 45 of into my file for their quality and validity of use in my review for that other book. I'd like to make it 50 for a nicer number but no artificial perfectionism here - science needs integrity.Here's how the IQ's fit into this review:1. I give you the first half of each IQ (the If A).2. You'll also be given the author of the quote.3. Your task is to see how many of the B's you can fill out. The answers are hidden under the spoiler tags. Better leave peeking at the answer for after you've answered a series by the same author since they might be a giveaway.4. Write your test score /45 in the comments section (give me some love, joy and social validation). For the answers, if they are relatively close you can give yourself the mark.5. Cheaters, if found, will be reported to the Internet Police.Got your pen and paper? Your writing time starts...now.1.

Update:
 This is my first experience in reading a book in paper-copy and having it actually change how much I enjoyed it. A friend who knows me all too well gave me the hardcover version of What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions as a birthday present- and reading it as an ebook just didn't do it justice. The laugh-factor jumped by several orders of magnitude! So here's to Randal Munroe, XKCD and keeping physical books alive!The brain behind 

xkcd

, 

Randall Munroe

, has been churning out even more than his nerdy and hilarious stick-figure comics. This wunderkind also answers to imaginative queries submitted by us lay-folk in 

What if?

, a sort of xkcd sub-blog. So, yes, this is a book-ified blog, which isn't always a bad thing. I actually hadn't really followed the blog prior to reading the book, and was surprised by the balance Munroe is able to strike to make his answers both “scientific” and accessible. Any curious kid could enjoy the book, and the same goes for adults (though if you're hoping for rigorous calculations you will be disappointed).  The weird thing about hypothetical questions, though, is that depending on your audience, sometimes the answer you'll get is ‘Who cares?’ And, for whatever reason, my interest arbitrarily waxed and waned. For example: - Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward firing machine guns? Fascinating! Do tell...

- What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power was turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1 meter box? Better question: Why would you ever want to know that?

I found easily three-quarters of the questions interesting, so I won't dock serious points for that, and that wouldn't be problematic if I were more of a browser-type reader.  Of course, extra love added for a veritable rolling mental montage of 
Archer
 tie-ins. The 
Weightless Arrow
 question (something to the effect of: would the friction of air eventually stop an arrow in a zero-gravity environment?) could be easily answered by my favorite world's greatest secret agent.

180,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4217214-steve-alexander,5,This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. And I have read over 10 books.
181,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/922495-patrick,5,"I've been a reader of XKCD for ages. Not just a reader, a fan. A big goey, geeky fan. So much of a fan that when I heard about this book, I went so far as to abuse my power as an author to get an Advance Reading Copy of the book, so that I could enjoy its deliciousness sooner. And... y'know... taunt people on the internet. And it worked. I got an early copy. And I treasured it. I petted it. It was precious to me. Precious. Then life got in the way. Conventions. Promotion for my own book launch. I had dad stuff to do. I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser. Then I had my book tour.... Through all of this, I carried my precious ARC around, waiting for the time when I'd be able to spare the brainpower to read it. I even took it on tour with me. (Honestly, this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put together.)It wasn't until I got back home that I started it. I wanted something to read before I went to bed, and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book I'd be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule. Despite my best intentions, I read half the book that night. It cost me precious sleep I couldn't afford to lose. But I don't regret it. Not a bit. It's clever, but if you know anything about Randall Munroe, that won't come as a surprise to you. And it's funny, and witty (which are two different things, by the way.) But again to readers of XKCD this won't come as any sort of surprise. The surprise was how *easy* it was to read. There's some decent science in there, but it wasn't anywhere nearly as brain-taxing as I'd expected. Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply. That's a rare gift. The other surprise is how much it pulled me in. I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks. Instead, I tore through it. That's not usually the case for me with non-fiction books. In brief, it's worth your time. Even if you haven't read his comic. Even if you haven't ever heard of Randall Munroe. Even if you're not into science. You should pick this up and read it. You'll be glad you did. "
182,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Q: What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of What If tomorrow morning?A: Actually, less than you'd think.First, a little background about this book. If you're a geek, it's unputdownable, a word that, if you think carefully, means ""cannot be put down"". (You may not be aware of this fact, since the word is nearly always misused). So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast, through lunch, while he's supposed to be working, and on through dinner, ignoring the non-geek guests who have come to visit. He'll interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like ""Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks?"" or ""How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux?"". He'll finish just as the last guest leaves.There is a common myth, most likely spread by geeks, that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization. If you're easily impressed by this kind of propaganda, you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals, nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels, and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work. All that sounds pretty bad.But let's stop and consider for a moment. Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable? Hardly. Geeks are always doing this kind of thing, and society has learned to work around them. Important as they may be in the long run, there's always some dependable non-geek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon. The non-geek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speed-chess session and is ready to do whatever it is they're actually being paid to do.So delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects. It will make a great many geeks very happy, and (assuming of course that the copies are paid for) it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaire.And who could possibly have anything against that?"

  Trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.
Randall Munroe, ex-NASA employee and author of the wildly popular webcomic XKCD, decides to look at several, undoubtedly, absurd questions and find scientific answers to them.Nothing is too absurd for him - whether it be the logistics of finding your soulmate to what happens if our moon suddenly disappears - Munroe answers it all.
But I’ve never seen the Icarus story as a lesson about the limitations of humans. I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.
I absolutely loved the tone of voice throughout the book. 
There’s no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word “NO” scrawled over and over in charred blood.
His hilarious deadpan just absolutely cinched this book for me. 
It’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the sudden stop at the end.

Honestly, teachers need to stop the whole calculate-the-gravity-of-a-falling-ball shtick and jump on the calculate-the-force-of-wind-turbines-powered-by-people-at-a-gym bandwagon. Seriously, just make learning fun and the rest will go from there.In short - yes!

Dear Mr. Munroe, please consider this a standing invitation.When I was five, I was trying to figure out how difficult it would be to reach the Moon if I were to stack chairs on top of each other (for a head start, beginning this enterprise from the roof of a 9-story building). I was sure about a 1000 would do. I should have just contacted Randall Munroe.
 “DISCLAIMER: Do not try any of this at home. The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist, not a health or safety expert. He likes it when things catch fire or explode, which means he does not have your best interests in mind.”
This book will provide you with detailed physics and mathematics solutions to a plethora of …ahem… interesting questions. I picked a few just to convey to you how deep the sheer awesomeness of ‘What If’ goes.——————————————————————
 “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?”
Munroe approaches this very important question with scientific rigor. After consulting literature on the steak drag coefficient, US military studies from the Cold War era, “research papers on the heating of ICBM nose cones as they reenter the atmosphere” and a cookbook (duh!), making an assumption that “Steaks can probably survive breaking the sound barrier”, and after making amazing graphs such as the one below …

 … he finally comes to the obvious conclusion that “we should drop the steak over Pittsburgh” (because of the tradition of “Pittsburgh rare” steaks there), and our elegant answer is:
 “So drop your steak from a suborbital rocket, send out a collection team to recover it, brush it off, reheat it, cut away any badly charred sections, and dig in.Just watch out for salmonella. And the Andromeda Strain.”
—————————————
 “How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?”
Some simple models clearly give you the only plausible answer: Netherlands will become a supraplanetary entity. To see how, you need to read for yourself.


“Supposing you did drain the oceans, and dumped the water on top of the Curiosity rover, how would Mars change as the water accumulated?”
Again, the answer is clear — it’s a future that will be Netherlands-shaped:
—————————————
“What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?”
Brief answer: “NEARLY EVERYONE WOULD DIE. Then things would get interesting.”—————————————
 “What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?”
Answer: “Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.”
—————————————
 “How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?”

“Therefore, if you drove a car over a Philadelphia speed bump at 90 percent of the speed of light, in addition to destroying the city ... you could expect a speeding ticket of $1.14 billion.”———————————
 “How much Force power can Yoda output?”
“I’m going to—of course—ignore the prequels.”
After a fair share of assumptions and equations, it’s blatantly obvious that Yoda is a much better power source than Luke Skywalker. But a word of caution before we change our power grid to Yoda-based: “So Yoda sounds like our best bet as an energy source. But with world electricity consumption pushing 2 terawatts, it would take a hundred million Yodas to meet our demands. All things considered, switching to Yoda power probably isn’t worth the trouble—though it would definitely be green.”5 stars. If I’m ever shipwrecked on a remote island, I hope to have this book with me — maybe somewhere in its depths there’s a calculation of how long I can last before resorting to cannibalism."
187,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seen:""Do not try any of this at home.

The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting, directly or indirectly, from information contained in this book.""That disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science: Dangerous ideas ahead, folks! Don't get too close -- these things could kill ya!Randall Munroe used to work at NASA, and now he creates the webcomic XKCD (which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig). On his website, he takes ""absurd hypothetical questions"" from readers and tries to answer some of them. Here are some of my favorite questions in this book:What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source would go out?How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?Which US state is actually flown over the most?Is there enough energy to move the entire current human population off-planet?How high can a human throw something?How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?When, if ever, will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean? How would the Earth change as the water was being drained?How many Lego bricks would it take to build a bridge capable of carrying traffic from London to New York? Have that many Lego bricks been manufactured?What would happen to the Earth if the Sun suddenly switched off?If you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions, this book is for you! What made this so much fun, aside from the ridiculous questions, is Munroe's sense of humor. Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers, which is not something that usually happens when I'm reading about science. Oh, and be sure to read his footnotes, which have even more jokes.I think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works. I think I would have loved it when I was 10. *I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book, because I had never heard of the author before. It's the miracle of Goodreads! "
188,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"Mr Munroe includes some “weird and worrying” questions from his website’s inbox which he presents without attempting to answer – one favourite was:If you saved a whole life’s worth of kissing and used all that suction power on one single kiss, how much suction force would that single kiss have?I guess the answer might be “what pharmaceutical products have you ingested during the last four hours?” or “May I speak to your parents?”Another person named Jon Merrill askedHow fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Answer has to be “as fast as I will be running if I ever meet you Jon”.And a person called Kenneth askedWhat if every day, every human had a 1 per cent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a one percent chance of being turned into a human?  Randall does not provide a response to that one but I would have said Kenneth, if only life were like that. Wouldn’t it be fabulous?Everybody likes this book and I liked half of it, the other half was so far over my head it might have been a distant Andean condor croaking Sanskrit into a Bluetooth headset. Some of the stuff Randall devotes pages of detailed analysis to did not tickle my ivories, likeWhat would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power were turned on and put into an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? I mean, get a life. Who the flook cares about a hair dryer in a box? But many are very interesting. He tackles the old chestnutWhat would happen of everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same time?  He picks Rhode Island (it’s just big enough for everyone on Earth, surprisingly) as a designated place where this event might be staged, and imagines the result. In regard to the jump and the landing itself, not so much would result. But then he imagines the implications of all those people trying to get back home from Rhode Island. It’s terrible – it’s an apocalypse. If this mass jumping event was actually staged it would cause the immediate termination of civilisation and the death of billions. The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Yes it is a nice book but I do not recommend that you wolf down this book as I did in 2 days, because it’s like TOO MUCH and it can get annoying. You keep thinking of your own absurd questions – How many soldier ants would it take to chew through my leg in one hour? And would I survive? And really, there is one question which I really want to ask Randall, it’s actually been something I have been wondering about for a long time – you know those vending machines stuffed full of really unhealthy chocs and crisps and cokes? Well, imagine a person was chained to one of those and had an infinite amount of small change within arms reach. Then imagine the vending machine gets refilled by the usual contractor in the usual way (who never notices the chained person). So : how long would it take the captive to die from a constant diet of crap? If they were only eating chocs and crisps and drinking cokes? A month? Six months? A YEAR?? It’s really bugging me. I may have to launch a practical experiment. "

But hey, why the heck not? Right? XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famous.The book comes from his ""what if"" blog, which is also very good.I took the book into work with me to show it around - you know - hipster-esque and what not. I'm reading this trendy, new book first.But the guys at my table were all like, ""Yeah... I can see myself reading like 2 or 3 of these and then putting the book down..."" Everyone more or less nodded in agreement - even though they thought the book was cool.Then I looked at the book a little bit more closely, flipped through a little bit and thought, ""Huh... that sounds about right. That's probably what I'm going to do...""I'll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions... This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly. You know: ""But what if Hitler hadn't killed the Jews? Would you like him then?"" or ""What if Martin Luther King Jr. had used violence? You have to admit, it's pretty crazy that we've given this guy a holiday, right?"" He has a point.So, I took the book home - slightly shamed that I hadn't realized it was more for coffee tables than actual reading.But then I picked it up and read a couple. And a couple more. Next thing I know, a couple of days later the book is done - and I really enjoyed it. ...And I learned a lot. Well presumably.I did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroe's math. Or any of his conclusions. I mean, if I did on a couple of these, there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right? If I could take issue with a couple... I am NOT a math guy.In case there aren't any flame wars yet, let me start one: On page 114 in answer to the question, ""If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks, wouldn't the common cold be wiped out?"" he says, ""The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit. These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses. After a few days, your immune system notices and destroys it, but not before you infect, on average, one other person."" Then he has a footnote which reads, ""Mathematically, this must be true. If the average were less than one, the virus would die out. If it were more than one, eventually everyone would have a cold all the time. But that can't be right? Can it? It's tough to tell whether he's serious or not, because sometimes the footnotes are jokes, and other times they're not.But here, it made me question the math of the rest of the book. He's very meticulous in his calculations throughout, but here he doesn't factor in seasons, or how vast the globe is... Wouldn't it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection - and then people stay away from us - and are more cautious in general - which is why the number goes back down but doesn't die out completely?It took me a while to get over this, undermining the whole book for a couple seconds. Seriously, if he had just said ""but not before you infect, on average, on other person."" I wouldn't have thought twice about it.Of course, I doubted him on other footnotes: pg 134 ""Although it'sa little different, if you drip superglue on cotton thread, it will catch fire."" That can't be right can it? That's another of his jokes? Right?Munroe also interspersed ""Weird (and worrying) questions from the what if? inbox. ...Honestly, most of these weren't any weirder than the questions he was already answering. And sometimes I think they only seemed weird, but I think he may have missed the trail.Like on page 236, the question is, ""What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it won't hit anything vital and I'll live?""There's a stick figure that says ...""Asking for a friend... former friend, I mean.""But I think it's a legitimate question. And I'm pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM. - wasn't it a major plot point? So, Thomas, (the person who asked the question) wherever you are - I don't think you're a weirdo. (...Yeah, yeah, yeah... spoiler alert, if you're reading this in 1996... Although, I'd be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time, it's Munroe. He's sure studying that stuff. And Einstein. And Schrodinger. Also, probably J. Robert Oppenheimer.) And the book is so dated. He mentions the ""new-fangled writing section"" of the SAT on page 278. That was dropped way back in 2016. - Time travelling - am I right?Finally, Munroe - if you're reading this - and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already. You may hate it, but don't knock it till you've tried it, right?Seriously - loved the book. Thought I would like it, didn't think I would love it. Didn't think I would read it the whole way through - finished it in under 3 days....Also, shouldn't this go under like... a sci-fi shelf? Since the questions are hypothetical... Isn't this exactly what science-fiction is? It's just not told in narrative form in this case?"

At any rate, let’s see …Random time in the interval 45 minutes to 75 minutes: 53:51I’d better turn off the baseball game. Right.Okay, the clock is started,Author Randall Munroe writes the on-line comic strip xkcd. (See example above.)https://xkcd.com/On the site, it’s billed as A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. There’s a lot of casual references to computer stuff too. Munroe used to work at NASA as a physicist (I think), then decided to do this other gig. The gags he draws range from single frame, to three frames, to multiple frames extended down your computer screen – sometimes with rafts of text in table form, or anything else that he thinks appropriate for the laugh he’s aiming at.A couple hints for looking at xkcd.1) The humans are always drawn as stick figures. Their gender is shown by types of hairdos on the females. In the strip above, the sociologist, chemist, and mathematician are girls. Obviously.2) By hovering your mouse over the picture (not clicking) a “bonus punch line” (my phrase) will appear. (That won't happen with the cartoon above.)44:03the bookThe secondary title is SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS to Absurd Hypothetical Questions.There might be about 60 of the Question/ANSWER articles in the book. (No time to count them.) Interspersed with these are a dozen single page pieces called “Weird (and Worrying) Questions from the What If? Inbox”. Each page has a couple questions, with no response by the author, except for sometimes a cartoon drawing, a stick figure saying something. etc.Here’s a quite worrying example, #6Q. What is the total nutritional value (calories, fat, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of the average human body? – Justin RisnerQ. What temperature would a chainsaw (or other cutting implement) need to be at to instantly cauterize any injuries inflicted with it? – Sylvia Gallaher(These are probably the worst in the book.) One of these that I wished he had answered was this one.Q. What if every day, every human had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a turkey, and every turkey had a 1 percent chance of being turned into a human? - KennethThe main entries are 3-5 pages long, mostly text, some cartoons accompanying. It’s often hard to anticipate where Munroe will go with a question.One item is called No More DNA. The question is, “This may be a bit gruesome, but … if someone’s DNA suddenly vanished, how long would that person last?”Munroe notes that the average person would be about a third of a pound lighter, then gives a list of several ways that one can lose that amount of weight easier [more safely too!] – such as peeing. When he gets to seriously addressing the question, he says, “To get an idea of what it might be like, lets turn to mushroom poisonings.” Specifically – the Amanita bisporigera. The several related species (from America and Europe) are called by the name destroying angel. These mushrooms contain amatoxin, which binds to an enzyme that is used to read information from DNA. “It hobbles the enzyme, effectively interrupting the process by which cells follow DNA’s instructions.” The amatoxin causes irreversible damage to whatever cells it collects in, in its case, the liver and kidney. There is a walking ghost phase of Amanita poisoning, where the person seems to get better – but their cells are accumulating irreversible and lethal damage. Munroe says this is probably similar to what might happen in the case of the absurd question being answered.Other examples of DNA damage he talks about are from radiation and chemotherapy.I was appropriately horrified by this piece, but I learned about a mushroom I’d never known of, that apparently can be found in the area I live in. SO I now know what it looks like, having searched it out. (Not that I eat wild mushrooms.)Most of the questions are not this disturbing, though they are equally absurd.How long could a nuclear submarine last in orbit?What if everyone actually had only one soul mate, a random person somewhere in the world?How much space does the physical internet take up?If you call a random phone number and say “God bless you,” what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed?The book is like a box of assorted chocolates. You can never tell what you’ll find inside one. It might be scary, it might be funny; it might be just plain fascinating, you might learn something really strange. You very well might want to read parts of it to your partner (share the candy). Any or all, as well as other flavors not mentioned.But the best thing about this book is to just leave it around. Pick it up and flip to a page when you have guests. Or pick it up when you have nothing better to do, and eat one of the candies again!

So this is the book for those readers who are tired of the science question and answer compendiums full of ""Why is the sky blue?"". I adored it and I want more. "
196,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,4,"I don't think I've ever laughed this much and hard from a science or non-fiction book-wait, I take that back, I haven't laughed this much from a book period. I mean periodic tables and radioactive decay doesn't normally warrant laughter-well at least when I read about it. The questions being presented is stuff that would have never crossed my mind, but the instant I read them I was like -oh wow-what the funk if that really happened? I loved the illustrations throughout- and how the scientific info was made into such a fun, yet informative read. For sure checking out more stuff by Munroe."
197,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,3,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionWhat if is a non-fiction book that -as the name implies- gives answer to some absurd hypothetical questions. The book was fun to read until at some points it wasn’t. The author is apparently a genius, I don’t know how can he think in that way. And the dedication and time that he puts to answer these questions is amazing.I imagine the author as that student who used to sit at the front seat and answer all the questions enthusiastically.My problem was that not all the questions were simple and even if they were or if he answered them simply, he would go and make it more and more complicated until I lost interest. Still an entertaining book, specially for the science nerds!"

Well, kind of. A long time ago, I bought a Kindle Fire. If you have bought a kindle Fire, then you know that Amazon fills the box with little 'tutorials'. *cough* ads in a pretty package*cough* Anyway, What If was on the pamphlet of books to read. It looked at it and thought interesting. I later read a book called 'Know it all', a book that asked and answered scientific questions. I loved it and wanted more. So I got this. It is sooo fascinating. It is full of questions that are logical yet so hard to answer. It had so many things I had been wondering myself! This is most certainly going on my Favorite shelf!| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram"
199,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"This book was equal parts hilarious and utter nightmare fuel. I have never had such an emotionally confusing reading experience. One second, snorting my drink up my nose from laughter, the next trying to shove down the sudden and complete terror I'm experiencing because I've been forced to imagine trying to survive in six atmospheres of pressure brought upon by an expanding Earth, or collapsing into a pile of human goo because I've lost my DNA, and doing so has reminded me of my mortality and oh there goes a panic attack WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE OF LIGHTNING AND RADIATION POISONING AND THEN GET EATEN BY CATS. Unlikely potential experiences, to be sure, but that's why you don't give someone like me a book like this. Unlikely experiences are just as easy to imagine and fear irrationally and without control as likely ones, and they only stimulate the bad parts of my imagination. I am now more afraid of a global windstorm brought on by the cessation of the Earth's rotation potentially killing all life on Earth than I am of being murdered or getting a fatal disease.All that is to say, I am most likely not this book's target audience, being a completely ridiculous ball of anxiety over things that nearly 100% will never, ever, ever happen. (I have been reading XKCD since college, though. It is a constant fixture in my life, and is not terrifying.)As a result, it's hard to quantify my experience with this book. So let's add up the points:+5 stars for being so smart and clever and creative-5 stars for answering all the questions where we all die and/or the Earth is destroyed+1 star for including the weird and worrying questions from the inbox that he refused to answer--we should know our limits, people-1 star for being entirely too preoccupied with questions that involve danger+1 star for my favorite question in the book, the one about calling random people on the telephone and saying ""God Bless You,"" hoping to get someone who's just sneezed-1 star for not having more ridiculous questions like that instead of ones where all your blood is drawn out of your finger by a ridiculously high density bullet, forming a giant blood bubble around said bullet and killing you-1000 stars for me waiting the entire fucking book for the question involving the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlacc pit. This question does not exist. I have been lied to.+999 stars for the extremely obscure Kyp Durron reference that only 1 out of every 100,000 people will get (or some other number that hasn't been pulled out of my ass)+1 star for every other Star Wars reference, all of which were clever and relevant+1 star for the funny illustrations+1 star for the recurring joke about the Netherlands (and the way he incorporates things like that into all his answers)-1 star for not including in the Human Computer chapter the obvious potential scenario that the little girl was trying to lasso the cat, and the vase was knocked over in the confusion +1 star for SCIENCE!!-1 star for MATH :(+1 stars for ending the book on a happy note, ""Sometimes it's nice not to destroy the world for a change.""+1 star because the stars I ended up with didn't seem like enoughYou can do the math for yourselves. Or, you know, look up at my star rating there."
200,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori,5,This is a lot of fun from a guy who likes when things catch fire. A lot of the questions reminded me of the ones Neil Gaiman fielded after Geoff Coffey's tweet that he would donate $1 to @EFF for every person who asks @neilhimself how they can watch American Gods in their country.
201,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Randall Munroe is a dangerous guy. Seriously dangerous. He is the author of the online comic strip xkcd. It's about math, science, hacking, logic, and a host of wonderfully nerdy subjects. But in this book, Munroe answers a stack of absurd hypothetical questions. Some of the questions are really crazy, like ""What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?"" Munroe explains that the ""thud"" as everyone came down at the same time wouldn't amount to much. But, the aftermath would be catastrophic.But what's really crazy, is how Munroe takes bland questions and hypes them into incredible zingers. For example, ""If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?"" The answer, of course, is ""no"". But Munroe never stops with an answer like that. He ups the ante, increasing the power of the laser pointers, to the point where he becomes really dangerous!What is truly wonderful about this book, is that the answers are explained with scientific reasoning. Occasionally the answers are speculative, but this is clearly spelled out. Munroe usually applies scientific principles to answer the questions correctly, regardless of the level of absurdity. And, the questions and answers are all illustrated with his stick-figure cartoons, adding appreciably to the humor."
202,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"Q. What if _____?A. Nearly Everyone Would Die!- Randall Munroe, What If? There are certain things on this planet that you seemed to do fine without, but as soon as you discover, you can't now do without. Diet Dr. Pepper, David Foster Wallace, dark chocolate covered cherries all fit into this category. So, too, does Randall Munroe. He seems to occupy a space near, but not on, that vacated by Gary Larson when the great Gary Larson stopped drawing the Far Side (January 1, 1995). If you are unimpressed by Gary Larsen or the Far Side or do not know who he is or what I'm talking about, hell man, read no further. This book is not for you. I'm not trying to suggest that Gary Larson and Randall Munroe occupy the same ground. They are very different. Their approach to science is different. Their technique. However, the Venn Diagram of those readers of Gary Larson 20+ years ago would closely resemble those readers of Randall Munroe's xkcd. Nerds. They are both worshiped by nerds. They are nerd gods. In this godhead of scientific nerd entertainers also exists Bill Nye. Anyway, these are binary science artists. You either get them and love them or you don't. If you don't, well congrats, I really hope someday you will recognized what you did to our beautiful world by voting for Trump. Bastard. Anyway, this book. This book is filled with drawings and explanations by Randall Munroe on topics as diverse as:""Q. What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?""""Q. What would happen if you were to gather a mole (unit of measurement) of moles (the small furry critter) in one place?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How much Force power can Yoda output?""""Q. How high can a human throw something?""Here is the magic of this book, and why it is relevant and important. It is the essentials of science. Science is always jumping into absurd places asking weird questions. Monroe capture the joy of this experience and he integrates the reader into it. He is a translator (like most scientists are) of complex methods into a narrative of explanation. He just takes several absurd, but still logical steps further. I find his book about one standard deviation better than similar attempts at similar things. I'm thinking of Leyner's books: Why Do Men Have Nipples?: Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour. Both are using humor and science and the strategy of funky questions. There are a couple differences, that matter. Mark Leyner isn't a scientist. He's a soft postmodernist author that is playing doctor explaining awkward questons. Monroe is a scientist that is using the scientific method and humor to explain absurd, and sometimes practically nonsense questions. While both of these books can be considered humor books, I tend to favor the one written by a scientist who can draw (kinda) dinosaurs and a pyramid of giraffes. Personal preference I guess. Anyway, if you or anyone in your family is a nerd, or raising a nerd, and enjoy absurdity and funky questions, well, this is almost a perfect book. If not, go ahead and try and to convince me that your vote for Trump isn't going to be considered the beginning of the end of our civilization. You have no soul. "
203,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Update: He published a lot more that aren't in this book. Read them for free here:http://what-if.xkcd.com/archive/So... I love xkcd & some of these questions were really interesting - funny on the face with some really interesting science & math backing up the answer. For instance, the bullet being hit by lightning got into quite a few interesting facts about lightning. Who wouldn't want to know if a machine gun jet pack would work including discussions on caliber, barrel burn out, & fire rates? Cooking a steak via a high altitude drop wasn't nearly as crazy as a mole of moles, but they would make an interesting planetoid. I never would have thought of that on my own. This isn't a book to just sit down & read. The questions & answers often require contemplation. Yoda powered houses probably won't catch on, but discovering just what his maximum power output was when he picked Luke's X-wing out of the swamp got into equations about power & how many Yodas it would take to power our civilization. Sure, I learned them in 9th grade physics, but the refresher was a whole lot more interesting than Ms. Hummel's class ever was. (Sorry, Ms. Hummel. Your class was interesting & figuring out horsepower by running up a flight of stairs was great, but... well... Yoda. Yes, I know your class was long before even the first Star Wars movie, but... Yoda-power. How green can you get?)And then there are the Weird & Worrying Questions sections that dotted this odd amalgamation. Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee? is fairly horrifying, but whatever turns you on. Is it possible to cry so much you dehydrate yourself? is sad, but they're still pure entertainment for me. If I were Munroe & had to worry about the people sending those emails, I might well disconnect from society & move to the middle of northern Alberta, Canada. You think I exaggerate? How many houses are burned down in the United States every year? What would be the easiest way to increase that number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)? How fast would a human have to run in order to be cut in half at the bellybutton by a cheese-cutting wire? Eeek! There are some scary people out there!Highly recommended in small doses!"

I sure know how to live it up. OK, OK... Part of that is untrue - I didn't dump my boyfriend for not knowing what XKCD is. He's put up with some crazy kinds of shit from me, I GUESS I can accept this from him. *sigh* I couldn't resist reading part of this out loud to him, though. But to my dismay, I don't think that he fully appreciated the genius of it, but well... some people are colorblind. Life is sometimes cruel like that. Anyway, this book was great. I've been a fan of XKCD for a long time now, and even if this book was crap, I'd have happily purchased a copy just to support Randall Munroe for my previous webcomic enjoyment. But this book was not crap. It was great. Interesting question content, well-thought out and researched answers, just the right mixture of humor to balance out the brain 'splody math stuff... I loved it. I'm going to give this book three awards: First, for best comedic use of [citation needed]. Second, for best usage of footnote text EVAR. (Really, I couldn't imagine reading this in ebook format - the footnotes made me giggle so frequently that if they were a pain in the tushie to read on an ebook, so much greatness would be missed.)Finally, for best travelogue.

What If?, or Serendipity; or the Literary/Pop Culture Quotes Quiz
Late at night, about a week ago, I went through the Top Quotes pages of Goodreads. A hundred pages, each with thirty quotes: that's 3000 quotes. I have problems. I was searching for quotes that included (on the most part, primarily consisted of) a line in the form of 'If A, B' (let's call it an If quote, or IQ) - I'd compiled them because I had a certain idea for a review where I would use them.What's the catch? The idea was for the review of another book - not What If?. But the day after the nighttime scavenging, I decided against using it because my sense of reviewing aesthetics decided to go with another idea. The result was that I had all these IQ's sitting in a file on my desktop, but they were left completely untouched because I didn't plan to use them any more, while regretting how I should have thought about it more before compiling them in the first place.Fast forward a week, and today I finished Munroe's book. I hadn't really thought about reviewing it (immediately, anyway), but tonight I glanced at the book the review of which the IQ's were meant for on my desk, and it hit me.What If? questions. If... quotes. So I'm able to use my dear IQ's for a review after all. Ladies and gentlemen, that's serendipity for you.From the 3000 quotes, there were a surprising amount of IQ's. I'd estimate there were 60 or so quotes including an If... line (citation needed), of which I had copied 45 of into my file for their quality and validity of use in my review for that other book. I'd like to make it 50 for a nicer number but no artificial perfectionism here - science needs integrity.Here's how the IQ's fit into this review:1. I give you the first half of each IQ (the If A).2. You'll also be given the author of the quote.3. Your task is to see how many of the B's you can fill out. The answers are hidden under the spoiler tags. Better leave peeking at the answer for after you've answered a series by the same author since they might be a giveaway.4. Write your test score /45 in the comments section (give me some love, joy and social validation). For the answers, if they are relatively close you can give yourself the mark.5. Cheaters, if found, will be reported to the Internet Police.Got your pen and paper? Your writing time starts...now.1.

Update:
 This is my first experience in reading a book in paper-copy and having it actually change how much I enjoyed it. A friend who knows me all too well gave me the hardcover version of What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions as a birthday present- and reading it as an ebook just didn't do it justice. The laugh-factor jumped by several orders of magnitude! So here's to Randal Munroe, XKCD and keeping physical books alive!The brain behind 

xkcd

, 

Randall Munroe

, has been churning out even more than his nerdy and hilarious stick-figure comics. This wunderkind also answers to imaginative queries submitted by us lay-folk in 

What if?

, a sort of xkcd sub-blog. So, yes, this is a book-ified blog, which isn't always a bad thing. I actually hadn't really followed the blog prior to reading the book, and was surprised by the balance Munroe is able to strike to make his answers both “scientific” and accessible. Any curious kid could enjoy the book, and the same goes for adults (though if you're hoping for rigorous calculations you will be disappointed).  The weird thing about hypothetical questions, though, is that depending on your audience, sometimes the answer you'll get is ‘Who cares?’ And, for whatever reason, my interest arbitrarily waxed and waned. For example: - Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward firing machine guns? Fascinating! Do tell...

- What would happen if a hair dryer with continuous power was turned on and put in an airtight 1x1x1 meter box? Better question: Why would you ever want to know that?

I found easily three-quarters of the questions interesting, so I won't dock serious points for that, and that wouldn't be problematic if I were more of a browser-type reader.  Of course, extra love added for a veritable rolling mental montage of 
Archer
 tie-ins. The 
Weightless Arrow
 question (something to the effect of: would the friction of air eventually stop an arrow in a zero-gravity environment?) could be easily answered by my favorite world's greatest secret agent.

Munroe has recently announced that he will follow this success with a sequel, How To; and this leads us naturally to consider whether this will turn into a trilogy. If so, we can already begin to predict how the last installment will be named.If we assume that the title will, like its predecessors, consist of two words, the range of possibilities is quite large. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that the total number of unique two-word combinations in English is over 29 billion. If we then make the assumption that one of these words has to be a question word (who, what, where…) then the list is still massive—well over one million. We can further restrict possibilities: first, to short words (one or two syllables); and, second, to idiomatic English expressions. Unfortunately, the list is still quite long. Instead of calculating exactly how long, however, I will make some concrete guesses as to which titles I think are most promising.Why Not?: Carefree Acquiescence to Very Bad SuggestionsQ: Want to go swimming and then climb that telephone pole?A: Hmmm. Okay, why not?What Now?: Misheard Statements by the Partially DeafQ: I think we’re having moussaka for dinner.A: Did you just say Mustafa foreigner?Why Me?: Self-pitying Laments by the Emotionally ImmatureQ: I can’t believe that Annie cheated on me with Brian!

Well, first you take the second right up ahead. Keep going for about five minutes until you see a big blue sign. Don’t turn there, but turn left two intersections after that. Then you’ll hit a roundabout. Keep straight going until you see a sign for exit 31. Make sure you’re in the right lane before that. Now, this is the tricky part after you take the exit, you’re going to have to reenter the highway going the other direction… What About?: Evasive Answers for Harried PoliticiansQ: Is it true that you that you were briefly a member of the KKK?A: I don’t see why everyone is so focused on this.

This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"". Honestly I haven't seen so much useless information gathered together ever before. The extra star goes for the author's occasionally witty sense of humor."

Some of the science was way more complex than expected and I got a little lost. There were some really interesting ""What ifs?"", though, and the book gave me lots of new random trivia to share.Also, unless I was just reading a weird version that omitted it, I was disappointed that the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlac Pit (from the cover) was not in the book."
218,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"Somehow I’ve expected it to be better. I liked many things but I'm still a bit disappointed. The main problem is probably that most of the questions (or more like the answers to them) concerned astrophysics and generally advanced physics. These are definitely areas of knowledge that interest me least. Problems in probability or biology were much more interesting to me.Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about astrophysics and they all seemed quite similar to me. Therefore, the whole book seems a bit monotonous to me. It could use a greater variety of questions - from biology, chemistry, advanced mathematics, maybe even history (questions like what would happen if it happened otherwise). Maybe some questions closer to the humanities or social sciences. But the author sticks to everything that can be measured and counted quite precisely.I'm also a bit disappointed with the questions themselves. I expected them to be really crazy. Just look at the cover - a dinosaur thrown into what looks like a black hole in the desert from which some tentacles stick out. It promises to be great! And the subtitle ""Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions"". Well, these questions are not that weird or absurd. At least for a layman. Or maybe I just don't think about shooting a neutron bomb to Earth on a daily basis. I expected exactly what in the title, bizarre questions that will be of interest to me and to which I will get a professional answer. And that's why I'm a little disappointed.After some time, all the questions and answers merged into one and became a little boring. I even started skipping paragraphs in after the next astrophysics question.Also, I have the impression that the questions in the joke sections did not differ much from those to which the author was looking for answers. Maybe except that they were more interesting, sometimes macabre but usually more interesting. It is a pity that the author did not try to answer even briefly on them.This is not a bad book but more intended for people who are interested in physics. It also seems to me that sometimes I simply lacked a lot of knowledge to fully understand the answer to a question. I have already read similar books and some of them were more interesting. I'm afraid I didn't get as much knowledge from this as I did from them. The questions were too uninteresting and the answers too complicated."

The magic faded drastically after very interesting answers in the beginning.Favorites were :*What would happen if you hit a baseball pitched at 90% speed of light?*Would the Moon change colour if every person aimed a laser pointer at it simultaneously? [We had a real crazy discussion  for this in a group!]*What would happen if real cube shaped Elements bricks are placed at respective position in a Periodic table?*If every human disappeared, which would be the last artificial light source to go out?Some of the comic strips were really hilarious!"
220,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35465603-natalia-de-lune,5," Randall Munroe is brilliant. I know he would disagree with me on this matter. Randall considers himself a simple cartoonist/former NASA roboticist ( just think how cool his curriculum must be),but I have been following his work for long enough to be convinced that he is anything other than brilliant. And I don’t use this term loosely. I’m not talking about his physics knowledge in particular, but mostly about his ability to pass the knowledge forward. It’s easy to understand, and it’s entertaining. I was enthralled to find out he wrote a book, and as the professional lazy person I’m proud to be, I’m only reviewing this now. Anyway, I finally got my lazy ass to finish reading, and it’s exactly what I was expecting: It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s brilliant. I’ve laughed out loud more times than I cared to count,specially at the “Weird and Worrying questions”. I’ve chosen a few of my favorite ones:•	What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? •	 Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee?•	What if everyone actually had only one soul mate,a random person somewhere on the world?•	What if you strapped C4 to a boomerang?

222,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,4,"Randall Patrick Munroe is many things; a former NASA roboticist, the mind behind the scientifically corky and totally hilarious xkcd comic, and the author of What if? In What if? Munroe uses drawings (same as in xkcd), math, some engineering-know-how and tons of logical reasoning to answer outlandish but intriguing questions, all proving that science can be fun and that learning how to think critically is a skill we all need (and must develop). I’m a scientist and I like anything and everything that helps others discover how incredibly entertaining thinking critically and using science can be, so I enjoyed this book enormously. Bonus points, you can read a question at a time just before going to bed as a way to give your brain something to chew on that’s not the present state of the world, but you can also read a bunch of the questions all at once for a more immersive experience. What the heck, you can even have this book near the toilet and read a question each time you’re there. I guarantee you, after a week of that, you won’t even care about bringing your phone along to play candy crush or plants vs zombies or whatever else you’ve been doing there with your phone. As I read the book, I discovered that my favorites questions all seemed to have something in common: they reminded me of instances where Hollywood movies use deux-ex-machina-not scientific-at-all solutions for their plot problems. Think Superman (1978) and the infamous scene when the aforementioned superhero flights around the Earth until it stops it and turns its rotation, and somehow time as well, back. Well the very first question in the book deals with that: What would happen of the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? And it does a fantastic job at showing that Superman would have killed us all gaining absolutely nothing from his misdirected efforts.Munroe’s writing is as witty as it is serious and that works just well in the context of this book and the way it is organize.A solid four star, and a good book to have around to keep your mind entertained and in top shape."

229,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,5,"I firmly believe that that the key to making science accessible to the public at large is to make it FUN. Yes, it also needs to be written at a layman’s level in easily understandable language. But to REACH a large proportion of people, it needs to be interesting and engaging. Humor helps with that a lot. Randall Munroe, a former NASA roboticist and creator of the web comic “xkcd,” has a pretty good handle on how to merge all of these elements into a wildly entertaining trip through some basic science principles through the lens of crazy questions posed by his readers on the web page. As the full title of the book states, it’s “serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.” Now I will state that I LOVE this premise. It reminds me of some of the brainstorming techniques that I used to use as a practicing project manager. In a meeting designed to generate ideas, it’s a fun tactic to get the group to spit out the most outlandish scenarios first. By doing so, a good manager can bring a wealth of imagination to the table, and sometimes a group can strike gold with a course of action that might have seemed specious at first.  So in this book, you get questions like these: From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground in the same instant? And perhaps my favorite question: What would happen if you were to gather a mole (the unit of measurement) of moles (the small, furry critter) in one place? So author Munroe sets about to answering these absurd hypothetical questions, always with gentle humor and always illustrated with his signature stick figure drawings. He patiently wades through some TRULY wild questions with solid science and explanations that anyone with at least a basic understanding of science and math can easily understand. It’s a quick read and tons of fun. 51% of the material is brand new to this book, which means that…..anyone? Anyone? Bueller? …….49% of the material has already appeared on the “xkcd” web page. That probably makes it a worthwhile read even if you are a regular on the website. There are also a TON of interesting footnotes full of in-jokes and sly mirth.  Scientific literacy is in trouble in the USA. There is an urgent need for more rigorous training in basic science and math at EVERY level of the educational system. As such, I will give 5 stars for a book like this that aims to bring science to the masses in an engaging way. In my opinion, science NEEDS to be popularized and celebrated as much as possible. Randall Munroe is doing good work with his web page and this book. Carry on, good sir."
230,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18813588-brian-proffitt,5,"There are times I miss my physics degree.It's not that it went anywhere, mind you, but I have not really used it professionally and it does not come up in my daily life very often. There are exceptions, such as when I try to apply Newton's Third Law to explain politics to my kids: ""For every stupid thing someone says, there will be an equal (if not more) stupid thing said in response.""So when I read ""What If..."", Randall Munroe's collection of his What If? website's (http://what-if.xkcd.com/) more popular articles, there was a bit of melancholy and a tinge of envy. Here, after all, was someone doing really cool things with his physics degree.Then I enjoyed the book so ******* much I did not care.Disclaimer: I am a big Munroe fan (literally, if you'd seen my bathroom scale, you'd know), and read his main XKCD webcomic and What If? sites regularly. So much of this book came as no surprise. What appeals to me about Munroe's works if that while he is a scientist by trade, he seems to have the heart of a poet and satirist. He knows his math and his science, and there is also wit and charm and quite a bit of humor to his art and writing. Some of the humor is dark, but then so are some of the results of the hypothetical questions he gets.This is a book for anyone to read if they have even the most cursory interest in science. And everyone else should read it to get their interest stoked."

232,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,"“What If?” is this in a nutshell: imagine you have a completely random, yet somewhat science-related question. Now imagine that someone who is really smart, really funny, really diligent about research, and really good at explaining complex things in understandable terms takes your question seriously.Randall Munroe is this someone. I am very familiar with his XKCD work, and it’s addictive. The material in this book is also online, so if you’ve perused that webpage, there’s nothing “new” here. Even still, this book is enjoyable, and the writing and layout is pretty good. Obviously, if you’re into science and geeky things, this book is for you. I mean, who doesn’t want to know if you can launch yourself into the air with the power of an AK-47 or why we can’t drop a nuclear bomb into a volcano or hurricane to put a stop to the destructive power of nature (not recommended, by the way)? The best part are those bizarre facts the reader can store away, facts that can be presented in random conversation for no reason, just because you KNOW stuff about stuff.This is NOT a textbook with mundane questions and boring answers to those questions. This is in all actuality a well-thought out book pondering the questions many (unusual) people have, and not really knowing who to turn to for answers. Why not ask the XKCD guy? This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun by inserting them into an exploration of “what would happen if an impossible something” happened, leading to sobering, and often humorous conclusions.One other thing to note about this book: it is perfect to read in “chunks”, that is, reading a chapter or two at a time. Although, be forewarned, once this book is started, it is pretty hard to put down. Highly recommended!"

But it seemed really smart, so, if it seems smart it must = accurate.5/5 for humor. Seriously, most of the articles had me giggling, chuckling, or hysterically laughing at least once. I even dropped the book from cackling so hard. And, I appreciated that. This could have been dry and dull, but Munroe wouldn't allow that. He kept it entertaining and enlightening.5/5 for the questions picked. There are some really interesting questions in here. I wish I thought to ask some of them, but luckily, there are plenty of individuals in this world willing to ask the tough questions, like:""What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?""Or""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source go out?""Or""What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?""Of course, there were some questions too weird and worrisome which Munroe refused to answer, luckily he added them in for our enjoyment.And finally 5/5 for the art/comics Munroe added to coincide with the articles. They helped really bring each answer to laugh, while adding in an additional element to the humor.I cannot recommend this book fast enough if you haven't read it!

236,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am deeply suspicious whenever a book is sold on the basis that its author is in some sense famous, so I was immediately wary of Randall Munroe's What If, especially as the book was plastered with references to his internet science cartoon site xkcd. The press release gets even more excited, proclaiming 'Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer, the genius behind XKCD.com.' Damn him with faint praise, won't you? This isn't helped by the fact that the few times I've seen Munroe's stick cartoons, usually re-spread on social media, I haven't found them at all funny. So it was almost a disappointment when I discovered that I really liked this book.Munro gives detailed answers to weird questions asked from readers on his website. Questions like 'If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change colour?' and 'How much Force power can Yoda output?' There are even some questions that Munroe shakes his head and retreats from - things like 'How many houses are burned down in the US every year? What would be the easiest way to increase the number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)?'The answers given are light hearted, but take the challenge seriously and with some impressive back-of-an-envelope calculation and a touch of research deliver convincing answers. There is a distinguished precedent in taking absurd suggestions (admittedly self-generated) and using them to explore the realities of science in George Gamow's classic (if now rather difficult to read) Mr Tompkins books where, for instance, he explores what would happen if the speed of light reduced to a walking pace.The main problem with Gamow's books is that they suffer from an excess of whimsy, which was considered funny at the time, something that Munroe does occasional succumb to in his footnotes. Two other slight problems with What If are that some of the problems are so silly that it's easy to think 'So what?' and after a while the format gets a bit samey.However, it's hard not to admire the straight faced aplomb with which Munroe deals with weird problem after weird problem - and often takes them so far over the top they become more interesting still. (For instance when asking a question about a hair dryer in a box, he considers the outcome for different powers of hair dryers up to 11 petawatts, which is considerably more than the EU likes to allow for electrical goods. (Sorry, the whimsy is catching.) ) The fact is this is a very likeable and fun book that should entertain many readers."

Munroe creates the hilarious webcomic xkcd, and I guess he also solicits hypothetical questions from readers. This book is a collection of some of his great responses to a series of these questions. For example, when a reader lobs the idea, ""What would happen if the Earth stopped rotating but the air kept moving?"" Munroe gets to the immediate answer (winds at ridiculous speeds, all over the world, all at once), then he goes on delightful explorations, like describing how the damage would happen (maybe X building would be OK from the wind, but it would still get destroyed by windborne debris), theorizing about the fascinating physics that would happen on ocean surfaces, contemplating which cities have enough subterranean architecture to sustain human life for a little while, and eventually ending his essay with a theory of what would get the planet spinning again. The science is backed up by sources at the back of the book (except, comically, when he'll make a claim like ""The ocean is really deep"" and throw in a [citation needed] reference), and adorable cartoons bring in side jokes and illustrate some of the trickier concepts.Some of the best chapters have little to do with science at all. Like, when a reader asks what would happen if everyone in the world jumped in the same place at the same time, the answer is simple (the planet outweighs the weight of humanity by so much that there would be no effect), so the essay gets into the logistical nightmares in the aftermath of billions of people gathering in one place. And there are some funny interstitials with disturbing questions that go unanswered, except by sarcastic one-panel comics.I'm not someone who would spend a lot of time on a book about physics. But I'll spend a lot of time on a humor book. Munroe has someone like me in mind when he writes this book, and I suspect that most readers will love it too."

If so, we can already begin to predict how the last installment will be named.If we assume that the title will, like its predecessors, consist of two words, the range of possibilities is quite large. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that the total number of unique two-word combinations in English is over 29 billion. If we then make the assumption that one of these words has to be a question word (who, what, where…) then the list is still massive—well over one million. We can further restrict possibilities: first, to short words (one or two syllables); and, second, to idiomatic English expressions. Unfortunately, the list is still quite long.

This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"".

Some of the science was way more complex than expected and I got a little lost. There were some really interesting ""What ifs?"", though, and the book gave me lots of new random trivia to share.Also, unless I was just reading a weird version that omitted it, I was disappointed that the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlac Pit (from the cover) was not in the book."
248,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"Somehow I’ve expected it to be better. I liked many things but I'm still a bit disappointed. The main problem is probably that most of the questions (or more like the answers to them) concerned astrophysics and generally advanced physics. These are definitely areas of knowledge that interest me least. Problems in probability or biology were much more interesting to me.Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about astrophysics and they all seemed quite similar to me. Therefore, the whole book seems a bit monotonous to me. It could use a greater variety of questions - from biology, chemistry, advanced mathematics, maybe even history (questions like what would happen if it happened otherwise). Maybe some questions closer to the humanities or social sciences. But the author sticks to everything that can be measured and counted quite precisely.I'm also a bit disappointed with the questions themselves. I expected them to be really crazy. Just look at the cover - a dinosaur thrown into what looks like a black hole in the desert from which some tentacles stick out. It promises to be great! And the subtitle ""Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions"". Well, these questions are not that weird or absurd. At least for a layman. Or maybe I just don't think about shooting a neutron bomb to Earth on a daily basis. I expected exactly what in the title, bizarre questions that will be of interest to me and to which I will get a professional answer. And that's why I'm a little disappointed.After some time, all the questions and answers merged into one and became a little boring. I even started skipping paragraphs in after the next astrophysics question.Also, I have the impression that the questions in the joke sections did not differ much from those to which the author was looking for answers. Maybe except that they were more interesting, sometimes macabre but usually more interesting. It is a pity that the author did not try to answer even briefly on them.This is not a bad book but more intended for people who are interested in physics. It also seems to me that sometimes I simply lacked a lot of knowledge to fully understand the answer to a question. I have already read similar books and some of them were more interesting. I'm afraid I didn't get as much knowledge from this as I did from them. The questions were too uninteresting and the answers too complicated."

The magic faded drastically after very interesting answers in the beginning.Favorites were :*What would happen if you hit a baseball pitched at 90% speed of light?*Would the Moon change colour if every person aimed a laser pointer at it simultaneously? [We had a real crazy discussion  for this in a group!]*What would happen if real cube shaped Elements bricks are placed at respective position in a Periodic table?*If every human disappeared, which would be the last artificial light source to go out?Some of the comic strips were really hilarious!"
250,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35465603-natalia-de-lune,5," Randall Munroe is brilliant. I know he would disagree with me on this matter. Randall considers himself a simple cartoonist/former NASA roboticist ( just think how cool his curriculum must be),but I have been following his work for long enough to be convinced that he is anything other than brilliant. And I don’t use this term loosely. I’m not talking about his physics knowledge in particular, but mostly about his ability to pass the knowledge forward. It’s easy to understand, and it’s entertaining. I was enthralled to find out he wrote a book, and as the professional lazy person I’m proud to be, I’m only reviewing this now. Anyway, I finally got my lazy ass to finish reading, and it’s exactly what I was expecting: It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s brilliant. I’ve laughed out loud more times than I cared to count,specially at the “Weird and Worrying questions”. I’ve chosen a few of my favorite ones:•	What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? •	 Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee?•	What if everyone actually had only one soul mate,a random person somewhere on the world?•	What if you strapped C4 to a boomerang?

252,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,4,"Randall Patrick Munroe is many things; a former NASA roboticist, the mind behind the scientifically corky and totally hilarious xkcd comic, and the author of What if? In What if? Munroe uses drawings (same as in xkcd), math, some engineering-know-how and tons of logical reasoning to answer outlandish but intriguing questions, all proving that science can be fun and that learning how to think critically is a skill we all need (and must develop). I’m a scientist and I like anything and everything that helps others discover how incredibly entertaining thinking critically and using science can be, so I enjoyed this book enormously. Bonus points, you can read a question at a time just before going to bed as a way to give your brain something to chew on that’s not the present state of the world, but you can also read a bunch of the questions all at once for a more immersive experience. What the heck, you can even have this book near the toilet and read a question each time you’re there. I guarantee you, after a week of that, you won’t even care about bringing your phone along to play candy crush or plants vs zombies or whatever else you’ve been doing there with your phone. As I read the book, I discovered that my favorites questions all seemed to have something in common: they reminded me of instances where Hollywood movies use deux-ex-machina-not scientific-at-all solutions for their plot problems. Think Superman (1978) and the infamous scene when the aforementioned superhero flights around the Earth until it stops it and turns its rotation, and somehow time as well, back. Well the very first question in the book deals with that: What would happen of the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? And it does a fantastic job at showing that Superman would have killed us all gaining absolutely nothing from his misdirected efforts.Munroe’s writing is as witty as it is serious and that works just well in the context of this book and the way it is organize.A solid four star, and a good book to have around to keep your mind entertained and in top shape."

259,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,5,"I firmly believe that that the key to making science accessible to the public at large is to make it FUN. Yes, it also needs to be written at a layman’s level in easily understandable language. But to REACH a large proportion of people, it needs to be interesting and engaging. Humor helps with that a lot. Randall Munroe, a former NASA roboticist and creator of the web comic “xkcd,” has a pretty good handle on how to merge all of these elements into a wildly entertaining trip through some basic science principles through the lens of crazy questions posed by his readers on the web page. As the full title of the book states, it’s “serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.” Now I will state that I LOVE this premise. It reminds me of some of the brainstorming techniques that I used to use as a practicing project manager. In a meeting designed to generate ideas, it’s a fun tactic to get the group to spit out the most outlandish scenarios first. By doing so, a good manager can bring a wealth of imagination to the table, and sometimes a group can strike gold with a course of action that might have seemed specious at first.  So in this book, you get questions like these: From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground in the same instant? And perhaps my favorite question: What would happen if you were to gather a mole (the unit of measurement) of moles (the small, furry critter) in one place? So author Munroe sets about to answering these absurd hypothetical questions, always with gentle humor and always illustrated with his signature stick figure drawings. He patiently wades through some TRULY wild questions with solid science and explanations that anyone with at least a basic understanding of science and math can easily understand. It’s a quick read and tons of fun. 51% of the material is brand new to this book, which means that…..anyone? Anyone? Bueller? …….49% of the material has already appeared on the “xkcd” web page. That probably makes it a worthwhile read even if you are a regular on the website. There are also a TON of interesting footnotes full of in-jokes and sly mirth.  Scientific literacy is in trouble in the USA. There is an urgent need for more rigorous training in basic science and math at EVERY level of the educational system. As such, I will give 5 stars for a book like this that aims to bring science to the masses in an engaging way. In my opinion, science NEEDS to be popularized and celebrated as much as possible. Randall Munroe is doing good work with his web page and this book. Carry on, good sir."
260,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18813588-brian-proffitt,5,"There are times I miss my physics degree.It's not that it went anywhere, mind you, but I have not really used it professionally and it does not come up in my daily life very often. There are exceptions, such as when I try to apply Newton's Third Law to explain politics to my kids: ""For every stupid thing someone says, there will be an equal (if not more) stupid thing said in response.""So when I read ""What If..."", Randall Munroe's collection of his What If? website's (http://what-if.xkcd.com/) more popular articles, there was a bit of melancholy and a tinge of envy. Here, after all, was someone doing really cool things with his physics degree.Then I enjoyed the book so ******* much I did not care.Disclaimer: I am a big Munroe fan (literally, if you'd seen my bathroom scale, you'd know), and read his main XKCD webcomic and What If? sites regularly. So much of this book came as no surprise. What appeals to me about Munroe's works if that while he is a scientist by trade, he seems to have the heart of a poet and satirist. He knows his math and his science, and there is also wit and charm and quite a bit of humor to his art and writing. Some of the humor is dark, but then so are some of the results of the hypothetical questions he gets.This is a book for anyone to read if they have even the most cursory interest in science. And everyone else should read it to get their interest stoked."

262,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,"“What If?” is this in a nutshell: imagine you have a completely random, yet somewhat science-related question. Now imagine that someone who is really smart, really funny, really diligent about research, and really good at explaining complex things in understandable terms takes your question seriously.Randall Munroe is this someone. I am very familiar with his XKCD work, and it’s addictive. The material in this book is also online, so if you’ve perused that webpage, there’s nothing “new” here. Even still, this book is enjoyable, and the writing and layout is pretty good. Obviously, if you’re into science and geeky things, this book is for you. I mean, who doesn’t want to know if you can launch yourself into the air with the power of an AK-47 or why we can’t drop a nuclear bomb into a volcano or hurricane to put a stop to the destructive power of nature (not recommended, by the way)? The best part are those bizarre facts the reader can store away, facts that can be presented in random conversation for no reason, just because you KNOW stuff about stuff.This is NOT a textbook with mundane questions and boring answers to those questions. This is in all actuality a well-thought out book pondering the questions many (unusual) people have, and not really knowing who to turn to for answers. Why not ask the XKCD guy? This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun by inserting them into an exploration of “what would happen if an impossible something” happened, leading to sobering, and often humorous conclusions.One other thing to note about this book: it is perfect to read in “chunks”, that is, reading a chapter or two at a time. Although, be forewarned, once this book is started, it is pretty hard to put down. Highly recommended!"

But it seemed really smart, so, if it seems smart it must = accurate.5/5 for humor. Seriously, most of the articles had me giggling, chuckling, or hysterically laughing at least once. I even dropped the book from cackling so hard. And, I appreciated that. This could have been dry and dull, but Munroe wouldn't allow that. He kept it entertaining and enlightening.5/5 for the questions picked. There are some really interesting questions in here. I wish I thought to ask some of them, but luckily, there are plenty of individuals in this world willing to ask the tough questions, like:""What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?""Or""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source go out?""Or""What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?""Of course, there were some questions too weird and worrisome which Munroe refused to answer, luckily he added them in for our enjoyment.And finally 5/5 for the art/comics Munroe added to coincide with the articles. They helped really bring each answer to laugh, while adding in an additional element to the humor.I cannot recommend this book fast enough if you haven't read it!

266,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am deeply suspicious whenever a book is sold on the basis that its author is in some sense famous, so I was immediately wary of Randall Munroe's What If, especially as the book was plastered with references to his internet science cartoon site xkcd. The press release gets even more excited, proclaiming 'Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer, the genius behind XKCD.com.' Damn him with faint praise, won't you? This isn't helped by the fact that the few times I've seen Munroe's stick cartoons, usually re-spread on social media, I haven't found them at all funny. So it was almost a disappointment when I discovered that I really liked this book.Munro gives detailed answers to weird questions asked from readers on his website. Questions like 'If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change colour?' and 'How much Force power can Yoda output?' There are even some questions that Munroe shakes his head and retreats from - things like 'How many houses are burned down in the US every year? What would be the easiest way to increase the number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)?'The answers given are light hearted, but take the challenge seriously and with some impressive back-of-an-envelope calculation and a touch of research deliver convincing answers. There is a distinguished precedent in taking absurd suggestions (admittedly self-generated) and using them to explore the realities of science in George Gamow's classic (if now rather difficult to read) Mr Tompkins books where, for instance, he explores what would happen if the speed of light reduced to a walking pace.The main problem with Gamow's books is that they suffer from an excess of whimsy, which was considered funny at the time, something that Munroe does occasional succumb to in his footnotes. Two other slight problems with What If are that some of the problems are so silly that it's easy to think 'So what?' and after a while the format gets a bit samey.However, it's hard not to admire the straight faced aplomb with which Munroe deals with weird problem after weird problem - and often takes them so far over the top they become more interesting still. (For instance when asking a question about a hair dryer in a box, he considers the outcome for different powers of hair dryers up to 11 petawatts, which is considerably more than the EU likes to allow for electrical goods. (Sorry, the whimsy is catching.) ) The fact is this is a very likeable and fun book that should entertain many readers."

Munroe creates the hilarious webcomic xkcd, and I guess he also solicits hypothetical questions from readers. This book is a collection of some of his great responses to a series of these questions. For example, when a reader lobs the idea, ""What would happen if the Earth stopped rotating but the air kept moving?"" Munroe gets to the immediate answer (winds at ridiculous speeds, all over the world, all at once), then he goes on delightful explorations, like describing how the damage would happen (maybe X building would be OK from the wind, but it would still get destroyed by windborne debris), theorizing about the fascinating physics that would happen on ocean surfaces, contemplating which cities have enough subterranean architecture to sustain human life for a little while, and eventually ending his essay with a theory of what would get the planet spinning again. The science is backed up by sources at the back of the book (except, comically, when he'll make a claim like ""The ocean is really deep"" and throw in a [citation needed] reference), and adorable cartoons bring in side jokes and illustrate some of the trickier concepts.Some of the best chapters have little to do with science at all. Like, when a reader asks what would happen if everyone in the world jumped in the same place at the same time, the answer is simple (the planet outweighs the weight of humanity by so much that there would be no effect), so the essay gets into the logistical nightmares in the aftermath of billions of people gathering in one place. And there are some funny interstitials with disturbing questions that go unanswered, except by sarcastic one-panel comics.I'm not someone who would spend a lot of time on a book about physics. But I'll spend a lot of time on a humor book. Munroe has someone like me in mind when he writes this book, and I suspect that most readers will love it too."

If so, we can already begin to predict how the last installment will be named.If we assume that the title will, like its predecessors, consist of two words, the range of possibilities is quite large. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that the total number of unique two-word combinations in English is over 29 billion. If we then make the assumption that one of these words has to be a question word (who, what, where…) then the list is still massive—well over one million.

This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"".

Some of the science was way more complex than expected and I got a little lost. There were some really interesting ""What ifs?"", though, and the book gave me lots of new random trivia to share.Also, unless I was just reading a weird version that omitted it, I was disappointed that the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlac Pit (from the cover) was not in the book."
278,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"Somehow I’ve expected it to be better. I liked many things but I'm still a bit disappointed. The main problem is probably that most of the questions (or more like the answers to them) concerned astrophysics and generally advanced physics. These are definitely areas of knowledge that interest me least. Problems in probability or biology were much more interesting to me.Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about astrophysics and they all seemed quite similar to me. Therefore, the whole book seems a bit monotonous to me. It could use a greater variety of questions - from biology, chemistry, advanced mathematics, maybe even history (questions like what would happen if it happened otherwise). Maybe some questions closer to the humanities or social sciences. But the author sticks to everything that can be measured and counted quite precisely.I'm also a bit disappointed with the questions themselves. I expected them to be really crazy. Just look at the cover - a dinosaur thrown into what looks like a black hole in the desert from which some tentacles stick out. It promises to be great! And the subtitle ""Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions"". Well, these questions are not that weird or absurd. At least for a layman. Or maybe I just don't think about shooting a neutron bomb to Earth on a daily basis. I expected exactly what in the title, bizarre questions that will be of interest to me and to which I will get a professional answer. And that's why I'm a little disappointed.After some time, all the questions and answers merged into one and became a little boring. I even started skipping paragraphs in after the next astrophysics question.Also, I have the impression that the questions in the joke sections did not differ much from those to which the author was looking for answers. Maybe except that they were more interesting, sometimes macabre but usually more interesting. It is a pity that the author did not try to answer even briefly on them.This is not a bad book but more intended for people who are interested in physics. It also seems to me that sometimes I simply lacked a lot of knowledge to fully understand the answer to a question. I have already read similar books and some of them were more interesting. I'm afraid I didn't get as much knowledge from this as I did from them. The questions were too uninteresting and the answers too complicated."

The magic faded drastically after very interesting answers in the beginning.Favorites were :*What would happen if you hit a baseball pitched at 90% speed of light?*Would the Moon change colour if every person aimed a laser pointer at it simultaneously? [We had a real crazy discussion  for this in a group!]*What would happen if real cube shaped Elements bricks are placed at respective position in a Periodic table?*If every human disappeared, which would be the last artificial light source to go out?Some of the comic strips were really hilarious!"
280,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35465603-natalia-de-lune,5," Randall Munroe is brilliant. I know he would disagree with me on this matter. Randall considers himself a simple cartoonist/former NASA roboticist ( just think how cool his curriculum must be),but I have been following his work for long enough to be convinced that he is anything other than brilliant. And I don’t use this term loosely. I’m not talking about his physics knowledge in particular, but mostly about his ability to pass the knowledge forward. It’s easy to understand, and it’s entertaining. I was enthralled to find out he wrote a book, and as the professional lazy person I’m proud to be, I’m only reviewing this now. Anyway, I finally got my lazy ass to finish reading, and it’s exactly what I was expecting: It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s brilliant. I’ve laughed out loud more times than I cared to count,specially at the “Weird and Worrying questions”. I’ve chosen a few of my favorite ones:•	What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? •	 Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee?•	What if everyone actually had only one soul mate,a random person somewhere on the world?•	What if you strapped C4 to a boomerang?

282,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,4,"Randall Patrick Munroe is many things; a former NASA roboticist, the mind behind the scientifically corky and totally hilarious xkcd comic, and the author of What if? In What if? Munroe uses drawings (same as in xkcd), math, some engineering-know-how and tons of logical reasoning to answer outlandish but intriguing questions, all proving that science can be fun and that learning how to think critically is a skill we all need (and must develop). I’m a scientist and I like anything and everything that helps others discover how incredibly entertaining thinking critically and using science can be, so I enjoyed this book enormously. Bonus points, you can read a question at a time just before going to bed as a way to give your brain something to chew on that’s not the present state of the world, but you can also read a bunch of the questions all at once for a more immersive experience. What the heck, you can even have this book near the toilet and read a question each time you’re there. I guarantee you, after a week of that, you won’t even care about bringing your phone along to play candy crush or plants vs zombies or whatever else you’ve been doing there with your phone. As I read the book, I discovered that my favorites questions all seemed to have something in common: they reminded me of instances where Hollywood movies use deux-ex-machina-not scientific-at-all solutions for their plot problems. Think Superman (1978) and the infamous scene when the aforementioned superhero flights around the Earth until it stops it and turns its rotation, and somehow time as well, back. Well the very first question in the book deals with that: What would happen of the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? And it does a fantastic job at showing that Superman would have killed us all gaining absolutely nothing from his misdirected efforts.Munroe’s writing is as witty as it is serious and that works just well in the context of this book and the way it is organize.A solid four star, and a good book to have around to keep your mind entertained and in top shape."

289,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,5,"I firmly believe that that the key to making science accessible to the public at large is to make it FUN. Yes, it also needs to be written at a layman’s level in easily understandable language. But to REACH a large proportion of people, it needs to be interesting and engaging. Humor helps with that a lot. Randall Munroe, a former NASA roboticist and creator of the web comic “xkcd,” has a pretty good handle on how to merge all of these elements into a wildly entertaining trip through some basic science principles through the lens of crazy questions posed by his readers on the web page. As the full title of the book states, it’s “serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.” Now I will state that I LOVE this premise. It reminds me of some of the brainstorming techniques that I used to use as a practicing project manager. In a meeting designed to generate ideas, it’s a fun tactic to get the group to spit out the most outlandish scenarios first. By doing so, a good manager can bring a wealth of imagination to the table, and sometimes a group can strike gold with a course of action that might have seemed specious at first.  So in this book, you get questions like these: From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground in the same instant? And perhaps my favorite question: What would happen if you were to gather a mole (the unit of measurement) of moles (the small, furry critter) in one place? So author Munroe sets about to answering these absurd hypothetical questions, always with gentle humor and always illustrated with his signature stick figure drawings. He patiently wades through some TRULY wild questions with solid science and explanations that anyone with at least a basic understanding of science and math can easily understand. It’s a quick read and tons of fun. 51% of the material is brand new to this book, which means that…..anyone? Anyone? Bueller? …….49% of the material has already appeared on the “xkcd” web page. That probably makes it a worthwhile read even if you are a regular on the website. There are also a TON of interesting footnotes full of in-jokes and sly mirth.  Scientific literacy is in trouble in the USA. There is an urgent need for more rigorous training in basic science and math at EVERY level of the educational system. As such, I will give 5 stars for a book like this that aims to bring science to the masses in an engaging way. In my opinion, science NEEDS to be popularized and celebrated as much as possible. Randall Munroe is doing good work with his web page and this book. Carry on, good sir."
290,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18813588-brian-proffitt,5,"There are times I miss my physics degree.It's not that it went anywhere, mind you, but I have not really used it professionally and it does not come up in my daily life very often. There are exceptions, such as when I try to apply Newton's Third Law to explain politics to my kids: ""For every stupid thing someone says, there will be an equal (if not more) stupid thing said in response.""So when I read ""What If..."", Randall Munroe's collection of his What If? website's (http://what-if.xkcd.com/) more popular articles, there was a bit of melancholy and a tinge of envy. Here, after all, was someone doing really cool things with his physics degree.Then I enjoyed the book so ******* much I did not care.Disclaimer: I am a big Munroe fan (literally, if you'd seen my bathroom scale, you'd know), and read his main XKCD webcomic and What If? sites regularly. So much of this book came as no surprise. What appeals to me about Munroe's works if that while he is a scientist by trade, he seems to have the heart of a poet and satirist. He knows his math and his science, and there is also wit and charm and quite a bit of humor to his art and writing. Some of the humor is dark, but then so are some of the results of the hypothetical questions he gets.This is a book for anyone to read if they have even the most cursory interest in science. And everyone else should read it to get their interest stoked."

292,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,"“What If?” is this in a nutshell: imagine you have a completely random, yet somewhat science-related question. Now imagine that someone who is really smart, really funny, really diligent about research, and really good at explaining complex things in understandable terms takes your question seriously.Randall Munroe is this someone. I am very familiar with his XKCD work, and it’s addictive. The material in this book is also online, so if you’ve perused that webpage, there’s nothing “new” here. Even still, this book is enjoyable, and the writing and layout is pretty good. Obviously, if you’re into science and geeky things, this book is for you. I mean, who doesn’t want to know if you can launch yourself into the air with the power of an AK-47 or why we can’t drop a nuclear bomb into a volcano or hurricane to put a stop to the destructive power of nature (not recommended, by the way)? The best part are those bizarre facts the reader can store away, facts that can be presented in random conversation for no reason, just because you KNOW stuff about stuff.This is NOT a textbook with mundane questions and boring answers to those questions. This is in all actuality a well-thought out book pondering the questions many (unusual) people have, and not really knowing who to turn to for answers. Why not ask the XKCD guy? This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun by inserting them into an exploration of “what would happen if an impossible something” happened, leading to sobering, and often humorous conclusions.One other thing to note about this book: it is perfect to read in “chunks”, that is, reading a chapter or two at a time. Although, be forewarned, once this book is started, it is pretty hard to put down. Highly recommended!"

But it seemed really smart, so, if it seems smart it must = accurate.5/5 for humor. Seriously, most of the articles had me giggling, chuckling, or hysterically laughing at least once. I even dropped the book from cackling so hard. And, I appreciated that. This could have been dry and dull, but Munroe wouldn't allow that. He kept it entertaining and enlightening.5/5 for the questions picked. There are some really interesting questions in here. I wish I thought to ask some of them, but luckily, there are plenty of individuals in this world willing to ask the tough questions, like:""What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?""Or""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source go out?""Or""What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?""Of course, there were some questions too weird and worrisome which Munroe refused to answer, luckily he added them in for our enjoyment.And finally 5/5 for the art/comics Munroe added to coincide with the articles. They helped really bring each answer to laugh, while adding in an additional element to the humor.I cannot recommend this book fast enough if you haven't read it!

296,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am deeply suspicious whenever a book is sold on the basis that its author is in some sense famous, so I was immediately wary of Randall Munroe's What If, especially as the book was plastered with references to his internet science cartoon site xkcd. The press release gets even more excited, proclaiming 'Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer, the genius behind XKCD.com.' Damn him with faint praise, won't you? This isn't helped by the fact that the few times I've seen Munroe's stick cartoons, usually re-spread on social media, I haven't found them at all funny. So it was almost a disappointment when I discovered that I really liked this book.Munro gives detailed answers to weird questions asked from readers on his website. Questions like 'If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change colour?' and 'How much Force power can Yoda output?' There are even some questions that Munroe shakes his head and retreats from - things like 'How many houses are burned down in the US every year? What would be the easiest way to increase the number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)?'The answers given are light hearted, but take the challenge seriously and with some impressive back-of-an-envelope calculation and a touch of research deliver convincing answers. There is a distinguished precedent in taking absurd suggestions (admittedly self-generated) and using them to explore the realities of science in George Gamow's classic (if now rather difficult to read) Mr Tompkins books where, for instance, he explores what would happen if the speed of light reduced to a walking pace.The main problem with Gamow's books is that they suffer from an excess of whimsy, which was considered funny at the time, something that Munroe does occasional succumb to in his footnotes. Two other slight problems with What If are that some of the problems are so silly that it's easy to think 'So what?' and after a while the format gets a bit samey.However, it's hard not to admire the straight faced aplomb with which Munroe deals with weird problem after weird problem - and often takes them so far over the top they become more interesting still. (For instance when asking a question about a hair dryer in a box, he considers the outcome for different powers of hair dryers up to 11 petawatts, which is considerably more than the EU likes to allow for electrical goods. (Sorry, the whimsy is catching.) ) The fact is this is a very likeable and fun book that should entertain many readers."

Munroe creates the hilarious webcomic xkcd, and I guess he also solicits hypothetical questions from readers. This book is a collection of some of his great responses to a series of these questions. For example, when a reader lobs the idea, ""What would happen if the Earth stopped rotating but the air kept moving?"" Munroe gets to the immediate answer (winds at ridiculous speeds, all over the world, all at once), then he goes on delightful explorations, like describing how the damage would happen (maybe X building would be OK from the wind, but it would still get destroyed by windborne debris), theorizing about the fascinating physics that would happen on ocean surfaces, contemplating which cities have enough subterranean architecture to sustain human life for a little while, and eventually ending his essay with a theory of what would get the planet spinning again. The science is backed up by sources at the back of the book (except, comically, when he'll make a claim like ""The ocean is really deep"" and throw in a [citation needed] reference), and adorable cartoons bring in side jokes and illustrate some of the trickier concepts.Some of the best chapters have little to do with science at all. Like, when a reader asks what would happen if everyone in the world jumped in the same place at the same time, the answer is simple (the planet outweighs the weight of humanity by so much that there would be no effect), so the essay gets into the logistical nightmares in the aftermath of billions of people gathering in one place. And there are some funny interstitials with disturbing questions that go unanswered, except by sarcastic one-panel comics.I'm not someone who would spend a lot of time on a book about physics. But I'll spend a lot of time on a humor book. Munroe has someone like me in mind when he writes this book, and I suspect that most readers will love it too."

If so, we can already begin to predict how the last installment will be named.If we assume that the title will, like its predecessors, consist of two words, the range of possibilities is quite large. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that the total number of unique two-word combinations in English is over 29 billion. If we then make the assumption that one of these words has to be a question word (who, what, where…) then the list is still massive—well over one million.

This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"". Honestly I haven't seen so much useless information gathered together ever before. The extra star goes for the author's occasionally witty sense of humor."

Some of the science was way more complex than expected and I got a little lost. There were some really interesting ""What ifs?"", though, and the book gave me lots of new random trivia to share.Also, unless I was just reading a weird version that omitted it, I was disappointed that the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlac Pit (from the cover) was not in the book."
308,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"Somehow I’ve expected it to be better. I liked many things but I'm still a bit disappointed. The main problem is probably that most of the questions (or more like the answers to them) concerned astrophysics and generally advanced physics. These are definitely areas of knowledge that interest me least. Problems in probability or biology were much more interesting to me.Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about astrophysics and they all seemed quite similar to me. Therefore, the whole book seems a bit monotonous to me. It could use a greater variety of questions - from biology, chemistry, advanced mathematics, maybe even history (questions like what would happen if it happened otherwise). Maybe some questions closer to the humanities or social sciences. But the author sticks to everything that can be measured and counted quite precisely.I'm also a bit disappointed with the questions themselves. I expected them to be really crazy. Just look at the cover - a dinosaur thrown into what looks like a black hole in the desert from which some tentacles stick out. It promises to be great! And the subtitle ""Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions"". Well, these questions are not that weird or absurd. At least for a layman. Or maybe I just don't think about shooting a neutron bomb to Earth on a daily basis. I expected exactly what in the title, bizarre questions that will be of interest to me and to which I will get a professional answer. And that's why I'm a little disappointed.After some time, all the questions and answers merged into one and became a little boring. I even started skipping paragraphs in after the next astrophysics question.Also, I have the impression that the questions in the joke sections did not differ much from those to which the author was looking for answers. Maybe except that they were more interesting, sometimes macabre but usually more interesting. It is a pity that the author did not try to answer even briefly on them.This is not a bad book but more intended for people who are interested in physics. It also seems to me that sometimes I simply lacked a lot of knowledge to fully understand the answer to a question. I have already read similar books and some of them were more interesting. I'm afraid I didn't get as much knowledge from this as I did from them. The questions were too uninteresting and the answers too complicated."

The magic faded drastically after very interesting answers in the beginning.Favorites were :*What would happen if you hit a baseball pitched at 90% speed of light?*Would the Moon change colour if every person aimed a laser pointer at it simultaneously? [We had a real crazy discussion  for this in a group!]*What would happen if real cube shaped Elements bricks are placed at respective position in a Periodic table?*If every human disappeared, which would be the last artificial light source to go out?Some of the comic strips were really hilarious!"
310,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35465603-natalia-de-lune,5," Randall Munroe is brilliant. I know he would disagree with me on this matter. Randall considers himself a simple cartoonist/former NASA roboticist ( just think how cool his curriculum must be),but I have been following his work for long enough to be convinced that he is anything other than brilliant. And I don’t use this term loosely. I’m not talking about his physics knowledge in particular, but mostly about his ability to pass the knowledge forward. It’s easy to understand, and it’s entertaining. I was enthralled to find out he wrote a book, and as the professional lazy person I’m proud to be, I’m only reviewing this now. Anyway, I finally got my lazy ass to finish reading, and it’s exactly what I was expecting: It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s brilliant. I’ve laughed out loud more times than I cared to count,specially at the “Weird and Worrying questions”. I’ve chosen a few of my favorite ones:•	What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? •	 Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee?•	What if everyone actually had only one soul mate,a random person somewhere on the world?•	What if you strapped C4 to a boomerang?

312,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,4,"Randall Patrick Munroe is many things; a former NASA roboticist, the mind behind the scientifically corky and totally hilarious xkcd comic, and the author of What if? In What if? Munroe uses drawings (same as in xkcd), math, some engineering-know-how and tons of logical reasoning to answer outlandish but intriguing questions, all proving that science can be fun and that learning how to think critically is a skill we all need (and must develop). I’m a scientist and I like anything and everything that helps others discover how incredibly entertaining thinking critically and using science can be, so I enjoyed this book enormously. Bonus points, you can read a question at a time just before going to bed as a way to give your brain something to chew on that’s not the present state of the world, but you can also read a bunch of the questions all at once for a more immersive experience. What the heck, you can even have this book near the toilet and read a question each time you’re there. I guarantee you, after a week of that, you won’t even care about bringing your phone along to play candy crush or plants vs zombies or whatever else you’ve been doing there with your phone. As I read the book, I discovered that my favorites questions all seemed to have something in common: they reminded me of instances where Hollywood movies use deux-ex-machina-not scientific-at-all solutions for their plot problems. Think Superman (1978) and the infamous scene when the aforementioned superhero flights around the Earth until it stops it and turns its rotation, and somehow time as well, back. Well the very first question in the book deals with that: What would happen of the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? And it does a fantastic job at showing that Superman would have killed us all gaining absolutely nothing from his misdirected efforts.Munroe’s writing is as witty as it is serious and that works just well in the context of this book and the way it is organize.A solid four star, and a good book to have around to keep your mind entertained and in top shape."

319,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,5,"I firmly believe that that the key to making science accessible to the public at large is to make it FUN. Yes, it also needs to be written at a layman’s level in easily understandable language. But to REACH a large proportion of people, it needs to be interesting and engaging. Humor helps with that a lot. Randall Munroe, a former NASA roboticist and creator of the web comic “xkcd,” has a pretty good handle on how to merge all of these elements into a wildly entertaining trip through some basic science principles through the lens of crazy questions posed by his readers on the web page. As the full title of the book states, it’s “serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.” Now I will state that I LOVE this premise. It reminds me of some of the brainstorming techniques that I used to use as a practicing project manager. In a meeting designed to generate ideas, it’s a fun tactic to get the group to spit out the most outlandish scenarios first. By doing so, a good manager can bring a wealth of imagination to the table, and sometimes a group can strike gold with a course of action that might have seemed specious at first.  So in this book, you get questions like these: From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground in the same instant? And perhaps my favorite question: What would happen if you were to gather a mole (the unit of measurement) of moles (the small, furry critter) in one place? So author Munroe sets about to answering these absurd hypothetical questions, always with gentle humor and always illustrated with his signature stick figure drawings. He patiently wades through some TRULY wild questions with solid science and explanations that anyone with at least a basic understanding of science and math can easily understand. It’s a quick read and tons of fun. 51% of the material is brand new to this book, which means that…..anyone? Anyone? Bueller? …….49% of the material has already appeared on the “xkcd” web page. That probably makes it a worthwhile read even if you are a regular on the website. There are also a TON of interesting footnotes full of in-jokes and sly mirth.  Scientific literacy is in trouble in the USA. There is an urgent need for more rigorous training in basic science and math at EVERY level of the educational system. As such, I will give 5 stars for a book like this that aims to bring science to the masses in an engaging way. In my opinion, science NEEDS to be popularized and celebrated as much as possible. Randall Munroe is doing good work with his web page and this book. Carry on, good sir."
320,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18813588-brian-proffitt,5,"There are times I miss my physics degree.It's not that it went anywhere, mind you, but I have not really used it professionally and it does not come up in my daily life very often. There are exceptions, such as when I try to apply Newton's Third Law to explain politics to my kids: ""For every stupid thing someone says, there will be an equal (if not more) stupid thing said in response.""So when I read ""What If..."", Randall Munroe's collection of his What If? website's (http://what-if.xkcd.com/) more popular articles, there was a bit of melancholy and a tinge of envy. Here, after all, was someone doing really cool things with his physics degree.Then I enjoyed the book so ******* much I did not care.Disclaimer: I am a big Munroe fan (literally, if you'd seen my bathroom scale, you'd know), and read his main XKCD webcomic and What If? sites regularly. So much of this book came as no surprise. What appeals to me about Munroe's works if that while he is a scientist by trade, he seems to have the heart of a poet and satirist. He knows his math and his science, and there is also wit and charm and quite a bit of humor to his art and writing. Some of the humor is dark, but then so are some of the results of the hypothetical questions he gets.This is a book for anyone to read if they have even the most cursory interest in science. And everyone else should read it to get their interest stoked."

322,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,"“What If?” is this in a nutshell: imagine you have a completely random, yet somewhat science-related question. Now imagine that someone who is really smart, really funny, really diligent about research, and really good at explaining complex things in understandable terms takes your question seriously.Randall Munroe is this someone. I am very familiar with his XKCD work, and it’s addictive. The material in this book is also online, so if you’ve perused that webpage, there’s nothing “new” here. Even still, this book is enjoyable, and the writing and layout is pretty good. Obviously, if you’re into science and geeky things, this book is for you. I mean, who doesn’t want to know if you can launch yourself into the air with the power of an AK-47 or why we can’t drop a nuclear bomb into a volcano or hurricane to put a stop to the destructive power of nature (not recommended, by the way)? The best part are those bizarre facts the reader can store away, facts that can be presented in random conversation for no reason, just because you KNOW stuff about stuff.This is NOT a textbook with mundane questions and boring answers to those questions. This is in all actuality a well-thought out book pondering the questions many (unusual) people have, and not really knowing who to turn to for answers. Why not ask the XKCD guy? This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun by inserting them into an exploration of “what would happen if an impossible something” happened, leading to sobering, and often humorous conclusions.One other thing to note about this book: it is perfect to read in “chunks”, that is, reading a chapter or two at a time. Although, be forewarned, once this book is started, it is pretty hard to put down. Highly recommended!"

But it seemed really smart, so, if it seems smart it must = accurate.5/5 for humor. Seriously, most of the articles had me giggling, chuckling, or hysterically laughing at least once. I even dropped the book from cackling so hard. And, I appreciated that. This could have been dry and dull, but Munroe wouldn't allow that. He kept it entertaining and enlightening.5/5 for the questions picked. There are some really interesting questions in here. I wish I thought to ask some of them, but luckily, there are plenty of individuals in this world willing to ask the tough questions, like:""What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?""Or""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source go out?""Or""What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?""Of course, there were some questions too weird and worrisome which Munroe refused to answer, luckily he added them in for our enjoyment.And finally 5/5 for the art/comics Munroe added to coincide with the articles. They helped really bring each answer to laugh, while adding in an additional element to the humor.I cannot recommend this book fast enough if you haven't read it!

326,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am deeply suspicious whenever a book is sold on the basis that its author is in some sense famous, so I was immediately wary of Randall Munroe's What If, especially as the book was plastered with references to his internet science cartoon site xkcd. The press release gets even more excited, proclaiming 'Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer, the genius behind XKCD.com.' Damn him with faint praise, won't you? This isn't helped by the fact that the few times I've seen Munroe's stick cartoons, usually re-spread on social media, I haven't found them at all funny. So it was almost a disappointment when I discovered that I really liked this book.Munro gives detailed answers to weird questions asked from readers on his website. Questions like 'If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change colour?' and 'How much Force power can Yoda output?' There are even some questions that Munroe shakes his head and retreats from - things like 'How many houses are burned down in the US every year? What would be the easiest way to increase the number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)?'The answers given are light hearted, but take the challenge seriously and with some impressive back-of-an-envelope calculation and a touch of research deliver convincing answers. There is a distinguished precedent in taking absurd suggestions (admittedly self-generated) and using them to explore the realities of science in George Gamow's classic (if now rather difficult to read) Mr Tompkins books where, for instance, he explores what would happen if the speed of light reduced to a walking pace.The main problem with Gamow's books is that they suffer from an excess of whimsy, which was considered funny at the time, something that Munroe does occasional succumb to in his footnotes. Two other slight problems with What If are that some of the problems are so silly that it's easy to think 'So what?' and after a while the format gets a bit samey.However, it's hard not to admire the straight faced aplomb with which Munroe deals with weird problem after weird problem - and often takes them so far over the top they become more interesting still. (For instance when asking a question about a hair dryer in a box, he considers the outcome for different powers of hair dryers up to 11 petawatts, which is considerably more than the EU likes to allow for electrical goods. (Sorry, the whimsy is catching.) ) The fact is this is a very likeable and fun book that should entertain many readers."

Munroe creates the hilarious webcomic xkcd, and I guess he also solicits hypothetical questions from readers. This book is a collection of some of his great responses to a series of these questions. For example, when a reader lobs the idea, ""What would happen if the Earth stopped rotating but the air kept moving?"" Munroe gets to the immediate answer (winds at ridiculous speeds, all over the world, all at once), then he goes on delightful explorations, like describing how the damage would happen (maybe X building would be OK from the wind, but it would still get destroyed by windborne debris), theorizing about the fascinating physics that would happen on ocean surfaces, contemplating which cities have enough subterranean architecture to sustain human life for a little while, and eventually ending his essay with a theory of what would get the planet spinning again. The science is backed up by sources at the back of the book (except, comically, when he'll make a claim like ""The ocean is really deep"" and throw in a [citation needed] reference), and adorable cartoons bring in side jokes and illustrate some of the trickier concepts.Some of the best chapters have little to do with science at all. Like, when a reader asks what would happen if everyone in the world jumped in the same place at the same time, the answer is simple (the planet outweighs the weight of humanity by so much that there would be no effect), so the essay gets into the logistical nightmares in the aftermath of billions of people gathering in one place. And there are some funny interstitials with disturbing questions that go unanswered, except by sarcastic one-panel comics.I'm not someone who would spend a lot of time on a book about physics. But I'll spend a lot of time on a humor book. Munroe has someone like me in mind when he writes this book, and I suspect that most readers will love it too."

If so, we can already begin to predict how the last installment will be named.If we assume that the title will, like its predecessors, consist of two words, the range of possibilities is quite large. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that the total number of unique two-word combinations in English is over 29 billion. If we then make the assumption that one of these words has to be a question word (who, what, where…) then the list is still massive—well over one million.

This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"".

Some of the science was way more complex than expected and I got a little lost. There were some really interesting ""What ifs?"", though, and the book gave me lots of new random trivia to share.Also, unless I was just reading a weird version that omitted it, I was disappointed that the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlac Pit (from the cover) was not in the book."
338,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"Somehow I’ve expected it to be better. I liked many things but I'm still a bit disappointed. The main problem is probably that most of the questions (or more like the answers to them) concerned astrophysics and generally advanced physics. These are definitely areas of knowledge that interest me least. Problems in probability or biology were much more interesting to me.Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about astrophysics and they all seemed quite similar to me. Therefore, the whole book seems a bit monotonous to me. It could use a greater variety of questions - from biology, chemistry, advanced mathematics, maybe even history (questions like what would happen if it happened otherwise). Maybe some questions closer to the humanities or social sciences. But the author sticks to everything that can be measured and counted quite precisely.I'm also a bit disappointed with the questions themselves. I expected them to be really crazy. Just look at the cover - a dinosaur thrown into what looks like a black hole in the desert from which some tentacles stick out. It promises to be great! And the subtitle ""Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions"". Well, these questions are not that weird or absurd. At least for a layman. Or maybe I just don't think about shooting a neutron bomb to Earth on a daily basis. I expected exactly what in the title, bizarre questions that will be of interest to me and to which I will get a professional answer. And that's why I'm a little disappointed.After some time, all the questions and answers merged into one and became a little boring. I even started skipping paragraphs in after the next astrophysics question.Also, I have the impression that the questions in the joke sections did not differ much from those to which the author was looking for answers. Maybe except that they were more interesting, sometimes macabre but usually more interesting. It is a pity that the author did not try to answer even briefly on them.This is not a bad book but more intended for people who are interested in physics. It also seems to me that sometimes I simply lacked a lot of knowledge to fully understand the answer to a question. I have already read similar books and some of them were more interesting. I'm afraid I didn't get as much knowledge from this as I did from them. The questions were too uninteresting and the answers too complicated."

The magic faded drastically after very interesting answers in the beginning.Favorites were :*What would happen if you hit a baseball pitched at 90% speed of light?*Would the Moon change colour if every person aimed a laser pointer at it simultaneously? [We had a real crazy discussion  for this in a group!]*What would happen if real cube shaped Elements bricks are placed at respective position in a Periodic table?*If every human disappeared, which would be the last artificial light source to go out?Some of the comic strips were really hilarious!"
340,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35465603-natalia-de-lune,5," Randall Munroe is brilliant. I know he would disagree with me on this matter. Randall considers himself a simple cartoonist/former NASA roboticist ( just think how cool his curriculum must be),but I have been following his work for long enough to be convinced that he is anything other than brilliant. And I don’t use this term loosely. I’m not talking about his physics knowledge in particular, but mostly about his ability to pass the knowledge forward. It’s easy to understand, and it’s entertaining. I was enthralled to find out he wrote a book, and as the professional lazy person I’m proud to be, I’m only reviewing this now. Anyway, I finally got my lazy ass to finish reading, and it’s exactly what I was expecting: It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s brilliant. I’ve laughed out loud more times than I cared to count,specially at the “Weird and Worrying questions”. I’ve chosen a few of my favorite ones:•	What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? •	 Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee?•	What if everyone actually had only one soul mate,a random person somewhere on the world?•	What if you strapped C4 to a boomerang?

342,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,4,"Randall Patrick Munroe is many things; a former NASA roboticist, the mind behind the scientifically corky and totally hilarious xkcd comic, and the author of What if? In What if? Munroe uses drawings (same as in xkcd), math, some engineering-know-how and tons of logical reasoning to answer outlandish but intriguing questions, all proving that science can be fun and that learning how to think critically is a skill we all need (and must develop). I’m a scientist and I like anything and everything that helps others discover how incredibly entertaining thinking critically and using science can be, so I enjoyed this book enormously. Bonus points, you can read a question at a time just before going to bed as a way to give your brain something to chew on that’s not the present state of the world, but you can also read a bunch of the questions all at once for a more immersive experience. What the heck, you can even have this book near the toilet and read a question each time you’re there. I guarantee you, after a week of that, you won’t even care about bringing your phone along to play candy crush or plants vs zombies or whatever else you’ve been doing there with your phone. As I read the book, I discovered that my favorites questions all seemed to have something in common: they reminded me of instances where Hollywood movies use deux-ex-machina-not scientific-at-all solutions for their plot problems. Think Superman (1978) and the infamous scene when the aforementioned superhero flights around the Earth until it stops it and turns its rotation, and somehow time as well, back. Well the very first question in the book deals with that: What would happen of the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? And it does a fantastic job at showing that Superman would have killed us all gaining absolutely nothing from his misdirected efforts.Munroe’s writing is as witty as it is serious and that works just well in the context of this book and the way it is organize.A solid four star, and a good book to have around to keep your mind entertained and in top shape."

349,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,5,"I firmly believe that that the key to making science accessible to the public at large is to make it FUN. Yes, it also needs to be written at a layman’s level in easily understandable language. But to REACH a large proportion of people, it needs to be interesting and engaging. Humor helps with that a lot. Randall Munroe, a former NASA roboticist and creator of the web comic “xkcd,” has a pretty good handle on how to merge all of these elements into a wildly entertaining trip through some basic science principles through the lens of crazy questions posed by his readers on the web page. As the full title of the book states, it’s “serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.” Now I will state that I LOVE this premise. It reminds me of some of the brainstorming techniques that I used to use as a practicing project manager. In a meeting designed to generate ideas, it’s a fun tactic to get the group to spit out the most outlandish scenarios first. By doing so, a good manager can bring a wealth of imagination to the table, and sometimes a group can strike gold with a course of action that might have seemed specious at first.  So in this book, you get questions like these: From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground in the same instant? And perhaps my favorite question: What would happen if you were to gather a mole (the unit of measurement) of moles (the small, furry critter) in one place? So author Munroe sets about to answering these absurd hypothetical questions, always with gentle humor and always illustrated with his signature stick figure drawings. He patiently wades through some TRULY wild questions with solid science and explanations that anyone with at least a basic understanding of science and math can easily understand. It’s a quick read and tons of fun. 51% of the material is brand new to this book, which means that…..anyone? Anyone? Bueller? …….49% of the material has already appeared on the “xkcd” web page. That probably makes it a worthwhile read even if you are a regular on the website. There are also a TON of interesting footnotes full of in-jokes and sly mirth.  Scientific literacy is in trouble in the USA. There is an urgent need for more rigorous training in basic science and math at EVERY level of the educational system. As such, I will give 5 stars for a book like this that aims to bring science to the masses in an engaging way. In my opinion, science NEEDS to be popularized and celebrated as much as possible. Randall Munroe is doing good work with his web page and this book. Carry on, good sir."
350,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18813588-brian-proffitt,5,"There are times I miss my physics degree.It's not that it went anywhere, mind you, but I have not really used it professionally and it does not come up in my daily life very often. There are exceptions, such as when I try to apply Newton's Third Law to explain politics to my kids: ""For every stupid thing someone says, there will be an equal (if not more) stupid thing said in response.""So when I read ""What If..."", Randall Munroe's collection of his What If? website's (http://what-if.xkcd.com/) more popular articles, there was a bit of melancholy and a tinge of envy. Here, after all, was someone doing really cool things with his physics degree.Then I enjoyed the book so ******* much I did not care.Disclaimer: I am a big Munroe fan (literally, if you'd seen my bathroom scale, you'd know), and read his main XKCD webcomic and What If? sites regularly. So much of this book came as no surprise. What appeals to me about Munroe's works if that while he is a scientist by trade, he seems to have the heart of a poet and satirist. He knows his math and his science, and there is also wit and charm and quite a bit of humor to his art and writing. Some of the humor is dark, but then so are some of the results of the hypothetical questions he gets.This is a book for anyone to read if they have even the most cursory interest in science. And everyone else should read it to get their interest stoked."

352,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,"“What If?” is this in a nutshell: imagine you have a completely random, yet somewhat science-related question. Now imagine that someone who is really smart, really funny, really diligent about research, and really good at explaining complex things in understandable terms takes your question seriously.Randall Munroe is this someone. I am very familiar with his XKCD work, and it’s addictive. The material in this book is also online, so if you’ve perused that webpage, there’s nothing “new” here. Even still, this book is enjoyable, and the writing and layout is pretty good. Obviously, if you’re into science and geeky things, this book is for you. I mean, who doesn’t want to know if you can launch yourself into the air with the power of an AK-47 or why we can’t drop a nuclear bomb into a volcano or hurricane to put a stop to the destructive power of nature (not recommended, by the way)? The best part are those bizarre facts the reader can store away, facts that can be presented in random conversation for no reason, just because you KNOW stuff about stuff.This is NOT a textbook with mundane questions and boring answers to those questions. This is in all actuality a well-thought out book pondering the questions many (unusual) people have, and not really knowing who to turn to for answers. Why not ask the XKCD guy? This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun by inserting them into an exploration of “what would happen if an impossible something” happened, leading to sobering, and often humorous conclusions.One other thing to note about this book: it is perfect to read in “chunks”, that is, reading a chapter or two at a time. Although, be forewarned, once this book is started, it is pretty hard to put down. Highly recommended!"

But it seemed really smart, so, if it seems smart it must = accurate.5/5 for humor. Seriously, most of the articles had me giggling, chuckling, or hysterically laughing at least once. I even dropped the book from cackling so hard. And, I appreciated that. This could have been dry and dull, but Munroe wouldn't allow that. He kept it entertaining and enlightening.5/5 for the questions picked. There are some really interesting questions in here. I wish I thought to ask some of them, but luckily, there are plenty of individuals in this world willing to ask the tough questions, like:""What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?""Or""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source go out?""Or""What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?""Of course, there were some questions too weird and worrisome which Munroe refused to answer, luckily he added them in for our enjoyment.And finally 5/5 for the art/comics Munroe added to coincide with the articles. They helped really bring each answer to laugh, while adding in an additional element to the humor.I cannot recommend this book fast enough if you haven't read it!

356,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am deeply suspicious whenever a book is sold on the basis that its author is in some sense famous, so I was immediately wary of Randall Munroe's What If, especially as the book was plastered with references to his internet science cartoon site xkcd. The press release gets even more excited, proclaiming 'Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer, the genius behind XKCD.com.' Damn him with faint praise, won't you? This isn't helped by the fact that the few times I've seen Munroe's stick cartoons, usually re-spread on social media, I haven't found them at all funny. So it was almost a disappointment when I discovered that I really liked this book.Munro gives detailed answers to weird questions asked from readers on his website. Questions like 'If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change colour?' and 'How much Force power can Yoda output?' There are even some questions that Munroe shakes his head and retreats from - things like 'How many houses are burned down in the US every year? What would be the easiest way to increase the number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)?'The answers given are light hearted, but take the challenge seriously and with some impressive back-of-an-envelope calculation and a touch of research deliver convincing answers. There is a distinguished precedent in taking absurd suggestions (admittedly self-generated) and using them to explore the realities of science in George Gamow's classic (if now rather difficult to read) Mr Tompkins books where, for instance, he explores what would happen if the speed of light reduced to a walking pace.The main problem with Gamow's books is that they suffer from an excess of whimsy, which was considered funny at the time, something that Munroe does occasional succumb to in his footnotes. Two other slight problems with What If are that some of the problems are so silly that it's easy to think 'So what?' and after a while the format gets a bit samey.However, it's hard not to admire the straight faced aplomb with which Munroe deals with weird problem after weird problem - and often takes them so far over the top they become more interesting still. (For instance when asking a question about a hair dryer in a box, he considers the outcome for different powers of hair dryers up to 11 petawatts, which is considerably more than the EU likes to allow for electrical goods. (Sorry, the whimsy is catching.) ) The fact is this is a very likeable and fun book that should entertain many readers."

Munroe creates the hilarious webcomic xkcd, and I guess he also solicits hypothetical questions from readers. This book is a collection of some of his great responses to a series of these questions. For example, when a reader lobs the idea, ""What would happen if the Earth stopped rotating but the air kept moving?"" Munroe gets to the immediate answer (winds at ridiculous speeds, all over the world, all at once), then he goes on delightful explorations, like describing how the damage would happen (maybe X building would be OK from the wind, but it would still get destroyed by windborne debris), theorizing about the fascinating physics that would happen on ocean surfaces, contemplating which cities have enough subterranean architecture to sustain human life for a little while, and eventually ending his essay with a theory of what would get the planet spinning again. The science is backed up by sources at the back of the book (except, comically, when he'll make a claim like ""The ocean is really deep"" and throw in a [citation needed] reference), and adorable cartoons bring in side jokes and illustrate some of the trickier concepts.Some of the best chapters have little to do with science at all. Like, when a reader asks what would happen if everyone in the world jumped in the same place at the same time, the answer is simple (the planet outweighs the weight of humanity by so much that there would be no effect), so the essay gets into the logistical nightmares in the aftermath of billions of people gathering in one place. And there are some funny interstitials with disturbing questions that go unanswered, except by sarcastic one-panel comics.I'm not someone who would spend a lot of time on a book about physics. But I'll spend a lot of time on a humor book. Munroe has someone like me in mind when he writes this book, and I suspect that most readers will love it too."

If so, we can already begin to predict how the last installment will be named.If we assume that the title will, like its predecessors, consist of two words, the range of possibilities is quite large. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that the total number of unique two-word combinations in English is over 29 billion. If we then make the assumption that one of these words has to be a question word (who, what, where…) then the list is still massive—well over one million.

This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"".

Some of the science was way more complex than expected and I got a little lost. There were some really interesting ""What ifs?"", though, and the book gave me lots of new random trivia to share.Also, unless I was just reading a weird version that omitted it, I was disappointed that the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlac Pit (from the cover) was not in the book."
368,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"Somehow I’ve expected it to be better. I liked many things but I'm still a bit disappointed. The main problem is probably that most of the questions (or more like the answers to them) concerned astrophysics and generally advanced physics. These are definitely areas of knowledge that interest me least. Problems in probability or biology were much more interesting to me.Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about astrophysics and they all seemed quite similar to me. Therefore, the whole book seems a bit monotonous to me. It could use a greater variety of questions - from biology, chemistry, advanced mathematics, maybe even history (questions like what would happen if it happened otherwise). Maybe some questions closer to the humanities or social sciences. But the author sticks to everything that can be measured and counted quite precisely.I'm also a bit disappointed with the questions themselves. I expected them to be really crazy. Just look at the cover - a dinosaur thrown into what looks like a black hole in the desert from which some tentacles stick out. It promises to be great! And the subtitle ""Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions"". Well, these questions are not that weird or absurd. At least for a layman. Or maybe I just don't think about shooting a neutron bomb to Earth on a daily basis. I expected exactly what in the title, bizarre questions that will be of interest to me and to which I will get a professional answer. And that's why I'm a little disappointed.After some time, all the questions and answers merged into one and became a little boring. I even started skipping paragraphs in after the next astrophysics question.Also, I have the impression that the questions in the joke sections did not differ much from those to which the author was looking for answers. Maybe except that they were more interesting, sometimes macabre but usually more interesting. It is a pity that the author did not try to answer even briefly on them.This is not a bad book but more intended for people who are interested in physics. It also seems to me that sometimes I simply lacked a lot of knowledge to fully understand the answer to a question. I have already read similar books and some of them were more interesting. I'm afraid I didn't get as much knowledge from this as I did from them. The questions were too uninteresting and the answers too complicated."

The magic faded drastically after very interesting answers in the beginning.Favorites were :*What would happen if you hit a baseball pitched at 90% speed of light?*Would the Moon change colour if every person aimed a laser pointer at it simultaneously? [We had a real crazy discussion  for this in a group!]*What would happen if real cube shaped Elements bricks are placed at respective position in a Periodic table?*If every human disappeared, which would be the last artificial light source to go out?Some of the comic strips were really hilarious!"
370,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35465603-natalia-de-lune,5," Randall Munroe is brilliant. I know he would disagree with me on this matter. Randall considers himself a simple cartoonist/former NASA roboticist ( just think how cool his curriculum must be),but I have been following his work for long enough to be convinced that he is anything other than brilliant. And I don’t use this term loosely. I’m not talking about his physics knowledge in particular, but mostly about his ability to pass the knowledge forward. It’s easy to understand, and it’s entertaining. I was enthralled to find out he wrote a book, and as the professional lazy person I’m proud to be, I’m only reviewing this now. Anyway, I finally got my lazy ass to finish reading, and it’s exactly what I was expecting: It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s brilliant. I’ve laughed out loud more times than I cared to count,specially at the “Weird and Worrying questions”. I’ve chosen a few of my favorite ones:•	What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? •	 Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee?•	What if everyone actually had only one soul mate,a random person somewhere on the world?•	What if you strapped C4 to a boomerang?

372,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,4,"Randall Patrick Munroe is many things; a former NASA roboticist, the mind behind the scientifically corky and totally hilarious xkcd comic, and the author of What if? In What if? Munroe uses drawings (same as in xkcd), math, some engineering-know-how and tons of logical reasoning to answer outlandish but intriguing questions, all proving that science can be fun and that learning how to think critically is a skill we all need (and must develop). I’m a scientist and I like anything and everything that helps others discover how incredibly entertaining thinking critically and using science can be, so I enjoyed this book enormously. Bonus points, you can read a question at a time just before going to bed as a way to give your brain something to chew on that’s not the present state of the world, but you can also read a bunch of the questions all at once for a more immersive experience. What the heck, you can even have this book near the toilet and read a question each time you’re there. I guarantee you, after a week of that, you won’t even care about bringing your phone along to play candy crush or plants vs zombies or whatever else you’ve been doing there with your phone. As I read the book, I discovered that my favorites questions all seemed to have something in common: they reminded me of instances where Hollywood movies use deux-ex-machina-not scientific-at-all solutions for their plot problems. Think Superman (1978) and the infamous scene when the aforementioned superhero flights around the Earth until it stops it and turns its rotation, and somehow time as well, back. Well the very first question in the book deals with that: What would happen of the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? And it does a fantastic job at showing that Superman would have killed us all gaining absolutely nothing from his misdirected efforts.Munroe’s writing is as witty as it is serious and that works just well in the context of this book and the way it is organize.A solid four star, and a good book to have around to keep your mind entertained and in top shape."

379,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,5,"I firmly believe that that the key to making science accessible to the public at large is to make it FUN. Yes, it also needs to be written at a layman’s level in easily understandable language. But to REACH a large proportion of people, it needs to be interesting and engaging. Humor helps with that a lot. Randall Munroe, a former NASA roboticist and creator of the web comic “xkcd,” has a pretty good handle on how to merge all of these elements into a wildly entertaining trip through some basic science principles through the lens of crazy questions posed by his readers on the web page. As the full title of the book states, it’s “serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.” Now I will state that I LOVE this premise. It reminds me of some of the brainstorming techniques that I used to use as a practicing project manager. In a meeting designed to generate ideas, it’s a fun tactic to get the group to spit out the most outlandish scenarios first. By doing so, a good manager can bring a wealth of imagination to the table, and sometimes a group can strike gold with a course of action that might have seemed specious at first.  So in this book, you get questions like these: From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground in the same instant? And perhaps my favorite question: What would happen if you were to gather a mole (the unit of measurement) of moles (the small, furry critter) in one place? So author Munroe sets about to answering these absurd hypothetical questions, always with gentle humor and always illustrated with his signature stick figure drawings. He patiently wades through some TRULY wild questions with solid science and explanations that anyone with at least a basic understanding of science and math can easily understand. It’s a quick read and tons of fun. 51% of the material is brand new to this book, which means that…..anyone? Anyone? Bueller? …….49% of the material has already appeared on the “xkcd” web page. That probably makes it a worthwhile read even if you are a regular on the website. There are also a TON of interesting footnotes full of in-jokes and sly mirth.  Scientific literacy is in trouble in the USA. There is an urgent need for more rigorous training in basic science and math at EVERY level of the educational system. As such, I will give 5 stars for a book like this that aims to bring science to the masses in an engaging way. In my opinion, science NEEDS to be popularized and celebrated as much as possible. Randall Munroe is doing good work with his web page and this book. Carry on, good sir."
380,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18813588-brian-proffitt,5,"There are times I miss my physics degree.It's not that it went anywhere, mind you, but I have not really used it professionally and it does not come up in my daily life very often. There are exceptions, such as when I try to apply Newton's Third Law to explain politics to my kids: ""For every stupid thing someone says, there will be an equal (if not more) stupid thing said in response.""So when I read ""What If..."", Randall Munroe's collection of his What If? website's (http://what-if.xkcd.com/) more popular articles, there was a bit of melancholy and a tinge of envy. Here, after all, was someone doing really cool things with his physics degree.Then I enjoyed the book so ******* much I did not care.Disclaimer: I am a big Munroe fan (literally, if you'd seen my bathroom scale, you'd know), and read his main XKCD webcomic and What If? sites regularly. So much of this book came as no surprise. What appeals to me about Munroe's works if that while he is a scientist by trade, he seems to have the heart of a poet and satirist. He knows his math and his science, and there is also wit and charm and quite a bit of humor to his art and writing. Some of the humor is dark, but then so are some of the results of the hypothetical questions he gets.This is a book for anyone to read if they have even the most cursory interest in science. And everyone else should read it to get their interest stoked."

382,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,"“What If?” is this in a nutshell: imagine you have a completely random, yet somewhat science-related question. Now imagine that someone who is really smart, really funny, really diligent about research, and really good at explaining complex things in understandable terms takes your question seriously.Randall Munroe is this someone. I am very familiar with his XKCD work, and it’s addictive. The material in this book is also online, so if you’ve perused that webpage, there’s nothing “new” here. Even still, this book is enjoyable, and the writing and layout is pretty good. Obviously, if you’re into science and geeky things, this book is for you. I mean, who doesn’t want to know if you can launch yourself into the air with the power of an AK-47 or why we can’t drop a nuclear bomb into a volcano or hurricane to put a stop to the destructive power of nature (not recommended, by the way)? The best part are those bizarre facts the reader can store away, facts that can be presented in random conversation for no reason, just because you KNOW stuff about stuff.This is NOT a textbook with mundane questions and boring answers to those questions. This is in all actuality a well-thought out book pondering the questions many (unusual) people have, and not really knowing who to turn to for answers. Why not ask the XKCD guy? This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun by inserting them into an exploration of “what would happen if an impossible something” happened, leading to sobering, and often humorous conclusions.One other thing to note about this book: it is perfect to read in “chunks”, that is, reading a chapter or two at a time. Although, be forewarned, once this book is started, it is pretty hard to put down. Highly recommended!"

But it seemed really smart, so, if it seems smart it must = accurate.5/5 for humor. Seriously, most of the articles had me giggling, chuckling, or hysterically laughing at least once. I even dropped the book from cackling so hard. And, I appreciated that. This could have been dry and dull, but Munroe wouldn't allow that. He kept it entertaining and enlightening.5/5 for the questions picked. There are some really interesting questions in here. I wish I thought to ask some of them, but luckily, there are plenty of individuals in this world willing to ask the tough questions, like:""What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?""Or""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source go out?""Or""What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?""Of course, there were some questions too weird and worrisome which Munroe refused to answer, luckily he added them in for our enjoyment.And finally 5/5 for the art/comics Munroe added to coincide with the articles. They helped really bring each answer to laugh, while adding in an additional element to the humor.I cannot recommend this book fast enough if you haven't read it!

386,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am deeply suspicious whenever a book is sold on the basis that its author is in some sense famous, so I was immediately wary of Randall Munroe's What If, especially as the book was plastered with references to his internet science cartoon site xkcd. The press release gets even more excited, proclaiming 'Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer, the genius behind XKCD.com.' Damn him with faint praise, won't you? This isn't helped by the fact that the few times I've seen Munroe's stick cartoons, usually re-spread on social media, I haven't found them at all funny. So it was almost a disappointment when I discovered that I really liked this book.Munro gives detailed answers to weird questions asked from readers on his website. Questions like 'If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change colour?' and 'How much Force power can Yoda output?' There are even some questions that Munroe shakes his head and retreats from - things like 'How many houses are burned down in the US every year? What would be the easiest way to increase the number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)?'The answers given are light hearted, but take the challenge seriously and with some impressive back-of-an-envelope calculation and a touch of research deliver convincing answers. There is a distinguished precedent in taking absurd suggestions (admittedly self-generated) and using them to explore the realities of science in George Gamow's classic (if now rather difficult to read) Mr Tompkins books where, for instance, he explores what would happen if the speed of light reduced to a walking pace.The main problem with Gamow's books is that they suffer from an excess of whimsy, which was considered funny at the time, something that Munroe does occasional succumb to in his footnotes. Two other slight problems with What If are that some of the problems are so silly that it's easy to think 'So what?' and after a while the format gets a bit samey.However, it's hard not to admire the straight faced aplomb with which Munroe deals with weird problem after weird problem - and often takes them so far over the top they become more interesting still. (For instance when asking a question about a hair dryer in a box, he considers the outcome for different powers of hair dryers up to 11 petawatts, which is considerably more than the EU likes to allow for electrical goods. (Sorry, the whimsy is catching.) ) The fact is this is a very likeable and fun book that should entertain many readers."

Munroe creates the hilarious webcomic xkcd, and I guess he also solicits hypothetical questions from readers. This book is a collection of some of his great responses to a series of these questions. For example, when a reader lobs the idea, ""What would happen if the Earth stopped rotating but the air kept moving?"" Munroe gets to the immediate answer (winds at ridiculous speeds, all over the world, all at once), then he goes on delightful explorations, like describing how the damage would happen (maybe X building would be OK from the wind, but it would still get destroyed by windborne debris), theorizing about the fascinating physics that would happen on ocean surfaces, contemplating which cities have enough subterranean architecture to sustain human life for a little while, and eventually ending his essay with a theory of what would get the planet spinning again. The science is backed up by sources at the back of the book (except, comically, when he'll make a claim like ""The ocean is really deep"" and throw in a [citation needed] reference), and adorable cartoons bring in side jokes and illustrate some of the trickier concepts.Some of the best chapters have little to do with science at all. Like, when a reader asks what would happen if everyone in the world jumped in the same place at the same time, the answer is simple (the planet outweighs the weight of humanity by so much that there would be no effect), so the essay gets into the logistical nightmares in the aftermath of billions of people gathering in one place. And there are some funny interstitials with disturbing questions that go unanswered, except by sarcastic one-panel comics.I'm not someone who would spend a lot of time on a book about physics. But I'll spend a lot of time on a humor book. Munroe has someone like me in mind when he writes this book, and I suspect that most readers will love it too."

If so, we can already begin to predict how the last installment will be named.If we assume that the title will, like its predecessors, consist of two words, the range of possibilities is quite large. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that the total number of unique two-word combinations in English is over 29 billion. If we then make the assumption that one of these words has to be a question word (who, what, where…) then the list is still massive—well over one million.

I mean why would I even give a fuck ""what would happen if you were to gather a mole of moles in one place"", or ""how many unique English tweets are possible and how long it would take for the population of the world to read them out loud"" (what the fuck???), or ""if you call a random phone number and say god bless you, what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed"", or ""what would happen if you tried to fly a normal Earth airplane in space""? This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"". Honestly I haven't seen so much useless information gathered together ever before. The extra star goes for the author's occasionally witty sense of humor."

This book will be better appreciated if one has some kind of scientific background and a somewhat superficial understanding of Physics (at least a basic knowledge).

Some of the science was way more complex than expected and I got a little lost. There were some really interesting ""What ifs?"", though, and the book gave me lots of new random trivia to share.Also, unless I was just reading a weird version that omitted it, I was disappointed that the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlac Pit (from the cover) was not in the book."
398,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"Somehow I’ve expected it to be better. I liked many things but I'm still a bit disappointed. The main problem is probably that most of the questions (or more like the answers to them) concerned astrophysics and generally advanced physics. These are definitely areas of knowledge that interest me least. Problems in probability or biology were much more interesting to me.Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about astrophysics and they all seemed quite similar to me. Therefore, the whole book seems a bit monotonous to me. It could use a greater variety of questions - from biology, chemistry, advanced mathematics, maybe even history (questions like what would happen if it happened otherwise). Maybe some questions closer to the humanities or social sciences. But the author sticks to everything that can be measured and counted quite precisely.I'm also a bit disappointed with the questions themselves. I expected them to be really crazy. Just look at the cover - a dinosaur thrown into what looks like a black hole in the desert from which some tentacles stick out. It promises to be great! And the subtitle ""Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions"". Well, these questions are not that weird or absurd. At least for a layman. Or maybe I just don't think about shooting a neutron bomb to Earth on a daily basis. I expected exactly what in the title, bizarre questions that will be of interest to me and to which I will get a professional answer. And that's why I'm a little disappointed.After some time, all the questions and answers merged into one and became a little boring. I even started skipping paragraphs in after the next astrophysics question.Also, I have the impression that the questions in the joke sections did not differ much from those to which the author was looking for answers. Maybe except that they were more interesting, sometimes macabre but usually more interesting. It is a pity that the author did not try to answer even briefly on them.This is not a bad book but more intended for people who are interested in physics. It also seems to me that sometimes I simply lacked a lot of knowledge to fully understand the answer to a question. I have already read similar books and some of them were more interesting. I'm afraid I didn't get as much knowledge from this as I did from them. The questions were too uninteresting and the answers too complicated."

The magic faded drastically after very interesting answers in the beginning.Favorites were :*What would happen if you hit a baseball pitched at 90% speed of light?*Would the Moon change colour if every person aimed a laser pointer at it simultaneously? [We had a real crazy discussion  for this in a group!]*What would happen if real cube shaped Elements bricks are placed at respective position in a Periodic table?*If every human disappeared, which would be the last artificial light source to go out?Some of the comic strips were really hilarious!"
400,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35465603-natalia-de-lune,5," Randall Munroe is brilliant. I know he would disagree with me on this matter. Randall considers himself a simple cartoonist/former NASA roboticist ( just think how cool his curriculum must be),but I have been following his work for long enough to be convinced that he is anything other than brilliant. And I don’t use this term loosely. I’m not talking about his physics knowledge in particular, but mostly about his ability to pass the knowledge forward. It’s easy to understand, and it’s entertaining. I was enthralled to find out he wrote a book, and as the professional lazy person I’m proud to be, I’m only reviewing this now. Anyway, I finally got my lazy ass to finish reading, and it’s exactly what I was expecting: It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s brilliant. I’ve laughed out loud more times than I cared to count,specially at the “Weird and Worrying questions”. I’ve chosen a few of my favorite ones:•	What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? •	 Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee?•	What if everyone actually had only one soul mate,a random person somewhere on the world?•	What if you strapped C4 to a boomerang?

402,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,4,"Randall Patrick Munroe is many things; a former NASA roboticist, the mind behind the scientifically corky and totally hilarious xkcd comic, and the author of What if? In What if? Munroe uses drawings (same as in xkcd), math, some engineering-know-how and tons of logical reasoning to answer outlandish but intriguing questions, all proving that science can be fun and that learning how to think critically is a skill we all need (and must develop). I’m a scientist and I like anything and everything that helps others discover how incredibly entertaining thinking critically and using science can be, so I enjoyed this book enormously. Bonus points, you can read a question at a time just before going to bed as a way to give your brain something to chew on that’s not the present state of the world, but you can also read a bunch of the questions all at once for a more immersive experience. What the heck, you can even have this book near the toilet and read a question each time you’re there. I guarantee you, after a week of that, you won’t even care about bringing your phone along to play candy crush or plants vs zombies or whatever else you’ve been doing there with your phone. As I read the book, I discovered that my favorites questions all seemed to have something in common: they reminded me of instances where Hollywood movies use deux-ex-machina-not scientific-at-all solutions for their plot problems. Think Superman (1978) and the infamous scene when the aforementioned superhero flights around the Earth until it stops it and turns its rotation, and somehow time as well, back. Well the very first question in the book deals with that: What would happen of the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? And it does a fantastic job at showing that Superman would have killed us all gaining absolutely nothing from his misdirected efforts.Munroe’s writing is as witty as it is serious and that works just well in the context of this book and the way it is organize.A solid four star, and a good book to have around to keep your mind entertained and in top shape."

409,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,5,"I firmly believe that that the key to making science accessible to the public at large is to make it FUN. Yes, it also needs to be written at a layman’s level in easily understandable language. But to REACH a large proportion of people, it needs to be interesting and engaging. Humor helps with that a lot. Randall Munroe, a former NASA roboticist and creator of the web comic “xkcd,” has a pretty good handle on how to merge all of these elements into a wildly entertaining trip through some basic science principles through the lens of crazy questions posed by his readers on the web page. As the full title of the book states, it’s “serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.” Now I will state that I LOVE this premise. It reminds me of some of the brainstorming techniques that I used to use as a practicing project manager. In a meeting designed to generate ideas, it’s a fun tactic to get the group to spit out the most outlandish scenarios first. By doing so, a good manager can bring a wealth of imagination to the table, and sometimes a group can strike gold with a course of action that might have seemed specious at first.  So in this book, you get questions like these: From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground in the same instant? And perhaps my favorite question: What would happen if you were to gather a mole (the unit of measurement) of moles (the small, furry critter) in one place? So author Munroe sets about to answering these absurd hypothetical questions, always with gentle humor and always illustrated with his signature stick figure drawings. He patiently wades through some TRULY wild questions with solid science and explanations that anyone with at least a basic understanding of science and math can easily understand. It’s a quick read and tons of fun. 51% of the material is brand new to this book, which means that…..anyone? Anyone? Bueller? …….49% of the material has already appeared on the “xkcd” web page. That probably makes it a worthwhile read even if you are a regular on the website. There are also a TON of interesting footnotes full of in-jokes and sly mirth.  Scientific literacy is in trouble in the USA. There is an urgent need for more rigorous training in basic science and math at EVERY level of the educational system. As such, I will give 5 stars for a book like this that aims to bring science to the masses in an engaging way. In my opinion, science NEEDS to be popularized and celebrated as much as possible. Randall Munroe is doing good work with his web page and this book. Carry on, good sir."

There are exceptions, such as when I try to apply Newton's Third Law to explain politics to my kids: ""For every stupid thing someone says, there will be an equal (if not more) stupid thing said in response.""So when I read ""What If..."", Randall Munroe's collection of his What If? website's (http://what-if.xkcd.com/) more popular articles, there was a bit of melancholy and a tinge of envy. Here, after all, was someone doing really cool things with his physics degree.Then I enjoyed the book so ******* much I did not care.Disclaimer: I am a big Munroe fan (literally, if you'd seen my bathroom scale, you'd know), and read his main XKCD webcomic and What If? sites regularly. So much of this book came as no surprise. What appeals to me about Munroe's works if that while he is a scientist by trade, he seems to have the heart of a poet and satirist. He knows his math and his science, and there is also wit and charm and quite a bit of humor to his art and writing. Some of the humor is dark, but then so are some of the results of the hypothetical questions he gets.This is a book for anyone to read if they have even the most cursory interest in science. And everyone else should read it to get their interest stoked."

412,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,"“What If?” is this in a nutshell: imagine you have a completely random, yet somewhat science-related question. Now imagine that someone who is really smart, really funny, really diligent about research, and really good at explaining complex things in understandable terms takes your question seriously.Randall Munroe is this someone. I am very familiar with his XKCD work, and it’s addictive. The material in this book is also online, so if you’ve perused that webpage, there’s nothing “new” here. Even still, this book is enjoyable, and the writing and layout is pretty good. Obviously, if you’re into science and geeky things, this book is for you. I mean, who doesn’t want to know if you can launch yourself into the air with the power of an AK-47 or why we can’t drop a nuclear bomb into a volcano or hurricane to put a stop to the destructive power of nature (not recommended, by the way)? The best part are those bizarre facts the reader can store away, facts that can be presented in random conversation for no reason, just because you KNOW stuff about stuff.This is NOT a textbook with mundane questions and boring answers to those questions. This is in all actuality a well-thought out book pondering the questions many (unusual) people have, and not really knowing who to turn to for answers. Why not ask the XKCD guy? This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun by inserting them into an exploration of “what would happen if an impossible something” happened, leading to sobering, and often humorous conclusions.One other thing to note about this book: it is perfect to read in “chunks”, that is, reading a chapter or two at a time. Although, be forewarned, once this book is started, it is pretty hard to put down. Highly recommended!"

But it seemed really smart, so, if it seems smart it must = accurate.5/5 for humor. Seriously, most of the articles had me giggling, chuckling, or hysterically laughing at least once. I even dropped the book from cackling so hard. And, I appreciated that. This could have been dry and dull, but Munroe wouldn't allow that. He kept it entertaining and enlightening.5/5 for the questions picked. There are some really interesting questions in here. I wish I thought to ask some of them, but luckily, there are plenty of individuals in this world willing to ask the tough questions, like:""What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?""Or""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source go out?""Or""What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?""Of course, there were some questions too weird and worrisome which Munroe refused to answer, luckily he added them in for our enjoyment.And finally 5/5 for the art/comics Munroe added to coincide with the articles. They helped really bring each answer to laugh, while adding in an additional element to the humor.I cannot recommend this book fast enough if you haven't read it!

416,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am deeply suspicious whenever a book is sold on the basis that its author is in some sense famous, so I was immediately wary of Randall Munroe's What If, especially as the book was plastered with references to his internet science cartoon site xkcd. The press release gets even more excited, proclaiming 'Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer, the genius behind XKCD.com.' Damn him with faint praise, won't you? This isn't helped by the fact that the few times I've seen Munroe's stick cartoons, usually re-spread on social media, I haven't found them at all funny. So it was almost a disappointment when I discovered that I really liked this book.Munro gives detailed answers to weird questions asked from readers on his website. Questions like 'If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change colour?' and 'How much Force power can Yoda output?' There are even some questions that Munroe shakes his head and retreats from - things like 'How many houses are burned down in the US every year? What would be the easiest way to increase the number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)?'The answers given are light hearted, but take the challenge seriously and with some impressive back-of-an-envelope calculation and a touch of research deliver convincing answers. There is a distinguished precedent in taking absurd suggestions (admittedly self-generated) and using them to explore the realities of science in George Gamow's classic (if now rather difficult to read) Mr Tompkins books where, for instance, he explores what would happen if the speed of light reduced to a walking pace.The main problem with Gamow's books is that they suffer from an excess of whimsy, which was considered funny at the time, something that Munroe does occasional succumb to in his footnotes. Two other slight problems with What If are that some of the problems are so silly that it's easy to think 'So what?' and after a while the format gets a bit samey.However, it's hard not to admire the straight faced aplomb with which Munroe deals with weird problem after weird problem - and often takes them so far over the top they become more interesting still. (For instance when asking a question about a hair dryer in a box, he considers the outcome for different powers of hair dryers up to 11 petawatts, which is considerably more than the EU likes to allow for electrical goods. (Sorry, the whimsy is catching.) ) The fact is this is a very likeable and fun book that should entertain many readers."

Munroe creates the hilarious webcomic xkcd, and I guess he also solicits hypothetical questions from readers. This book is a collection of some of his great responses to a series of these questions. For example, when a reader lobs the idea, ""What would happen if the Earth stopped rotating but the air kept moving?"" Munroe gets to the immediate answer (winds at ridiculous speeds, all over the world, all at once), then he goes on delightful explorations, like describing how the damage would happen (maybe X building would be OK from the wind, but it would still get destroyed by windborne debris), theorizing about the fascinating physics that would happen on ocean surfaces, contemplating which cities have enough subterranean architecture to sustain human life for a little while, and eventually ending his essay with a theory of what would get the planet spinning again. The science is backed up by sources at the back of the book (except, comically, when he'll make a claim like ""The ocean is really deep"" and throw in a [citation needed] reference), and adorable cartoons bring in side jokes and illustrate some of the trickier concepts.Some of the best chapters have little to do with science at all. Like, when a reader asks what would happen if everyone in the world jumped in the same place at the same time, the answer is simple (the planet outweighs the weight of humanity by so much that there would be no effect), so the essay gets into the logistical nightmares in the aftermath of billions of people gathering in one place. And there are some funny interstitials with disturbing questions that go unanswered, except by sarcastic one-panel comics.I'm not someone who would spend a lot of time on a book about physics. But I'll spend a lot of time on a humor book. Munroe has someone like me in mind when he writes this book, and I suspect that most readers will love it too."
420,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,2,"So, hey, I get it, it's pretty funny. But when the sub-title to this book has the phrase ""Serious Scientific Answers"" and then 90% of the answers precis with ""let's first ignore the physics of Earth to answer this questions about something relating to the physics of light,"" I wonder how ""serious"" it really is. And it also gets a little tiresome because while the humor is pretty good, the tone and tenor is exceptionally single-note. There's some hearty guffaws and hoots and knee-slaps to be had, but at the end the questions are thin ""OMG SO RANDOM!!!!,"" and you can tell many of the submissions were people reaching a tad too hard for the absurd, wanting to be included in the book--ie. they're absurd for no real value than giggles.Times reminded me of that television show Mythbusters where the basic scientific principal behind the ""myth,"" or, in this case, the ""absurd question,"" is presented in a fairly straightforward way in approximately 2 sentences. Then, the proceeding 3-5 pages was jocular ""serious science"" that ""ignored"" the realities of physical possibility for the sake of comedy. Maybe I'm being to hard on it for being a comical book. But as a book of comedy, then shouldn't it offer more than just ""goofy"" as it's comic device? There's some great slapstick. Funny moments of the absurd. But halfway through, I was met with disinterest, slogging through. I was even reading this thing at a leisurely pace over the course of the past month or so.I've enjoyed Munroe's webcomic presence since I first discovered it sometime around 2010, but somehow seeing it laid bare, page after page exposed its thin fragility. How simplistic it really is, hiding behind a veil of scientific jargon and goofy-absurd premises. The book gave pleasure and entertainment, but not a sustained sensation of either. Perhaps best served as a ""coffee table book"" left to be dipped into randomly rather than read cover to cover, even if over the course of several weeks."

I'm debating giving copies out for Halloween this year. I'll buy a copy for your kid if he or she (especially she) wants one.If you are already familiar with http://what-if.xkcd.com/ then you know what this book is like: Sort of a Straight Dope meets Richard Feynman deal in which outlandish questions are answered with heaps of playful speculation, physics, math, and whatnot.I bought this book for Matt, but I read it in one sitting. It reminded me of everything I liked about my math and science classes growing up, especially the playfulness and creativity of learning things and then applying them to different problems.The questions are very silly, by the way, almost to the point of being inconsequential. (Examples: What if everyone pointed a laser pointer at the moon? What if the Earth stopped rotating? What if you had a mole [the number] of moles [the animal]?) But that's part of what makes the answers so great. There are some questions that even Mr. Munroe refuses to answer, which are also lovingly captured.When I tossed the book to Matt, he saw the cartoon of a T. Rex being lowered into a Sarlacc via a crane and said cool. The next day he was excited to talk with me about baseballs going at relativistic speeds.Highly recommended.

Well, he actually quit his job to start drawing cartoons at xkcd.com, so I don't know where his workspace is now... Frankly, covid-19 has me holed up in my basement most of the time now (it's where most of the books are, after all). Example of a comic found on his website: This book is informative, gleeful, and irreverent as Munroe goes about exploring questions as crazy as ""From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?"" or as strangly specific as ""How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean?"" Such questions have been gathered from Munroe's website, and the derivation of his thoroughly researched answers follows. You need to suspend your disbelief, take on some giant assumptions, and add some sanity by a combined form of physics (mostly), chemistry, and biology—what you get out of this book are weird but detailed answers that make you raise your eyebrows, laugh, or both. It's fast and fun, easy to devour in one sitting but just as easy to put down and come back to at no great loss. What more could you want?"
428,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11281532-lita,4,"I don't usually read popular science books, but I'm a fan of scientific or academic comics (including the ones done by the author) - it just helps to put a bit of fun into the academic world. This particular book, however, was not a bad read. People have really outdone themselves sending in really weird questions. And the author, on his part, has sometimes gone out of the way to give decent and comprehensible answers. It helps that the book has short chapters and you can pick it up anytime and read any one of them. It might give you some weird insights to impress your friends at the next party. Was it funny? I'd say yes. But more than once I felt that the footnotes were the funniest (however, I'm not sure everyone would get the humor). How much do I remember? Sorry, but not much. I guess, it just means that I can pick it up again in a little while and re-read some bits. Illustrations were great, though. And I liked that it didn't focus just on physics."

So above is the disclaimer at the start of this book which sums up its contents in the most perfect way possible.This book is educating, hilarious, erudite, filled with science, stick figure cartoons, ideas that can bring about the end of your neighbourhood and also brimming with straight scientific facts. Personally, I have always wondered how it would be to become Superman and soar above planet Earth in a regal fashion. Dressed in spandex tights with glaringly bright red underwear worn atop my trousers and a billowing red cape, I shall fly faster than a speeding bullet into the stratospehere. But from a biological POV since I am not an alien the atmosphere would kill me pretty quickly. I have always wondered if the cold would kill me first or the lack of air would. Munroe surprised me by answering this question among a multitude of others in the book. I would become a popsicle way before the lack of air would have turned me blue. (Note to self : It is always better to imagine yourself as Iron Man for you can have a controlled environment inside the suit. Go Tony !)The author runs a very popular website named xkcd where he answers questions from the curious audience with the aid of science and mathematics. The book is a collection of some of the most popular questions posted on the website along with their scientific answers. Some of the questions might appear to be too absurd but here is what the author thinks of them :They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about hard and soft things, for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying thoroughly to answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.If text books were written in such a fashion, I wouldn’t have had selective amnesia about my physics class. Ah well, it’s never too late to discover books that can show you the right path. If you are a geek god like Patrick Rothfuss who tore through the entire book in two nights then the book wouldn’t overwhelm you. However, if you prefer spending some time mulling over the ideas and setting them down firmly in your mind then it would be better to break this down into chapters and read over a few days. It makes for even more fun and a sound understanding of the concepts.Oh and when you are at it, try and build a wall of the periodic table of elements with the cubes being built of the elements themselves. It will be a spectacle to behold and if your town ( or state or country or even the continent) survives this, then it would make you an instant celebrity !"
430,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49346342-niamh,5,"This book is exactly the kind of book I needed to read. I was in a non-fiction reading slump before picking this up, because the non-fiction books I've attempted to read previously have been so dry and boring with massively long chapters that seem to get way off-point.As a scientist, I love learning about everything; the science of life, of how skyscrapers don't fall down, of why siblings fight all the time. But because I'm at university, science books often feel like work rather than a break from work. What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions came nowhere near giving me this feeling. This book is witty and well-written. It made me laugh multiple times over. It's also extremely educational, as it applies real-world science to very weird scenarios, as the title suggests. The science behind the explanations is very simply explained. Sure, the questions people have asked are probably never going to happen, and some of them are scientifically impossible, but the science behind it is the same. The cartoons are funny and offer some serious comic relief to what is already a hilarious book.One line that sticks with me as a chemistry major is this: ""There is no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word 'NO' scrawled over and over in charred blood."" I just laughed too much at this, because material safety data sheets are the bane of my existence sometimes, and it was just so relatable. I showed it to my chemistry friends, and they also loved it. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science, even in the smallest way."
431,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"The title of the book says it all - the science is well researched and there are serious answers to a variety of hypothetical (and largely irrelevant considering their feasibility). At times the science gets to be a little too detailed for casual reading. There is a touch of humour which runs through most of the questions which make for great reading. For instance, to a question on what would be the consequences to Earth in case the sun dies - Randall launches into a detailed explanation of all the positives, and finally ends by saying that we would all be dead though and not in a position to reap any of the mentioned benefits.There are a number of interesting questions such as - when would facebook have more dead people than living, what happens if you are caught up in lightning, what would happen is extremely powerful earthquakes and also very feeble ones, can we get rid of the common cold if we all stayed away from each other for 2 weeks, is it feasible to move all of mankind off Earth....etc.....A few of the questions selected for detailed explanations could have been better though. Overall, a great book, it is fun reading if you like science!"
432,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by actor Wil Wheaton who made the book more enjoyable to listen to with his humorous narration.This is a science book containing absurd, funny and weird questions that people have asked the author, Randall Munroe, on his very popular webcomic site, xkcd.com. He goes into much detail and different scenarios after he painstakingly answers these hypothetical questions. For example: How long would it take you to find another person on the earth if you were the only two on the planet? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humans live? You get the idea. I definitely recommend this for all the science geeks out there. It was fun to listen to while driving and a nice break from the norm. 4 stars. "

Whatever the reason, this book was able to make me laugh and keep my eyes wide with wonder through almost every page. The questions are delightful, if absurd. For example: If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color? Or, Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward-firing machine guns? One of my favorites: What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?The answers take each question seriously and bring in the relevant science.

For those that aren't the majority of these What if? questions aren't so much answered as turned up to 11 and then answered.For those looking for structure and a coherent theme, I would not recommend this book, but for those with a mad sense of humour, this might just be what you're looking for (citation needed) "

I don't mind Wil Wheaton as a narrator, he's not at all the best I've heard (and I think that maybe he thinks he is...) but he's adequate. However he was not the best choice for this book. I've heard Randall Munroe talk, and Wil Wheaton (to my ears) makes him sounds incredibly arrogant and condescending. That being said, I really enjoyed the book and the myriad interesting questions. "

What if? will give you some great laughs accompanied by unusual pieces of information. The book contains a lot of weird questions (makes me want to submit questions of my own too), in which you will definitely not show the same amount of interest, but some things in there will surely intrigue you.There are two drawbacks which made me drop the last star:1.0 The questions are way too randomly organized (mostly). Because the book has so many questions about so many topics, reading about different ideas may not be very comfortable to all readers (this is science we are talking about, even if it has been lightened). I would have suggested (as I do with these kinds of books) to collect the similar questions (or these of the same science field) to be in sequence (It will not fully work but still I think it will make it better). ex. questions about space, or about earth atmosphere, or about statistics. 2.0 The book doesn't take into consideration that not all readers have scientific background. The author tries to explain some things in advance, but not everything (he may need double the amount of paper and ink, but well, that would be the right way to do it, wouldn't it?)In general, I enjoyed reading the book, as it made me search things out. I am sure not everything will stick in my mind, but something will. The way of writing and sketches are really funny which lightened the mood. I loved most: What would happen if you build the actual periodic table?What if you have a mole (Avogadro Number) of moles?Can we really add more light to the moon by flashing laser pointers at it?What if we drained the oceans and send the water to Mars?What if the sun suddenly goes out?The hairdryer in the box.Self-Fertilizing (even though it was a little bit difficult to understand).and So many others.Very Recommended.

The questions raised are downright silly, and you can just picture a dorm room party where they are conceived. Even so, the author demonstrates some solid problem solving skills to give an approximation or simulation of a likely scenario. There is nothing like hypothetical problem solving to under stand the difference between really big numbers and really big compounded numbers. Question - if all the humans on earth could gather in one spot, what US state could they all fit in?a) Rhode Islandb) Indianac) Oregond) TexasThe answer is (view spoiler)[a) Rhode Island (hide spoiler)]. While that may seem surprising at first, it's a pretty simple problem to figure.

Ignorance is not bliss, but advertisers and politicians are hoping you remain in the dark. Along those lines, the author indirectly teaches healthy skepticism of facts and figures found on the internet.[citation needed]"
442,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"What If? is a fun outing in which the author of xkcd answers weird science questions while ignoring the implausibility of those situations ever arising. So we get things like “what if all the rain from a cloud fell in one big droplet” and “what if Earth started expanding” — and Munroe answers them, rummaging through scientific papers and obscure experimental results to find out his closest guess at what would happen. I can’t really speak for his science in most places (only the DNA question was really down my street), but given how pedantic the internet can be, I’m sure Munroe did his absolute best to find an answer that would be, if not incontestable, at least not easily dismissed.The whole thing is illustrated with Munroe’s usual stick figures, and I still remain completely baffled as to how the combination of his stick figures and his lettering can imbue things with feeling. It makes no sense. And yet the Moon promising to help the Earth start spinning again? Gah. Moon, I love you!He also has a humorous tone and a clear way of explaining, so despite the weird situations that he examines, it pretty much all makes sense… though I took his equations for granted, and any other calculations.Originally reviewed on my blog."

He tackles silly questions and gives genuine scientifically valid answers. On occasion he allows magic to first initiate something like a baseball being launched at 0.9 times the speed of light from a pitcher's hands, but promptly returns to actual physical rules of the universe.I learned quite a lot (and I have quite an ample scientific background) and genuinely laughed out loud on several occasions. His style of humour just fits perfectly, and he delivers a punchline in a way you'd never expect from a scientific explanation.Just excellent. Anyone with a moderate interest in science should get this book for a really enjoyable read. And it includes plenty of drawings to keep XKCD fans satisfied. "

I may never use (or even remember, for that matter) any of the facts mentioned in the book, but I had great fun, laugh-out-loud fun, and I was sorry to see the book end so soon. In the author's words,“They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about [whether there are more hard or soft things in the world], for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”I did go many interesting places with him, and while I'm sorry to have missed the illustrations in the printed edition of the book, I think the narrator was just as awesome as the books deserves."

450,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,2,"So, hey, I get it, it's pretty funny. But when the sub-title to this book has the phrase ""Serious Scientific Answers"" and then 90% of the answers precis with ""let's first ignore the physics of Earth to answer this questions about something relating to the physics of light,"" I wonder how ""serious"" it really is. And it also gets a little tiresome because while the humor is pretty good, the tone and tenor is exceptionally single-note. There's some hearty guffaws and hoots and knee-slaps to be had, but at the end the questions are thin ""OMG SO RANDOM!!!!,"" and you can tell many of the submissions were people reaching a tad too hard for the absurd, wanting to be included in the book--ie. they're absurd for no real value than giggles.Times reminded me of that television show Mythbusters where the basic scientific principal behind the ""myth,"" or, in this case, the ""absurd question,"" is presented in a fairly straightforward way in approximately 2 sentences. Then, the proceeding 3-5 pages was jocular ""serious science"" that ""ignored"" the realities of physical possibility for the sake of comedy. Maybe I'm being to hard on it for being a comical book. But as a book of comedy, then shouldn't it offer more than just ""goofy"" as it's comic device? There's some great slapstick. Funny moments of the absurd. But halfway through, I was met with disinterest, slogging through. I was even reading this thing at a leisurely pace over the course of the past month or so.I've enjoyed Munroe's webcomic presence since I first discovered it sometime around 2010, but somehow seeing it laid bare, page after page exposed its thin fragility. How simplistic it really is, hiding behind a veil of scientific jargon and goofy-absurd premises. The book gave pleasure and entertainment, but not a sustained sensation of either. Perhaps best served as a ""coffee table book"" left to be dipped into randomly rather than read cover to cover, even if over the course of several weeks."

I'm debating giving copies out for Halloween this year. I'll buy a copy for your kid if he or she (especially she) wants one.If you are already familiar with http://what-if.xkcd.com/ then you know what this book is like: Sort of a Straight Dope meets Richard Feynman deal in which outlandish questions are answered with heaps of playful speculation, physics, math, and whatnot.I bought this book for Matt, but I read it in one sitting. It reminded me of everything I liked about my math and science classes growing up, especially the playfulness and creativity of learning things and then applying them to different problems.The questions are very silly, by the way, almost to the point of being inconsequential. (Examples: What if everyone pointed a laser pointer at the moon? What if the Earth stopped rotating? What if you had a mole [the number] of moles [the animal]?) But that's part of what makes the answers so great. There are some questions that even Mr. Munroe refuses to answer, which are also lovingly captured.When I tossed the book to Matt, he saw the cartoon of a T.

Well, he actually quit his job to start drawing cartoons at xkcd.com, so I don't know where his workspace is now... Frankly, covid-19 has me holed up in my basement most of the time now (it's where most of the books are, after all). Example of a comic found on his website: This book is informative, gleeful, and irreverent as Munroe goes about exploring questions as crazy as ""From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?"" or as strangly specific as ""How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean?"" Such questions have been gathered from Munroe's website, and the derivation of his thoroughly researched answers follows. You need to suspend your disbelief, take on some giant assumptions, and add some sanity by a combined form of physics (mostly), chemistry, and biology—what you get out of this book are weird but detailed answers that make you raise your eyebrows, laugh, or both.

And the author, on his part, has sometimes gone out of the way to give decent and comprehensible answers. It helps that the book has short chapters and you can pick it up anytime and read any one of them. It might give you some weird insights to impress your friends at the next party. Was it funny? I'd say yes. But more than once I felt that the footnotes were the funniest (however, I'm not sure everyone would get the humor). How much do I remember? Sorry, but not much.

So above is the disclaimer at the start of this book which sums up its contents in the most perfect way possible.This book is educating, hilarious, erudite, filled with science, stick figure cartoons, ideas that can bring about the end of your neighbourhood and also brimming with straight scientific facts. Personally, I have always wondered how it would be to become Superman and soar above planet Earth in a regal fashion. Dressed in spandex tights with glaringly bright red underwear worn atop my trousers and a billowing red cape, I shall fly faster than a speeding bullet into the stratospehere. But from a biological POV since I am not an alien the atmosphere would kill me pretty quickly. I have always wondered if the cold would kill me first or the lack of air would. Munroe surprised me by answering this question among a multitude of others in the book. I would become a popsicle way before the lack of air would have turned me blue. (Note to self : It is always better to imagine yourself as Iron Man for you can have a controlled environment inside the suit. Go Tony !)The author runs a very popular website named xkcd where he answers questions from the curious audience with the aid of science and mathematics. The book is a collection of some of the most popular questions posted on the website along with their scientific answers. Some of the questions might appear to be too absurd but here is what the author thinks of them :They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about hard and soft things, for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying thoroughly to answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.If text books were written in such a fashion, I wouldn’t have had selective amnesia about my physics class. Ah well, it’s never too late to discover books that can show you the right path. If you are a geek god like Patrick Rothfuss who tore through the entire book in two nights then the book wouldn’t overwhelm you. However, if you prefer spending some time mulling over the ideas and setting them down firmly in your mind then it would be better to break this down into chapters and read over a few days. It makes for even more fun and a sound understanding of the concepts.Oh and when you are at it, try and build a wall of the periodic table of elements with the cubes being built of the elements themselves. It will be a spectacle to behold and if your town ( or state or country or even the continent) survives this, then it would make you an instant celebrity !"
460,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49346342-niamh,5,"This book is exactly the kind of book I needed to read. I was in a non-fiction reading slump before picking this up, because the non-fiction books I've attempted to read previously have been so dry and boring with massively long chapters that seem to get way off-point.As a scientist, I love learning about everything; the science of life, of how skyscrapers don't fall down, of why siblings fight all the time. But because I'm at university, science books often feel like work rather than a break from work. What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions came nowhere near giving me this feeling. This book is witty and well-written. It made me laugh multiple times over. It's also extremely educational, as it applies real-world science to very weird scenarios, as the title suggests. The science behind the explanations is very simply explained. Sure, the questions people have asked are probably never going to happen, and some of them are scientifically impossible, but the science behind it is the same. The cartoons are funny and offer some serious comic relief to what is already a hilarious book.One line that sticks with me as a chemistry major is this: ""There is no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word 'NO' scrawled over and over in charred blood."" I just laughed too much at this, because material safety data sheets are the bane of my existence sometimes, and it was just so relatable. I showed it to my chemistry friends, and they also loved it. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science, even in the smallest way."
461,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"The title of the book says it all - the science is well researched and there are serious answers to a variety of hypothetical (and largely irrelevant considering their feasibility). At times the science gets to be a little too detailed for casual reading. There is a touch of humour which runs through most of the questions which make for great reading. For instance, to a question on what would be the consequences to Earth in case the sun dies - Randall launches into a detailed explanation of all the positives, and finally ends by saying that we would all be dead though and not in a position to reap any of the mentioned benefits.There are a number of interesting questions such as - when would facebook have more dead people than living, what happens if you are caught up in lightning, what would happen is extremely powerful earthquakes and also very feeble ones, can we get rid of the common cold if we all stayed away from each other for 2 weeks, is it feasible to move all of mankind off Earth....etc.....A few of the questions selected for detailed explanations could have been better though. Overall, a great book, it is fun reading if you like science!"
462,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by actor Wil Wheaton who made the book more enjoyable to listen to with his humorous narration.This is a science book containing absurd, funny and weird questions that people have asked the author, Randall Munroe, on his very popular webcomic site, xkcd.com. He goes into much detail and different scenarios after he painstakingly answers these hypothetical questions. For example: How long would it take you to find another person on the earth if you were the only two on the planet? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humans live? You get the idea. I definitely recommend this for all the science geeks out there. It was fun to listen to while driving and a nice break from the norm. 4 stars. "

Whatever the reason, this book was able to make me laugh and keep my eyes wide with wonder through almost every page. The questions are delightful, if absurd. For example: If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color? Or, Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward-firing machine guns? One of my favorites: What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?The answers take each question seriously and bring in the relevant science. The accompanying cartoons are delightful."

For those that aren't the majority of these What if? questions aren't so much answered as turned up to 11 and then answered.For those looking for structure and a coherent theme, I would not recommend this book, but for those with a mad sense of humour, this might just be what you're looking for (citation needed) "
465,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2068331-bee,3,"Interesting, engaging and thought-provoking with many a laugh.However, this is the first time in ages that I really wish I had read this as a book, not listened to the audiobook. I don't mind Wil Wheaton as a narrator, he's not at all the best I've heard (and I think that maybe he thinks he is...) but he's adequate. However he was not the best choice for this book. I've heard Randall Munroe talk, and Wil Wheaton (to my ears) makes him sounds incredibly arrogant and condescending. That being said, I really enjoyed the book and the myriad interesting questions. "

469,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5115519-mohamed-ibrahim,4,A wonderful book that gives you a very good scientific meal in a simple way. I knew more about things that I don't usually like or try to understand like biology while reading this book.
470,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19072481-s-baqer-al-meshqab,4,"Interested in Science? Want some Comedy? Here you go, this book is for you. What if? will give you some great laughs accompanied by unusual pieces of information. The book contains a lot of weird questions (makes me want to submit questions of my own too), in which you will definitely not show the same amount of interest, but some things in there will surely intrigue you.There are two drawbacks which made me drop the last star:1.0 The questions are way too randomly organized (mostly). Because the book has so many questions about so many topics, reading about different ideas may not be very comfortable to all readers (this is science we are talking about, even if it has been lightened). I would have suggested (as I do with these kinds of books) to collect the similar questions (or these of the same science field) to be in sequence (It will not fully work but still I think it will make it better). ex. questions about space, or about earth atmosphere, or about statistics. 2.0 The book doesn't take into consideration that not all readers have scientific background. The author tries to explain some things in advance, but not everything (he may need double the amount of paper and ink, but well, that would be the right way to do it, wouldn't it?)In general, I enjoyed reading the book, as it made me search things out. I am sure not everything will stick in my mind, but something will. The way of writing and sketches are really funny which lightened the mood. I loved most: What would happen if you build the actual periodic table?What if you have a mole (Avogadro Number) of moles?Can we really add more light to the moon by flashing laser pointers at it?What if we drained the oceans and send the water to Mars?What if the sun suddenly goes out?The hairdryer in the box.Self-Fertilizing (even though it was a little bit difficult to understand).and So many others.Very Recommended. It could be your gateway to Science. Science cannot be fun is a Myth. "

The questions raised are downright silly, and you can just picture a dorm room party where they are conceived. Even so, the author demonstrates some solid problem solving skills to give an approximation or simulation of a likely scenario. There is nothing like hypothetical problem solving to under stand the difference between really big numbers and really big compounded numbers. Question - if all the humans on earth could gather in one spot, what US state could they all fit in?a) Rhode Islandb) Indianac) Oregond) TexasThe answer is (view spoiler)[a) Rhode Island (hide spoiler)]. While that may seem surprising at first, it's a pretty simple problem to figure. (view spoiler)[ World population ~ 7 billionAssume 1 person takes 1 square foot (sorry, I am American and my mental math works best in imperial units)7 billion square feet ~ 251 square milesConsult Wikipedia for the areal size of the US states http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_...Viola, question answered (hide spoiler)]Silliness aside, it is important to be able to puzzle through these things and understand what the magnitude of a number means. Ignorance is not bliss, but advertisers and politicians are hoping you remain in the dark. Along those lines, the author indirectly teaches healthy skepticism of facts and figures found on the internet.[citation needed]"
472,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"What If? is a fun outing in which the author of xkcd answers weird science questions while ignoring the implausibility of those situations ever arising. So we get things like “what if all the rain from a cloud fell in one big droplet” and “what if Earth started expanding” — and Munroe answers them, rummaging through scientific papers and obscure experimental results to find out his closest guess at what would happen. I can’t really speak for his science in most places (only the DNA question was really down my street), but given how pedantic the internet can be, I’m sure Munroe did his absolute best to find an answer that would be, if not incontestable, at least not easily dismissed.The whole thing is illustrated with Munroe’s usual stick figures, and I still remain completely baffled as to how the combination of his stick figures and his lettering can imbue things with feeling. It makes no sense. And yet the Moon promising to help the Earth start spinning again? Gah. Moon, I love you!He also has a humorous tone and a clear way of explaining, so despite the weird situations that he examines, it pretty much all makes sense… though I took his equations for granted, and any other calculations.Originally reviewed on my blog."
473,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30425116-benny-lewis,5,"Excellent! Randall (online comic artist behind XKCD) delivers in book form as well as he does visually. He tackles silly questions and gives genuine scientifically valid answers. On occasion he allows magic to first initiate something like a baseball being launched at 0.9 times the speed of light from a pitcher's hands, but promptly returns to actual physical rules of the universe.I learned quite a lot (and I have quite an ample scientific background) and genuinely laughed out loud on several occasions. His style of humour just fits perfectly, and he delivers a punchline in a way you'd never expect from a scientific explanation.Just excellent. Anyone with a moderate interest in science should get this book for a really enjoyable read. And it includes plenty of drawings to keep XKCD fans satisfied. "

I may never use (or even remember, for that matter) any of the facts mentioned in the book, but I had great fun, laugh-out-loud fun, and I was sorry to see the book end so soon. In the author's words,“They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about [whether there are more hard or soft things in the world], for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”I did go many interesting places with him, and while I'm sorry to have missed the illustrations in the printed edition of the book, I think the narrator was just as awesome as the books deserves."

480,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,2,"So, hey, I get it, it's pretty funny. But when the sub-title to this book has the phrase ""Serious Scientific Answers"" and then 90% of the answers precis with ""let's first ignore the physics of Earth to answer this questions about something relating to the physics of light,"" I wonder how ""serious"" it really is. And it also gets a little tiresome because while the humor is pretty good, the tone and tenor is exceptionally single-note. There's some hearty guffaws and hoots and knee-slaps to be had, but at the end the questions are thin ""OMG SO RANDOM!!!!,"" and you can tell many of the submissions were people reaching a tad too hard for the absurd, wanting to be included in the book--ie. they're absurd for no real value than giggles.Times reminded me of that television show Mythbusters where the basic scientific principal behind the ""myth,"" or, in this case, the ""absurd question,"" is presented in a fairly straightforward way in approximately 2 sentences. Then, the proceeding 3-5 pages was jocular ""serious science"" that ""ignored"" the realities of physical possibility for the sake of comedy. Maybe I'm being to hard on it for being a comical book. But as a book of comedy, then shouldn't it offer more than just ""goofy"" as it's comic device? There's some great slapstick. Funny moments of the absurd. But halfway through, I was met with disinterest, slogging through. I was even reading this thing at a leisurely pace over the course of the past month or so.I've enjoyed Munroe's webcomic presence since I first discovered it sometime around 2010, but somehow seeing it laid bare, page after page exposed its thin fragility. How simplistic it really is, hiding behind a veil of scientific jargon and goofy-absurd premises. The book gave pleasure and entertainment, but not a sustained sensation of either. Perhaps best served as a ""coffee table book"" left to be dipped into randomly rather than read cover to cover, even if over the course of several weeks."
481,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,5,"Let me cut right to the chase and say that this is the kind of book that could change the trajectory of someone's life if you got it in the right hands at the right time.I sent copies to my nieces and nephews and to the families in my daughter's playgroup that we're still in regular touch with. I'm debating giving copies out for Halloween this year. I'll buy a copy for your kid if he or she (especially she) wants one.If you are already familiar with http://what-if.xkcd.com/ then you know what this book is like: Sort of a Straight Dope meets Richard Feynman deal in which outlandish questions are answered with heaps of playful speculation, physics, math, and whatnot.I bought this book for Matt, but I read it in one sitting. It reminded me of everything I liked about my math and science classes growing up, especially the playfulness and creativity of learning things and then applying them to different problems.The questions are very silly, by the way, almost to the point of being inconsequential. (Examples: What if everyone pointed a laser pointer at the moon? What if the Earth stopped rotating? What if you had a mole [the number] of moles [the animal]?) But that's part of what makes the answers so great. There are some questions that even Mr. Munroe refuses to answer, which are also lovingly captured.When I tossed the book to Matt, he saw the cartoon of a T. Rex being lowered into a Sarlacc via a crane and said cool. The next day he was excited to talk with me about baseballs going at relativistic speeds.Highly recommended. Matt just told me that he would give it 5 stars, too. Reviews coming in from around the country have been uniformly positive, too."
482,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7233842-jaksen,5,"A great book, however you must THINK to appreciate it. It also helps to have somewhat of a scientific background, or interest.(Former science teacher here of 35 years.)As I read this book - and some parts I skimmed over - I remembered students doing this to me. In a perfectly ordinary classroom discussion, after a perfectly ordinary lab experiment - like separating HCl (using zinc mossy) into H and zinc chloride, for example, and blowing up the H gas in long test tubes to shrieks of delight and omg can we do this AGAIN! (And we did, until I ran out of supplies. I was always buying stuff for school, it seems,) someone, usually a boy (sexist me) would say, Can we...what would happen if we...Substituted nitric acid. Used tin or aluminum. Did this outside in a giant balloon. Filled up my stepdad's car with H gas and lit it. And on and on ...I called these stupid questions and everyone would laugh, then I'd try to answer as best I could, but often I'd say, well, I don't have enough information to know what would - if we did - and it would be VERY dangerous - and DON'T do this at home.(I did have one student who duplicated many of our classroom experiments at home. He's now a nuclear physicist, so go figure.)Enough about me! This book was GREAT! I loved it. I read most of it - the chemistry and few biology sections were the most familiar to me. And the occasional volcano question. Physics I can follow unless it gets toooo deeeep, but Mr. Munroe has a way of explaining things that is never 'talking down' or dumbing down the info. The questions might be silly, stupid, or often ludicrous, but the answers? Pure genius."

The book is exactly what it says it is and the author goes and answers each questions but even goes beyond that. It can get super detailed and specific and he continues to add onto the scenarios. It got a bit too science-y for ME because I don't know that much about physics and chemistry so some of the deeper dives lost me a bit. But overall a fun listen. "

I was in a non-fiction reading slump before picking this up, because the non-fiction books I've attempted to read previously have been so dry and boring with massively long chapters that seem to get way off-point.As a scientist, I love learning about everything; the science of life, of how skyscrapers don't fall down, of why siblings fight all the time. But because I'm at university, science books often feel like work rather than a break from work. What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions came nowhere near giving me this feeling. This book is witty and well-written. It made me laugh multiple times over. It's also extremely educational, as it applies real-world science to very weird scenarios, as the title suggests. The science behind the explanations is very simply explained. Sure, the questions people have asked are probably never going to happen, and some of them are scientifically impossible, but the science behind it is the same. The cartoons are funny and offer some serious comic relief to what is already a hilarious book.One line that sticks with me as a chemistry major is this: ""There is no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word 'NO' scrawled over and over in charred blood."" I just laughed too much at this, because material safety data sheets are the bane of my existence sometimes, and it was just so relatable. I showed it to my chemistry friends, and they also loved it. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science, even in the smallest way."
491,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"The title of the book says it all - the science is well researched and there are serious answers to a variety of hypothetical (and largely irrelevant considering their feasibility). At times the science gets to be a little too detailed for casual reading. There is a touch of humour which runs through most of the questions which make for great reading. For instance, to a question on what would be the consequences to Earth in case the sun dies - Randall launches into a detailed explanation of all the positives, and finally ends by saying that we would all be dead though and not in a position to reap any of the mentioned benefits.There are a number of interesting questions such as - when would facebook have more dead people than living, what happens if you are caught up in lightning, what would happen is extremely powerful earthquakes and also very feeble ones, can we get rid of the common cold if we all stayed away from each other for 2 weeks, is it feasible to move all of mankind off Earth....etc.....A few of the questions selected for detailed explanations could have been better though. Overall, a great book, it is fun reading if you like science!"
492,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by actor Wil Wheaton who made the book more enjoyable to listen to with his humorous narration.This is a science book containing absurd, funny and weird questions that people have asked the author, Randall Munroe, on his very popular webcomic site, xkcd.com. He goes into much detail and different scenarios after he painstakingly answers these hypothetical questions. For example: How long would it take you to find another person on the earth if you were the only two on the planet? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humans live? You get the idea. I definitely recommend this for all the science geeks out there. It was fun to listen to while driving and a nice break from the norm. 4 stars. "

Whatever the reason, this book was able to make me laugh and keep my eyes wide with wonder through almost every page. The questions are delightful, if absurd. For example: If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color? Or, Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward-firing machine guns? One of my favorites: What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?The answers take each question seriously and bring in the relevant science. The accompanying cartoons are delightful."

For those that aren't the majority of these What if? questions aren't so much answered as turned up to 11 and then answered.For those looking for structure and a coherent theme, I would not recommend this book, but for those with a mad sense of humour, this might just be what you're looking for (citation needed) "

I don't mind Wil Wheaton as a narrator, he's not at all the best I've heard (and I think that maybe he thinks he is...) but he's adequate. However he was not the best choice for this book. I've heard Randall Munroe talk, and Wil Wheaton (to my ears) makes him sounds incredibly arrogant and condescending. That being said, I really enjoyed the book and the myriad interesting questions. "

What if? will give you some great laughs accompanied by unusual pieces of information. The book contains a lot of weird questions (makes me want to submit questions of my own too), in which you will definitely not show the same amount of interest, but some things in there will surely intrigue you.There are two drawbacks which made me drop the last star:1.0 The questions are way too randomly organized (mostly). Because the book has so many questions about so many topics, reading about different ideas may not be very comfortable to all readers (this is science we are talking about, even if it has been lightened). I would have suggested (as I do with these kinds of books) to collect the similar questions (or these of the same science field) to be in sequence (It will not fully work but still I think it will make it better). ex. questions about space, or about earth atmosphere, or about statistics. 2.0 The book doesn't take into consideration that not all readers have scientific background. The author tries to explain some things in advance, but not everything (he may need double the amount of paper and ink, but well, that would be the right way to do it, wouldn't it?)In general, I enjoyed reading the book, as it made me search things out. I am sure not everything will stick in my mind, but something will. The way of writing and sketches are really funny which lightened the mood. I loved most: What would happen if you build the actual periodic table?What if you have a mole (Avogadro Number) of moles?Can we really add more light to the moon by flashing laser pointers at it?What if we drained the oceans and send the water to Mars?What if the sun suddenly goes out?The hairdryer in the box.Self-Fertilizing (even though it was a little bit difficult to understand).and So many others.Very Recommended. It could be your gateway to Science. Science cannot be fun is a Myth. "
501,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8316749-katiemc,4,"Recommended for mental math and http://xkcd.com/ fans. The questions raised are downright silly, and you can just picture a dorm room party where they are conceived. Even so, the author demonstrates some solid problem solving skills to give an approximation or simulation of a likely scenario. There is nothing like hypothetical problem solving to under stand the difference between really big numbers and really big compounded numbers. Question - if all the humans on earth could gather in one spot, what US state could they all fit in?a) Rhode Islandb) Indianac) Oregond) TexasThe answer is (view spoiler)[a) Rhode Island (hide spoiler)]. While that may seem surprising at first, it's a pretty simple problem to figure. (view spoiler)[ World population ~ 7 billionAssume 1 person takes 1 square foot (sorry, I am American and my mental math works best in imperial units)7 billion square feet ~ 251 square milesConsult Wikipedia for the areal size of the US states http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_...Viola, question answered (hide spoiler)]Silliness aside, it is important to be able to puzzle through these things and understand what the magnitude of a number means. Ignorance is not bliss, but advertisers and politicians are hoping you remain in the dark. Along those lines, the author indirectly teaches healthy skepticism of facts and figures found on the internet.[citation needed]"
502,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"What If? is a fun outing in which the author of xkcd answers weird science questions while ignoring the implausibility of those situations ever arising. So we get things like “what if all the rain from a cloud fell in one big droplet” and “what if Earth started expanding” — and Munroe answers them, rummaging through scientific papers and obscure experimental results to find out his closest guess at what would happen. I can’t really speak for his science in most places (only the DNA question was really down my street), but given how pedantic the internet can be, I’m sure Munroe did his absolute best to find an answer that would be, if not incontestable, at least not easily dismissed.The whole thing is illustrated with Munroe’s usual stick figures, and I still remain completely baffled as to how the combination of his stick figures and his lettering can imbue things with feeling. It makes no sense. And yet the Moon promising to help the Earth start spinning again? Gah. Moon, I love you!He also has a humorous tone and a clear way of explaining, so despite the weird situations that he examines, it pretty much all makes sense… though I took his equations for granted, and any other calculations.Originally reviewed on my blog."
503,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30425116-benny-lewis,5,"Excellent! Randall (online comic artist behind XKCD) delivers in book form as well as he does visually. He tackles silly questions and gives genuine scientifically valid answers. On occasion he allows magic to first initiate something like a baseball being launched at 0.9 times the speed of light from a pitcher's hands, but promptly returns to actual physical rules of the universe.I learned quite a lot (and I have quite an ample scientific background) and genuinely laughed out loud on several occasions. His style of humour just fits perfectly, and he delivers a punchline in a way you'd never expect from a scientific explanation.Just excellent. Anyone with a moderate interest in science should get this book for a really enjoyable read. And it includes plenty of drawings to keep XKCD fans satisfied. "

I may never use (or even remember, for that matter) any of the facts mentioned in the book, but I had great fun, laugh-out-loud fun, and I was sorry to see the book end so soon. In the author's words,“They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about [whether there are more hard or soft things in the world], for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”I did go many interesting places with him, and while I'm sorry to have missed the illustrations in the printed edition of the book, I think the narrator was just as awesome as the books deserves."
505,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"Lots of fun to read and quite humorous, too. The absurd questions and their (potential in most cases) answers are interesting, entertaining and sometimes educational. The absurdity of the questions were fun to read and think about. For example, what would happen if a drain opened at the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean and drained out. Absurd, yes, but the answer is interesting to contemplate. A fun read.

The author had shown me at what speed would it take to burn a ball, he showed me how strong a bullet would be if it was as heavy as a neutron star. Every two to three questions he'll add a section about worrying questions where it's questions that are useless to answer. This book is definitely worth the time to read."

This book is good in lots of different ways like it's sometimes funny, and sometimes it makes you wonder, ""how?"" ""why?"" I would recommend this book to people who love science."
510,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,2,"So, hey, I get it, it's pretty funny. But when the sub-title to this book has the phrase ""Serious Scientific Answers"" and then 90% of the answers precis with ""let's first ignore the physics of Earth to answer this questions about something relating to the physics of light,"" I wonder how ""serious"" it really is. And it also gets a little tiresome because while the humor is pretty good, the tone and tenor is exceptionally single-note. There's some hearty guffaws and hoots and knee-slaps to be had, but at the end the questions are thin ""OMG SO RANDOM!!!!,"" and you can tell many of the submissions were people reaching a tad too hard for the absurd, wanting to be included in the book--ie. they're absurd for no real value than giggles.Times reminded me of that television show Mythbusters where the basic scientific principal behind the ""myth,"" or, in this case, the ""absurd question,"" is presented in a fairly straightforward way in approximately 2 sentences. Then, the proceeding 3-5 pages was jocular ""serious science"" that ""ignored"" the realities of physical possibility for the sake of comedy. Maybe I'm being to hard on it for being a comical book. But as a book of comedy, then shouldn't it offer more than just ""goofy"" as it's comic device? There's some great slapstick. Funny moments of the absurd. But halfway through, I was met with disinterest, slogging through. I was even reading this thing at a leisurely pace over the course of the past month or so.I've enjoyed Munroe's webcomic presence since I first discovered it sometime around 2010, but somehow seeing it laid bare, page after page exposed its thin fragility. How simplistic it really is, hiding behind a veil of scientific jargon and goofy-absurd premises. The book gave pleasure and entertainment, but not a sustained sensation of either. Perhaps best served as a ""coffee table book"" left to be dipped into randomly rather than read cover to cover, even if over the course of several weeks."
511,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,5,"Let me cut right to the chase and say that this is the kind of book that could change the trajectory of someone's life if you got it in the right hands at the right time.I sent copies to my nieces and nephews and to the families in my daughter's playgroup that we're still in regular touch with. I'm debating giving copies out for Halloween this year. I'll buy a copy for your kid if he or she (especially she) wants one.If you are already familiar with http://what-if.xkcd.com/ then you know what this book is like: Sort of a Straight Dope meets Richard Feynman deal in which outlandish questions are answered with heaps of playful speculation, physics, math, and whatnot.I bought this book for Matt, but I read it in one sitting. It reminded me of everything I liked about my math and science classes growing up, especially the playfulness and creativity of learning things and then applying them to different problems.The questions are very silly, by the way, almost to the point of being inconsequential. (Examples: What if everyone pointed a laser pointer at the moon? What if the Earth stopped rotating? What if you had a mole [the number] of moles [the animal]?) But that's part of what makes the answers so great. There are some questions that even Mr. Munroe refuses to answer, which are also lovingly captured.When I tossed the book to Matt, he saw the cartoon of a T. Rex being lowered into a Sarlacc via a crane and said cool. The next day he was excited to talk with me about baseballs going at relativistic speeds.Highly recommended. Matt just told me that he would give it 5 stars, too. Reviews coming in from around the country have been uniformly positive, too."
512,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7233842-jaksen,5,"A great book, however you must THINK to appreciate it. It also helps to have somewhat of a scientific background, or interest.(Former science teacher here of 35 years.)As I read this book - and some parts I skimmed over - I remembered students doing this to me. In a perfectly ordinary classroom discussion, after a perfectly ordinary lab experiment - like separating HCl (using zinc mossy) into H and zinc chloride, for example, and blowing up the H gas in long test tubes to shrieks of delight and omg can we do this AGAIN! (And we did, until I ran out of supplies. I was always buying stuff for school, it seems,) someone, usually a boy (sexist me) would say, Can we...what would happen if we...Substituted nitric acid. Used tin or aluminum. Did this outside in a giant balloon. Filled up my stepdad's car with H gas and lit it. And on and on ...I called these stupid questions and everyone would laugh, then I'd try to answer as best I could, but often I'd say, well, I don't have enough information to know what would - if we did - and it would be VERY dangerous - and DON'T do this at home.(I did have one student who duplicated many of our classroom experiments at home. He's now a nuclear physicist, so go figure.)Enough about me! This book was GREAT! I loved it. I read most of it - the chemistry and few biology sections were the most familiar to me. And the occasional volcano question. Physics I can follow unless it gets toooo deeeep, but Mr. Munroe has a way of explaining things that is never 'talking down' or dumbing down the info. The questions might be silly, stupid, or often ludicrous, but the answers? Pure genius."
513,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey,3,"Listened to this one on audiobook, which is narrated by Wil Wheaton. He was a great narrator and perfect for this book. The book is exactly what it says it is and the author goes and answers each questions but even goes beyond that. It can get super detailed and specific and he continues to add onto the scenarios. It got a bit too science-y for ME because I don't know that much about physics and chemistry so some of the deeper dives lost me a bit. But overall a fun listen. "

Well, he actually quit his job to start drawing cartoons at xkcd.com, so I don't know where his workspace is now... Frankly, covid-19 has me holed up in my basement most of the time now (it's where most of the books are, after all). Example of a comic found on his website: This book is informative, gleeful, and irreverent as Munroe goes about exploring questions as crazy as ""From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?"" or as strangly specific as ""How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean?"" Such questions have been gathered from Munroe's website, and the derivation of his thoroughly researched answers follows. You need to suspend your disbelief, take on some giant assumptions, and add some sanity by a combined form of physics (mostly), chemistry, and biology—what you get out of this book are weird but detailed answers that make you raise your eyebrows, laugh, or both.

This particular book, however, was not a bad read. People have really outdone themselves sending in really weird questions. And the author, on his part, has sometimes gone out of the way to give decent and comprehensible answers. It helps that the book has short chapters and you can pick it up anytime and read any one of them. It might give you some weird insights to impress your friends at the next party. Was it funny? I'd say yes. But more than once I felt that the footnotes were the funniest (however, I'm not sure everyone would get the humor). How much do I remember? Sorry, but not much.

For instance, to a question on what would be the consequences to Earth in case the sun dies - Randall launches into a detailed explanation of all the positives, and finally ends by saying that we would all be dead though and not in a position to reap any of the mentioned benefits.There are a number of interesting questions such as - when would facebook have more dead people than living, what happens if you are caught up in lightning, what would happen is extremely powerful earthquakes and also very feeble ones, can we get rid of the common cold if we all stayed away from each other for 2 weeks, is it feasible to move all of mankind off Earth....etc.....A few of the questions selected for detailed explanations could have been better though.

For example: How long would it take you to find another person on the earth if you were the only two on the planet? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humans live? You get the idea. I definitely recommend this for all the science geeks out there.

What if? will give you some great laughs accompanied by unusual pieces of information. The book contains a lot of weird questions (makes me want to submit questions of my own too), in which you will definitely not show the same amount of interest, but some things in there will surely intrigue you.There are two drawbacks which made me drop the last star:1.0 The questions are way too randomly organized (mostly). Because the book has so many questions about so many topics, reading about different ideas may not be very comfortable to all readers (this is science we are talking about, even if it has been lightened). I would have suggested (as I do with these kinds of books) to collect the similar questions (or these of the same science field) to be in sequence (It will not fully work but still I think it will make it better). ex. questions about space, or about earth atmosphere, or about statistics. 2.0 The book doesn't take into consideration that not all readers have scientific background. The author tries to explain some things in advance, but not everything (he may need double the amount of paper and ink, but well, that would be the right way to do it, wouldn't it?)In general, I enjoyed reading the book, as it made me search things out. I am sure not everything will stick in my mind, but something will. The way of writing and sketches are really funny which lightened the mood. I loved most: What would happen if you build the actual periodic table?What if you have a mole (Avogadro Number) of moles?Can we really add more light to the moon by flashing laser pointers at it?What if we drained the oceans and send the water to Mars?What if the sun suddenly goes out?The hairdryer in the box.Self-Fertilizing (even though it was a little bit difficult to understand).and So many others.Very Recommended. It could be your gateway to Science. Science cannot be fun is a Myth. "

The questions raised are downright silly, and you can just picture a dorm room party where they are conceived. Even so, the author demonstrates some solid problem solving skills to give an approximation or simulation of a likely scenario. There is nothing like hypothetical problem solving to under stand the difference between really big numbers and really big compounded numbers. Question - if all the humans on earth could gather in one spot, what US state could they all fit in?a) Rhode Islandb) Indianac) Oregond) TexasThe answer is (view spoiler)[a) Rhode Island (hide spoiler)]. While that may seem surprising at first, it's a pretty simple problem to figure. (view spoiler)[ World population ~ 7 billionAssume 1 person takes 1 square foot (sorry, I am American and my mental math works best in imperial units)7 billion square feet ~ 251 square milesConsult Wikipedia for the areal size of the US states http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_...Viola, question answered (hide spoiler)]Silliness aside, it is important to be able to puzzle through these things and understand what the magnitude of a number means. Ignorance is not bliss, but advertisers and politicians are hoping you remain in the dark. Along those lines, the author indirectly teaches healthy skepticism of facts and figures found on the internet.[citation needed]"
532,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"What If? is a fun outing in which the author of xkcd answers weird science questions while ignoring the implausibility of those situations ever arising. So we get things like “what if all the rain from a cloud fell in one big droplet” and “what if Earth started expanding” — and Munroe answers them, rummaging through scientific papers and obscure experimental results to find out his closest guess at what would happen. I can’t really speak for his science in most places (only the DNA question was really down my street), but given how pedantic the internet can be, I’m sure Munroe did his absolute best to find an answer that would be, if not incontestable, at least not easily dismissed.The whole thing is illustrated with Munroe’s usual stick figures, and I still remain completely baffled as to how the combination of his stick figures and his lettering can imbue things with feeling. It makes no sense. And yet the Moon promising to help the Earth start spinning again? Gah. Moon, I love you!He also has a humorous tone and a clear way of explaining, so despite the weird situations that he examines, it pretty much all makes sense… though I took his equations for granted, and any other calculations.Originally reviewed on my blog."

He tackles silly questions and gives genuine scientifically valid answers. On occasion he allows magic to first initiate something like a baseball being launched at 0.9 times the speed of light from a pitcher's hands, but promptly returns to actual physical rules of the universe.I learned quite a lot (and I have quite an ample scientific background) and genuinely laughed out loud on several occasions. His style of humour just fits perfectly, and he delivers a punchline in a way you'd never expect from a scientific explanation.Just excellent. Anyone with a moderate interest in science should get this book for a really enjoyable read. And it includes plenty of drawings to keep XKCD fans satisfied. "

I may never use (or even remember, for that matter) any of the facts mentioned in the book, but I had great fun, laugh-out-loud fun, and I was sorry to see the book end so soon. In the author's words,“They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about [whether there are more hard or soft things in the world], for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”I did go many interesting places with him, and while I'm sorry to have missed the illustrations in the printed edition of the book, I think the narrator was just as awesome as the books deserves."

540,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,2,"So, hey, I get it, it's pretty funny. But when the sub-title to this book has the phrase ""Serious Scientific Answers"" and then 90% of the answers precis with ""let's first ignore the physics of Earth to answer this questions about something relating to the physics of light,"" I wonder how ""serious"" it really is. And it also gets a little tiresome because while the humor is pretty good, the tone and tenor is exceptionally single-note. There's some hearty guffaws and hoots and knee-slaps to be had, but at the end the questions are thin ""OMG SO RANDOM!!!!,"" and you can tell many of the submissions were people reaching a tad too hard for the absurd, wanting to be included in the book--ie. they're absurd for no real value than giggles.Times reminded me of that television show Mythbusters where the basic scientific principal behind the ""myth,"" or, in this case, the ""absurd question,"" is presented in a fairly straightforward way in approximately 2 sentences. Then, the proceeding 3-5 pages was jocular ""serious science"" that ""ignored"" the realities of physical possibility for the sake of comedy. Maybe I'm being to hard on it for being a comical book. But as a book of comedy, then shouldn't it offer more than just ""goofy"" as it's comic device? There's some great slapstick. Funny moments of the absurd. But halfway through, I was met with disinterest, slogging through. I was even reading this thing at a leisurely pace over the course of the past month or so.I've enjoyed Munroe's webcomic presence since I first discovered it sometime around 2010, but somehow seeing it laid bare, page after page exposed its thin fragility. How simplistic it really is, hiding behind a veil of scientific jargon and goofy-absurd premises. The book gave pleasure and entertainment, but not a sustained sensation of either. Perhaps best served as a ""coffee table book"" left to be dipped into randomly rather than read cover to cover, even if over the course of several weeks."

I'm debating giving copies out for Halloween this year. I'll buy a copy for your kid if he or she (especially she) wants one.If you are already familiar with http://what-if.xkcd.com/ then you know what this book is like: Sort of a Straight Dope meets Richard Feynman deal in which outlandish questions are answered with heaps of playful speculation, physics, math, and whatnot.I bought this book for Matt, but I read it in one sitting. It reminded me of everything I liked about my math and science classes growing up, especially the playfulness and creativity of learning things and then applying them to different problems.The questions are very silly, by the way, almost to the point of being inconsequential. (Examples: What if everyone pointed a laser pointer at the moon? What if the Earth stopped rotating? What if you had a mole [the number] of moles [the animal]?) But that's part of what makes the answers so great. There are some questions that even Mr. Munroe refuses to answer, which are also lovingly captured.When I tossed the book to Matt, he saw the cartoon of a T. Rex being lowered into a Sarlacc via a crane and said cool. The next day he was excited to talk with me about baseballs going at relativistic speeds.Highly recommended. Matt just told me that he would give it 5 stars, too. Reviews coming in from around the country have been uniformly positive, too."
542,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7233842-jaksen,5,"A great book, however you must THINK to appreciate it. It also helps to have somewhat of a scientific background, or interest.(Former science teacher here of 35 years.)As I read this book - and some parts I skimmed over - I remembered students doing this to me. In a perfectly ordinary classroom discussion, after a perfectly ordinary lab experiment - like separating HCl (using zinc mossy) into H and zinc chloride, for example, and blowing up the H gas in long test tubes to shrieks of delight and omg can we do this AGAIN! (And we did, until I ran out of supplies. I was always buying stuff for school, it seems,) someone, usually a boy (sexist me) would say, Can we...what would happen if we...Substituted nitric acid. Used tin or aluminum. Did this outside in a giant balloon. Filled up my stepdad's car with H gas and lit it. And on and on ...I called these stupid questions and everyone would laugh, then I'd try to answer as best I could, but often I'd say, well, I don't have enough information to know what would - if we did - and it would be VERY dangerous - and DON'T do this at home.(I did have one student who duplicated many of our classroom experiments at home. He's now a nuclear physicist, so go figure.)Enough about me! This book was GREAT! I loved it. I read most of it - the chemistry and few biology sections were the most familiar to me. And the occasional volcano question. Physics I can follow unless it gets toooo deeeep, but Mr. Munroe has a way of explaining things that is never 'talking down' or dumbing down the info. The questions might be silly, stupid, or often ludicrous, but the answers? Pure genius."

The book is exactly what it says it is and the author goes and answers each questions but even goes beyond that. It can get super detailed and specific and he continues to add onto the scenarios. It got a bit too science-y for ME because I don't know that much about physics and chemistry so some of the deeper dives lost me a bit. But overall a fun listen. "

Well, he actually quit his job to start drawing cartoons at xkcd.com, so I don't know where his workspace is now... Frankly, covid-19 has me holed up in my basement most of the time now (it's where most of the books are, after all). Example of a comic found on his website: This book is informative, gleeful, and irreverent as Munroe goes about exploring questions as crazy as ""From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?"" or as strangly specific as ""How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean?"" Such questions have been gathered from Munroe's website, and the derivation of his thoroughly researched answers follows. You need to suspend your disbelief, take on some giant assumptions, and add some sanity by a combined form of physics (mostly), chemistry, and biology—what you get out of this book are weird but detailed answers that make you raise your eyebrows, laugh, or both. It's fast and fun, easy to devour in one sitting but just as easy to put down and come back to at no great loss. What more could you want?"

This particular book, however, was not a bad read. People have really outdone themselves sending in really weird questions. And the author, on his part, has sometimes gone out of the way to give decent and comprehensible answers. It helps that the book has short chapters and you can pick it up anytime and read any one of them. It might give you some weird insights to impress your friends at the next party. Was it funny? I'd say yes. But more than once I felt that the footnotes were the funniest (however, I'm not sure everyone would get the humor). How much do I remember? Sorry, but not much. I guess, it just means that I can pick it up again in a little while and re-read some bits. Illustrations were great, though. And I liked that it didn't focus just on physics."

Dressed in spandex tights with glaringly bright red underwear worn atop my trousers and a billowing red cape, I shall fly faster than a speeding bullet into the stratospehere. But from a biological POV since I am not an alien the atmosphere would kill me pretty quickly. I have always wondered if the cold would kill me first or the lack of air would.

(Note to self : It is always better to imagine yourself as Iron Man for you can have a controlled environment inside the suit. Go Tony !)The author runs a very popular website named xkcd where he answers questions from the curious audience with the aid of science and mathematics. The book is a collection of some of the most popular questions posted on the website along with their scientific answers. Some of the questions might appear to be too absurd but here is what the author thinks of them :They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about hard and soft things, for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying thoroughly to answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.If text books were written in such a fashion, I wouldn’t have had selective amnesia about my physics class. Ah well, it’s never too late to discover books that can show you the right path. If you are a geek god like Patrick Rothfuss who tore through the entire book in two nights then the book wouldn’t overwhelm you. However, if you prefer spending some time mulling over the ideas and setting them down firmly in your mind then it would be better to break this down into chapters and read over a few days.

It's also extremely educational, as it applies real-world science to very weird scenarios, as the title suggests. The science behind the explanations is very simply explained. Sure, the questions people have asked are probably never going to happen, and some of them are scientifically impossible, but the science behind it is the same.

The book contains a lot of weird questions (makes me want to submit questions of my own too), in which you will definitely not show the same amount of interest, but some things in there will surely intrigue you.There are two drawbacks which made me drop the last star:1.0 The questions are way too randomly organized (mostly). Because the book has so many questions about so many topics, reading about different ideas may not be very comfortable to all readers (this is science we are talking about, even if it has been lightened).

The author tries to explain some things in advance, but not everything (he may need double the amount of paper and ink, but well, that would be the right way to do it, wouldn't it?)In general, I enjoyed reading the book, as it made me search things out. I am sure not everything will stick in my mind, but something will. The way of writing and sketches are really funny which lightened the mood.

562,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"What If? is a fun outing in which the author of xkcd answers weird science questions while ignoring the implausibility of those situations ever arising. So we get things like “what if all the rain from a cloud fell in one big droplet” and “what if Earth started expanding” — and Munroe answers them, rummaging through scientific papers and obscure experimental results to find out his closest guess at what would happen. I can’t really speak for his science in most places (only the DNA question was really down my street), but given how pedantic the internet can be, I’m sure Munroe did his absolute best to find an answer that would be, if not incontestable, at least not easily dismissed.The whole thing is illustrated with Munroe’s usual stick figures, and I still remain completely baffled as to how the combination of his stick figures and his lettering can imbue things with feeling. It makes no sense. And yet the Moon promising to help the Earth start spinning again? Gah. Moon, I love you!He also has a humorous tone and a clear way of explaining, so despite the weird situations that he examines, it pretty much all makes sense… though I took his equations for granted, and any other calculations.Originally reviewed on my blog."

He tackles silly questions and gives genuine scientifically valid answers. On occasion he allows magic to first initiate something like a baseball being launched at 0.9 times the speed of light from a pitcher's hands, but promptly returns to actual physical rules of the universe.I learned quite a lot (and I have quite an ample scientific background) and genuinely laughed out loud on several occasions. His style of humour just fits perfectly, and he delivers a punchline in a way you'd never expect from a scientific explanation.Just excellent.

In the author's words,“They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about [whether there are more hard or soft things in the world], for example, is pretty stupid.

This book is good in lots of different ways like it's sometimes funny, and sometimes it makes you wonder, ""how?"" ""why?"" I would recommend this book to people who love science."
570,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,2,"So, hey, I get it, it's pretty funny. But when the sub-title to this book has the phrase ""Serious Scientific Answers"" and then 90% of the answers precis with ""let's first ignore the physics of Earth to answer this questions about something relating to the physics of light,"" I wonder how ""serious"" it really is. And it also gets a little tiresome because while the humor is pretty good, the tone and tenor is exceptionally single-note. There's some hearty guffaws and hoots and knee-slaps to be had, but at the end the questions are thin ""OMG SO RANDOM!!!!,"" and you can tell many of the submissions were people reaching a tad too hard for the absurd, wanting to be included in the book--ie. they're absurd for no real value than giggles.Times reminded me of that television show Mythbusters where the basic scientific principal behind the ""myth,"" or, in this case, the ""absurd question,"" is presented in a fairly straightforward way in approximately 2 sentences. Then, the proceeding 3-5 pages was jocular ""serious science"" that ""ignored"" the realities of physical possibility for the sake of comedy. Maybe I'm being to hard on it for being a comical book. But as a book of comedy, then shouldn't it offer more than just ""goofy"" as it's comic device? There's some great slapstick. Funny moments of the absurd. But halfway through, I was met with disinterest, slogging through. I was even reading this thing at a leisurely pace over the course of the past month or so.I've enjoyed Munroe's webcomic presence since I first discovered it sometime around 2010, but somehow seeing it laid bare, page after page exposed its thin fragility. How simplistic it really is, hiding behind a veil of scientific jargon and goofy-absurd premises. The book gave pleasure and entertainment, but not a sustained sensation of either. Perhaps best served as a ""coffee table book"" left to be dipped into randomly rather than read cover to cover, even if over the course of several weeks."

I'm debating giving copies out for Halloween this year. I'll buy a copy for your kid if he or she (especially she) wants one.If you are already familiar with http://what-if.xkcd.com/ then you know what this book is like: Sort of a Straight Dope meets Richard Feynman deal in which outlandish questions are answered with heaps of playful speculation, physics, math, and whatnot.I bought this book for Matt, but I read it in one sitting. It reminded me of everything I liked about my math and science classes growing up, especially the playfulness and creativity of learning things and then applying them to different problems.The questions are very silly, by the way, almost to the point of being inconsequential. (Examples: What if everyone pointed a laser pointer at the moon? What if the Earth stopped rotating? What if you had a mole [the number] of moles [the animal]?) But that's part of what makes the answers so great. There are some questions that even Mr. Munroe refuses to answer, which are also lovingly captured.When I tossed the book to Matt, he saw the cartoon of a T. Rex being lowered into a Sarlacc via a crane and said cool. The next day he was excited to talk with me about baseballs going at relativistic speeds.Highly recommended. Matt just told me that he would give it 5 stars, too. Reviews coming in from around the country have been uniformly positive, too."
572,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7233842-jaksen,5,"A great book, however you must THINK to appreciate it. It also helps to have somewhat of a scientific background, or interest.(Former science teacher here of 35 years.)As I read this book - and some parts I skimmed over - I remembered students doing this to me. In a perfectly ordinary classroom discussion, after a perfectly ordinary lab experiment - like separating HCl (using zinc mossy) into H and zinc chloride, for example, and blowing up the H gas in long test tubes to shrieks of delight and omg can we do this AGAIN! (And we did, until I ran out of supplies. I was always buying stuff for school, it seems,) someone, usually a boy (sexist me) would say, Can we...what would happen if we...Substituted nitric acid. Used tin or aluminum. Did this outside in a giant balloon. Filled up my stepdad's car with H gas and lit it. And on and on ...I called these stupid questions and everyone would laugh, then I'd try to answer as best I could, but often I'd say, well, I don't have enough information to know what would - if we did - and it would be VERY dangerous - and DON'T do this at home.(I did have one student who duplicated many of our classroom experiments at home. He's now a nuclear physicist, so go figure.)Enough about me! This book was GREAT! I loved it. I read most of it - the chemistry and few biology sections were the most familiar to me. And the occasional volcano question. Physics I can follow unless it gets toooo deeeep, but Mr. Munroe has a way of explaining things that is never 'talking down' or dumbing down the info. The questions might be silly, stupid, or often ludicrous, but the answers? Pure genius."
573,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey,3,"Listened to this one on audiobook, which is narrated by Wil Wheaton. He was a great narrator and perfect for this book. The book is exactly what it says it is and the author goes and answers each questions but even goes beyond that. It can get super detailed and specific and he continues to add onto the scenarios. It got a bit too science-y for ME because I don't know that much about physics and chemistry so some of the deeper dives lost me a bit. But overall a fun listen. "

Well, he actually quit his job to start drawing cartoons at xkcd.com, so I don't know where his workspace is now... Frankly, covid-19 has me holed up in my basement most of the time now (it's where most of the books are, after all). Example of a comic found on his website: This book is informative, gleeful, and irreverent as Munroe goes about exploring questions as crazy as ""From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?"" or as strangly specific as ""How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean?"" Such questions have been gathered from Munroe's website, and the derivation of his thoroughly researched answers follows. You need to suspend your disbelief, take on some giant assumptions, and add some sanity by a combined form of physics (mostly), chemistry, and biology—what you get out of this book are weird but detailed answers that make you raise your eyebrows, laugh, or both. It's fast and fun, easy to devour in one sitting but just as easy to put down and come back to at no great loss. What more could you want?"

This particular book, however, was not a bad read. People have really outdone themselves sending in really weird questions. And the author, on his part, has sometimes gone out of the way to give decent and comprehensible answers. It helps that the book has short chapters and you can pick it up anytime and read any one of them. It might give you some weird insights to impress your friends at the next party. Was it funny? I'd say yes. But more than once I felt that the footnotes were the funniest (however, I'm not sure everyone would get the humor). How much do I remember? Sorry, but not much. I guess, it just means that I can pick it up again in a little while and re-read some bits. Illustrations were great, though. And I liked that it didn't focus just on physics."

So above is the disclaimer at the start of this book which sums up its contents in the most perfect way possible.This book is educating, hilarious, erudite, filled with science, stick figure cartoons, ideas that can bring about the end of your neighbourhood and also brimming with straight scientific facts.

Dressed in spandex tights with glaringly bright red underwear worn atop my trousers and a billowing red cape, I shall fly faster than a speeding bullet into the stratospehere. But from a biological POV since I am not an alien the atmosphere would kill me pretty quickly. I have always wondered if the cold would kill me first or the lack of air would. Munroe surprised me by answering this question among a multitude of others in the book. I would become a popsicle way before the lack of air would have turned me blue. (Note to self : It is always better to imagine yourself as Iron Man for you can have a controlled environment inside the suit. Go Tony !)The author runs a very popular website named xkcd where he answers questions from the curious audience with the aid of science and mathematics. The book is a collection of some of the most popular questions posted on the website along with their scientific answers. Some of the questions might appear to be too absurd but here is what the author thinks of them :They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about hard and soft things, for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying thoroughly to answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.If text books were written in such a fashion, I wouldn’t have had selective amnesia about my physics class. Ah well, it’s never too late to discover books that can show you the right path. If you are a geek god like Patrick Rothfuss who tore through the entire book in two nights then the book wouldn’t overwhelm you. However, if you prefer spending some time mulling over the ideas and setting them down firmly in your mind then it would be better to break this down into chapters and read over a few days. It makes for even more fun and a sound understanding of the concepts.Oh and when you are at it, try and build a wall of the periodic table of elements with the cubes being built of the elements themselves.

I was in a non-fiction reading slump before picking this up, because the non-fiction books I've attempted to read previously have been so dry and boring with massively long chapters that seem to get way off-point.As a scientist, I love learning about everything; the science of life, of how skyscrapers don't fall down, of why siblings fight all the time. But because I'm at university, science books often feel like work rather than a break from work. What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions came nowhere near giving me this feeling. This book is witty and well-written. It made me laugh multiple times over. It's also extremely educational, as it applies real-world science to very weird scenarios, as the title suggests. The science behind the explanations is very simply explained. Sure, the questions people have asked are probably never going to happen, and some of them are scientifically impossible, but the science behind it is the same. The cartoons are funny and offer some serious comic relief to what is already a hilarious book.One line that sticks with me as a chemistry major is this: ""There is no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word 'NO' scrawled over and over in charred blood."" I just laughed too much at this, because material safety data sheets are the bane of my existence sometimes, and it was just so relatable. I showed it to my chemistry friends, and they also loved it. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science, even in the smallest way."
581,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"The title of the book says it all - the science is well researched and there are serious answers to a variety of hypothetical (and largely irrelevant considering their feasibility). At times the science gets to be a little too detailed for casual reading. There is a touch of humour which runs through most of the questions which make for great reading. For instance, to a question on what would be the consequences to Earth in case the sun dies - Randall launches into a detailed explanation of all the positives, and finally ends by saying that we would all be dead though and not in a position to reap any of the mentioned benefits.There are a number of interesting questions such as - when would facebook have more dead people than living, what happens if you are caught up in lightning, what would happen is extremely powerful earthquakes and also very feeble ones, can we get rid of the common cold if we all stayed away from each other for 2 weeks, is it feasible to move all of mankind off Earth....etc.....A few of the questions selected for detailed explanations could have been better though.

He goes into much detail and different scenarios after he painstakingly answers these hypothetical questions. For example: How long would it take you to find another person on the earth if you were the only two on the planet? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humans live? You get the idea. I definitely recommend this for all the science geeks out there.

The author tries to explain some things in advance, but not everything (he may need double the amount of paper and ink, but well, that would be the right way to do it, wouldn't it?)In general, I enjoyed reading the book, as it made me search things out. I am sure not everything will stick in my mind, but something will. The way of writing and sketches are really funny which lightened the mood. I loved most: What would happen if you build the actual periodic table?What if you have a mole (Avogadro Number) of moles?Can we really add more light to the moon by flashing laser pointers at it?What if we drained the oceans and send the water to Mars?What if the sun suddenly goes out?The hairdryer in the box.Self-Fertilizing (even though it was a little bit difficult to understand).and So many others.Very Recommended. It could be your gateway to Science. Science cannot be fun is a Myth. "

The questions raised are downright silly, and you can just picture a dorm room party where they are conceived. Even so, the author demonstrates some solid problem solving skills to give an approximation or simulation of a likely scenario. There is nothing like hypothetical problem solving to under stand the difference between really big numbers and really big compounded numbers. Question - if all the humans on earth could gather in one spot, what US state could they all fit in?a) Rhode Islandb) Indianac) Oregond) TexasThe answer is (view spoiler)[a) Rhode Island (hide spoiler)]. While that may seem surprising at first, it's a pretty simple problem to figure.

Ignorance is not bliss, but advertisers and politicians are hoping you remain in the dark. Along those lines, the author indirectly teaches healthy skepticism of facts and figures found on the internet.[citation needed]"
592,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"What If? is a fun outing in which the author of xkcd answers weird science questions while ignoring the implausibility of those situations ever arising. So we get things like “what if all the rain from a cloud fell in one big droplet” and “what if Earth started expanding” — and Munroe answers them, rummaging through scientific papers and obscure experimental results to find out his closest guess at what would happen. I can’t really speak for his science in most places (only the DNA question was really down my street), but given how pedantic the internet can be, I’m sure Munroe did his absolute best to find an answer that would be, if not incontestable, at least not easily dismissed.The whole thing is illustrated with Munroe’s usual stick figures, and I still remain completely baffled as to how the combination of his stick figures and his lettering can imbue things with feeling. It makes no sense. And yet the Moon promising to help the Earth start spinning again? Gah. Moon, I love you!He also has a humorous tone and a clear way of explaining, so despite the weird situations that he examines, it pretty much all makes sense… though I took his equations for granted, and any other calculations.Originally reviewed on my blog."

He tackles silly questions and gives genuine scientifically valid answers. On occasion he allows magic to first initiate something like a baseball being launched at 0.9 times the speed of light from a pitcher's hands, but promptly returns to actual physical rules of the universe.I learned quite a lot (and I have quite an ample scientific background) and genuinely laughed out loud on several occasions. His style of humour just fits perfectly, and he delivers a punchline in a way you'd never expect from a scientific explanation.Just excellent.

I may never use (or even remember, for that matter) any of the facts mentioned in the book, but I had great fun, laugh-out-loud fun, and I was sorry to see the book end so soon. In the author's words,“They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about [whether there are more hard or soft things in the world], for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.”I did go many interesting places with him, and while I'm sorry to have missed the illustrations in the printed edition of the book, I think the narrator was just as awesome as the books deserves."

This started so good until it wasn’t anymore, which is a disappointment. I really liked how it started, with a question of what would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity. Maybe the reason I liked the question/answer was because I like those apocalyptical scenarios and if it had continued like that I would’ve been content, however it didn’t. Somewhere around the 40% mark things got too sciency—yes I know this is a book with scientific answers, I can read it in the title—and since my knowledge of physics is lower than a middle graders (do they even have physics? Either way they probably know more than I) things started to get over my head… and from there things went downhill my mind started wandering while listening to it, I almost fell asleep and I just couldn’t wait to finish it."

What If?
 is best for in-between reads and/or read over a period of time.For example, it's hilarious;
Q. Assuming a relatively uniform resonant frequency in a passenger jet, how many cats, meowing at what resonant frequency of said jet, would be required to ""bring it down""? - BrittanyA. Hello, FAA? Is There a ""Brittany"" on the no-fly list? ...Yes, with cats. That sounds like her. OK, just making sure you were aware.
informative;
Q. What if I took a swim in a typical spent nuclear fuel pool? Would I need to dive to actually experience a fatal amount of radiation? How long could I stay safely at the surface? - Jonathan Bastien-FillatraultA. ...
and also nonsensical;
Q. What would happen if a hairdryer with continuous power were turned on and put in an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? - Dry ParatroopaA. ...indestructible hair dryer...
""INDESTRUCTIBLE"" hairdryer! Really?This is indeed an entertaining read, however, it also gets jarring and plain boring at times with over explanations that loses interest, especially if it's answering some ridiculous questions."
605,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3792234-caitlin,5,"Before I even start this review, let me just say that my relationship with science and math is about akin to the relationship between Superman and kryptonite.Really basic concepts seem interesting to me but if you start quoting laws, formulas or anything specific, my eyes glaze over and my brain switches over to things it actually understands. The fact that I passed my college chemistry class is still a miracle which I do not fully comprehend. All of this is to explain why it took me so much longer than it should have to read this book. And man do I regret that. Were there things that flew over my head? Oh yeah. But the illustrations (the author, Randall Munroe, is the creator of the xkcd web comic for those who didn’t already know) were so damn funny and the explanations so simple and yet so ridiculous that it kept me laughing and enjoying every minute of it. The questions themselves ranged from: Intriguing  “What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?” (Turns out you shouldn’t do that if you like being alive)TOInsanely, Ridiculously Awesome  “Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward-firing machine guns?”Munroe generally answers the question and then takes them to their furthest possible extent which not only fully satisfied my curiosity but constantly made me laugh out loud. Let’s just say that my fellow bus passengers likely thought I was crazy…or a hyena. And the constant pop culture references to LOTR, Firefly, Star Wars and so many others were just amazing. If you like science and math, you’ll enjoy the outrageous things that Munroe fully supports with facts and sources. If you hate science and math, you’ll likely be as entertained as I was with the wonderfully detailed laymen’s explanations and hilarious illustrations. I really can’t recommend it highly enough. Thanks to my awesome coworker for recommending it, it's definitely one I'll be adding to my bookshelf!"
606,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61646022-rob,5,"The most entertaining book I’ve ever listened to… and yes, this is a SCIENCE BOOK! It only takes a former NASA roboticist to make science hilarious and fun! Luckily, we have one doing just that!OOooooooh god! I wish I had stumbled on this MANY years ago… but it was only published in 2014 and I only discovered it in 2017. Let me get straight to the point. If you ever find yourself thinking what would happen if someone threw a baseball at lightspeed, then read this book! Here’s a hint:This What If book is based on questions asked by fans on the author’s website, Randall Munroe, XKCD. As the title explains, people ask these absolutely absurd questions and… Randall ANSWERS THEM… and puts great effort in researching this absurd shit! It’s highly entertaining and I recommend visiting his website as well. If you didn’t get enough from the book, there are more questions and answers on the site PLUS funny comics!I even found this very inspiring! A roboticist leaving NASA… (NASA!!!) to write stick figure comics full time is pretty damn inspiring! I mean… even if this wasn’t very successful I would have found inspiration in this. Who cares about the high-paying demanding jobs that require you to sell your soul for the work that you do… go out there, find your passion and just draw stick figures if that’s what you love doing!So I listened to the Audiobook version. The physical book version has comics and is very entertaining, HOWEVER… (I’m going to repeat myself from my previous posts) Wil Wheaton narrates the audiobook version and does a FANTASTIC job! I swear … I’m becoming a huge fan based solely on his audiobook work! Ensign Wesley who?? enSIGN me up to his work! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)This innovative piece of work gets full 5 stars from me!I recommend to anyone who has any interest in science (physics, astrophysics, biology, geology, etc.) OR anyone who loves to laugh!"

I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.” Curiosity at its best. How many times have you thought or heard about things which sounded extremely absurd? How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live? If there were a robot apocalypse, how long would humanity last? In this incredibly entertaining book, Randall Munroe, a former NASA scientist answers questions exactly like those, guaranteeing you to have some hours of fun while learning more about science and the world. “They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about hard and soft things, for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.” The phrase above sums up precisely this book. Randall Munroe goes in some theoretical experiments beyond limits of physics and sanity, trying to answer the questions and to popularise at least one bit more scientific knowledge.  “I like it when things catch fire and explode, which means I do not have your best interests in mind.” In this reading, you will learn about astrophysics, chemistry, physics and plenty of other subjects. It's a quick and delightful reading whose audiobook is read by Wil Wheaton, which makes it even better. A maybe-not-so-resourceful book, but sure a funny one about a face of science commonly forgotten. The face originated in humanity's dreams and stupidities.  “The lesson: If the optimist says the glass is half full, and the pessimist says the glass is half empty, the physicist ducks.” I had a professor who always said that ""the human imaginations tires exhaust itself before nature does it"". I must confess that this book brought me some doubts about it. Anyway, this is a wonderful reading for anyone curious about life itself.  “Remember: I am a cartoonist. If you follow my advice on safety around nuclear materials, you probably deserve whatever happens to you.” "

Then the library didn't have a kindle friendly version, but finally, finally all the stars lined up just so and I have to say it was very much worth the wait. Thing is I don't have a scientific prone mind. Languages, history...sure, but science is tough. But I can imagine a perfect world where I'd be very much up on my science because it was taught by Randall Munroe. This man is awesome, he did robotics for NASA, he has an earth annihilating size asteroid named after him, he explains science in funny drawings with stick figures, he's smart and hilarious and exactly the right kind of nerd. This was by far the most enjoyable science book I've ever read and easily one of the most enjoyable educational nonfiction ones. Turns out science is fun and, despite the preposterous scenarios, Munroe's genuinely serious (albeit very humorous) answers really do enlighten and help frame a scientific understanding of the world.

He researches statistics and does modeling that even my non-math-inclined mother would understand. As a bonus, he cues his references and adds his classic comic style to it, too, to illustrate what he's talking about.Everybody should read this book.

624,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,5,"I don’t really need to review this, do I?Randall Munroe is the much-beloved writer and illustrator of the much-beloved webcomic 
xkcd
. He puts his physics and robotics background to good use creating humorous situations based on science, mathematics, and nerd culture. He has since branched out with 
What If?
, a weekly blog in which Munroe answers over-the-top questions by following the facts to whatever consequences they might lead.This is the book of the blog.(That’s like the book of the movie, only it’s a blog, not a movie. Savvy?)So if you’re curious about what this book is like, just go read the blog. You can do that for free. Many of the chapters in the book are reprints from the blog—though some posts have been revised, expanded, or mutated through exposure to gamma radiation. Some of the chapters are new, and just as hilarious.That’s the defining characteristic of What If? for me: it’s a wonderful demonstration of how asking—and answering—questions is fun, and that really should be the backbone of any science education effort.Now, much like Republican politicians, I am not a scientist. I don’t even play one on TV. But I am a mathematician (which is kind of like a scientist, only cooler), and I’m an educator. Math and science share a lot of the bum rap when it comes to which subjects kids enjoy in school, and most of it is bad PR on the part of parents, policy-makers, and teachers. And this makes me angry, because science is wonderful and fascinating and awesome, and I want kids to love it just like I want kids to love math. Even if they don’t particularly want to grow up working in a field that requires a working knowledge of particle physics or a penchant for solving partial differential equations, I want them to dip their toes with joy and abandon into the oceans of inquiry and problem-solving—and not feel pressured or shamed by the fallout from standardized tests that label them with numbers and letters and predictors of success.Munroe is one of a cadre of Internet peoples who is leading the charge in a glorious vanguard of new science education. He gets it. He has that golden spark of talent that puts him in the sweet spot of both knowing the science behind these issues as well as being able to write about them in a humorous, entertaining way. What If? is like an armchair version of MythBusters and no less amazing for it.I’m not exaggerating when I’m saying that I enjoyed every single chapter in this book. I laughed out loud frequently. Even the less interesting ones, or the ones I read before on the blog, are nice to revisit. This is a great coffeetable book for geeks: you can dip in and out of it at will.My favourite chapter has to be “Periodic Wall of Elements,” in which Munroe explains the consequences of trying to construct a periodic table wherein each entry is a sample of the element in question. (Spoiler alert: it doesn’t end well, for you, or your lab, or the city around it.) He just has such a dry style of writing:Sometimes this kind of panic over scary chemicals is disproportionate; there are trace amounts of natural arsenic in all our food and water, and we handle those fine. This is not one of those times.And then slightly later, describing the effects of building the sixth row of the periodic table:The radiation levels would be incredibly high. Given that it takes a few hundred milliseconds to blink, you would literally get a lethal dose of radiation in the blink of an eye.You would die from what we might call “extremely acute radiation poisoning”—that is, you would be cooked.The seventh row would be much worse.This tendency for understatement combines with a keen sense of meta-fictional absurdity that Munroe regularly demonstrates in his webcomic. Indeed, as if his delightful prose is not enough on its own, every answer comes complete with several xkcd-style illustrations that have the same cheeky humour of the comic.What If? is awesome. Full stop. If you are not convinced of this and want to be convinced, go read the blog and the comic. Then buy the book. Then enjoy the hours of entertainment and education you will receive. Share it with kids, and make them love science. Even if it kills them.*

*Please science responsibly, especially if kids are involved. Do not blow things up unless you are a trained professional and have taken appropriate safety measures. Don’t try anything in this book at home. At worst it is very dangerous and would likely destroy the planet; at best, it is extremely impractical and would cost a fortune in electricity."

628,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I took physics in high school, and I remember everyone saying “ah, physics is the science that has all the answers to the questions you have.” I was dreadful at it. There was one questions on a test that asked us to calculate “how many McDonald cheeseburgers of energy would it take to melt all of the ice on Lake Zorinsky if the ice was 1 inch thick across its whole surfact.” I was irate (honesty because I don’t like being bad at things) and all I could think was- WHO IS ASKING THIS QUESTION? Who’s questions and answers was everyone talking about when they were extolling physics? Ugh. And that stuck with me, for forever. I knew, logically, that they were right. Physics is the basis for being able to understand everything. Biology only takes you so far, but if you want to understand how the body really works, eventually you will have to get down to the physics of it. I love storms, I love watching the weather, meteorology is nothing without physics. Ya di ya da. I just personally wanted no part in it.But this book. This book made it fun. These are the type of questions that almost seem so easy on the surface but become increasingly fascinating the further in you dive. Sure, not all of them were physics. My favorite “non-science question” was the one where he calculated how long it will take the dead to outnumber the living on Facebook. That was SUCH a fascinating chapter, and so smartly written, discussing how we will eventually create social mores for dealing with death online. In fact, everyone should probably read the book for that chapter alone. But the chapters discussing what would happen if you put a 10 meter hole at the bottom of the ocean and drained the water out, or what if one GIANT raindrop fell instead of the billions, are chapters that are so fun, and fascinating, and well researched, that they should probably be discussed in high schools just to get kids excited about science. They are witty and brilliant, and now, are amazing topics of conversation.I’ve always been a fan of XKCD’s comics but he really outdid himself with this book!"
629,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15102294-marc-gerstein,4,"I have to be honest: I zoned out a lot early on. I’m just not a science geek. Why then, do I give it a good rating? Two reasons: It introduced me to the author’s xkcd web comics, which I do get and rally enjoy. And second, because I recognize what Munroe is doing in these answers-chapters and although the subject matter is not my cup of tea, I’m a big fan of the process he demonstrates. Essentially, and whether or not it’s his specific intention, Munroe is showing, at a micro level, the creative thought process at work and in a way that transcends the boundaries of a specific discipline. In this book, it’s mainly physics. In another setting (such as at a Wall Street firm), a job applicant may be asked for an immediate answer to a question like how many 8-ounce helpings of orange juice are consumed daily in the U.S. The applicant won’t be evaluated on the number given in the answer. What’s important is how the applicant can get there, starting with a very limited number of known facts or plausible assumptions and then using that as a springboard for a chain of possibilities, probabilities, relationships and inferences.That’s what Munroe does. 1. Question. 2. What needs to be considered. 3. Reasonable first impression answer. 4. Tweak the question to push the boundaries. 5. Loop back to step 2 and keep going . . . and going . . . and going. Extreme inference? Not sure what the logicians would describe it. Whatever.I don’t see this as necessarily a book to be read in sequence cover to cover. I see it as one of those coffee-table type things; pick a chapter, read it, consider it, enjoy it, and put the book down. Go back and do it again and again over time, and picking whatever topic catches your fancy at the moment. For me, once I figured out what this book was all about, I focused most on the topics I had a decent chance of understanding and enjoyed it."

This started so good until it wasn’t anymore, which is a disappointment. I really liked how it started, with a question of what would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity. Maybe the reason I liked the question/answer was because I like those apocalyptical scenarios and if it had continued like that I would’ve been content, however it didn’t. Somewhere around the 40% mark things got too sciency—yes I know this is a book with scientific answers, I can read it in the title—and since my knowledge of physics is lower than a middle graders (do they even have physics? Either way they probably know more than I) things started to get over my head… and from there things went downhill my mind started wandering while listening to it, I almost fell asleep and I just couldn’t wait to finish it."

What If?
 is best for in-between reads and/or read over a period of time.For example, it's hilarious;
Q. Assuming a relatively uniform resonant frequency in a passenger jet, how many cats, meowing at what resonant frequency of said jet, would be required to ""bring it down""? - BrittanyA. Hello, FAA? Is There a ""Brittany"" on the no-fly list? ...Yes, with cats. That sounds like her. OK, just making sure you were aware.
informative;
Q. What if I took a swim in a typical spent nuclear fuel pool? Would I need to dive to actually experience a fatal amount of radiation? How long could I stay safely at the surface? - Jonathan Bastien-FillatraultA. ...
and also nonsensical;
Q. What would happen if a hairdryer with continuous power were turned on and put in an airtight 1 x 1 x 1-meter box? - Dry ParatroopaA. ...indestructible hair dryer...
""INDESTRUCTIBLE"" hairdryer! Really?This is indeed an entertaining read, however, it also gets jarring and plain boring at times with over explanations that loses interest, especially if it's answering some ridiculous questions."
635,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3792234-caitlin,5,"Before I even start this review, let me just say that my relationship with science and math is about akin to the relationship between Superman and kryptonite.Really basic concepts seem interesting to me but if you start quoting laws, formulas or anything specific, my eyes glaze over and my brain switches over to things it actually understands. The fact that I passed my college chemistry class is still a miracle which I do not fully comprehend. All of this is to explain why it took me so much longer than it should have to read this book. And man do I regret that. Were there things that flew over my head? Oh yeah. But the illustrations (the author, Randall Munroe, is the creator of the xkcd web comic for those who didn’t already know) were so damn funny and the explanations so simple and yet so ridiculous that it kept me laughing and enjoying every minute of it. The questions themselves ranged from: Intriguing  “What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?” (Turns out you shouldn’t do that if you like being alive)TOInsanely, Ridiculously Awesome  “Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward-firing machine guns?”Munroe generally answers the question and then takes them to their furthest possible extent which not only fully satisfied my curiosity but constantly made me laugh out loud. Let’s just say that my fellow bus passengers likely thought I was crazy…or a hyena. And the constant pop culture references to LOTR, Firefly, Star Wars and so many others were just amazing. If you like science and math, you’ll enjoy the outrageous things that Munroe fully supports with facts and sources. If you hate science and math, you’ll likely be as entertained as I was with the wonderfully detailed laymen’s explanations and hilarious illustrations. I really can’t recommend it highly enough. Thanks to my awesome coworker for recommending it, it's definitely one I'll be adding to my bookshelf!"
636,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61646022-rob,5,"The most entertaining book I’ve ever listened to… and yes, this is a SCIENCE BOOK! It only takes a former NASA roboticist to make science hilarious and fun! Luckily, we have one doing just that!OOooooooh god! I wish I had stumbled on this MANY years ago… but it was only published in 2014 and I only discovered it in 2017. Let me get straight to the point. If you ever find yourself thinking what would happen if someone threw a baseball at lightspeed, then read this book! Here’s a hint:This What If book is based on questions asked by fans on the author’s website, Randall Munroe, XKCD. As the title explains, people ask these absolutely absurd questions and… Randall ANSWERS THEM… and puts great effort in researching this absurd shit! It’s highly entertaining and I recommend visiting his website as well. If you didn’t get enough from the book, there are more questions and answers on the site PLUS funny comics!I even found this very inspiring! A roboticist leaving NASA… (NASA!!!) to write stick figure comics full time is pretty damn inspiring! I mean… even if this wasn’t very successful I would have found inspiration in this. Who cares about the high-paying demanding jobs that require you to sell your soul for the work that you do… go out there, find your passion and just draw stick figures if that’s what you love doing!So I listened to the Audiobook version. The physical book version has comics and is very entertaining, HOWEVER… (I’m going to repeat myself from my previous posts) Wil Wheaton narrates the audiobook version and does a FANTASTIC job! I swear … I’m becoming a huge fan based solely on his audiobook work! Ensign Wesley who?? enSIGN me up to his work! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)This innovative piece of work gets full 5 stars from me!I recommend to anyone who has any interest in science (physics, astrophysics, biology, geology, etc.) OR anyone who loves to laugh!"

I see it as a lesson about the limitations of wax as an adhesive.” Curiosity at its best. How many times have you thought or heard about things which sounded extremely absurd? How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live? If there were a robot apocalypse, how long would humanity last? In this incredibly entertaining book, Randall Munroe, a former NASA scientist answers questions exactly like those, guaranteeing you to have some hours of fun while learning more about science and the world. “They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about hard and soft things, for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying to thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.” The phrase above sums up precisely this book. Randall Munroe goes in some theoretical experiments beyond limits of physics and sanity, trying to answer the questions and to popularise at least one bit more scientific knowledge.  “I like it when things catch fire and explode, which means I do not have your best interests in mind.” In this reading, you will learn about astrophysics, chemistry, physics and plenty of other subjects. It's a quick and delightful reading whose audiobook is read by Wil Wheaton, which makes it even better. A maybe-not-so-resourceful book, but sure a funny one about a face of science commonly forgotten. The face originated in humanity's dreams and stupidities.  “The lesson: If the optimist says the glass is half full, and the pessimist says the glass is half empty, the physicist ducks.” I had a professor who always said that ""the human imaginations tires exhaust itself before nature does it"". I must confess that this book brought me some doubts about it. Anyway, this is a wonderful reading for anyone curious about life itself.  “Remember: I am a cartoonist. If you follow my advice on safety around nuclear materials, you probably deserve whatever happens to you.” "

Then the library didn't have a kindle friendly version, but finally, finally all the stars lined up just so and I have to say it was very much worth the wait. Thing is I don't have a scientific prone mind. Languages, history...sure, but science is tough. But I can imagine a perfect world where I'd be very much up on my science because it was taught by Randall Munroe. This man is awesome, he did robotics for NASA, he has an earth annihilating size asteroid named after him, he explains science in funny drawings with stick figures, he's smart and hilarious and exactly the right kind of nerd. This was by far the most enjoyable science book I've ever read and easily one of the most enjoyable educational nonfiction ones. Turns out science is fun and, despite the preposterous scenarios, Munroe's genuinely serious (albeit very humorous) answers really do enlighten and help frame a scientific understanding of the world.

He researches statistics and does modeling that even my non-math-inclined mother would understand. As a bonus, he cues his references and adds his classic comic style to it, too, to illustrate what he's talking about.Everybody should read this book.

654,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,5,"I don’t really need to review this, do I?Randall Munroe is the much-beloved writer and illustrator of the much-beloved webcomic 
xkcd
. He puts his physics and robotics background to good use creating humorous situations based on science, mathematics, and nerd culture. He has since branched out with 
What If?
, a weekly blog in which Munroe answers over-the-top questions by following the facts to whatever consequences they might lead.This is the book of the blog.(That’s like the book of the movie, only it’s a blog, not a movie. Savvy?)So if you’re curious about what this book is like, just go read the blog. You can do that for free. Many of the chapters in the book are reprints from the blog—though some posts have been revised, expanded, or mutated through exposure to gamma radiation. Some of the chapters are new, and just as hilarious.That’s the defining characteristic of What If? for me: it’s a wonderful demonstration of how asking—and answering—questions is fun, and that really should be the backbone of any science education effort.Now, much like Republican politicians, I am not a scientist. I don’t even play one on TV. But I am a mathematician (which is kind of like a scientist, only cooler), and I’m an educator. Math and science share a lot of the bum rap when it comes to which subjects kids enjoy in school, and most of it is bad PR on the part of parents, policy-makers, and teachers. And this makes me angry, because science is wonderful and fascinating and awesome, and I want kids to love it just like I want kids to love math. Even if they don’t particularly want to grow up working in a field that requires a working knowledge of particle physics or a penchant for solving partial differential equations, I want them to dip their toes with joy and abandon into the oceans of inquiry and problem-solving—and not feel pressured or shamed by the fallout from standardized tests that label them with numbers and letters and predictors of success.Munroe is one of a cadre of Internet peoples who is leading the charge in a glorious vanguard of new science education. He gets it. He has that golden spark of talent that puts him in the sweet spot of both knowing the science behind these issues as well as being able to write about them in a humorous, entertaining way. What If? is like an armchair version of MythBusters and no less amazing for it.I’m not exaggerating when I’m saying that I enjoyed every single chapter in this book. I laughed out loud frequently. Even the less interesting ones, or the ones I read before on the blog, are nice to revisit. This is a great coffeetable book for geeks: you can dip in and out of it at will.My favourite chapter has to be “Periodic Wall of Elements,” in which Munroe explains the consequences of trying to construct a periodic table wherein each entry is a sample of the element in question. (Spoiler alert: it doesn’t end well, for you, or your lab, or the city around it.) He just has such a dry style of writing:Sometimes this kind of panic over scary chemicals is disproportionate; there are trace amounts of natural arsenic in all our food and water, and we handle those fine. This is not one of those times.And then slightly later, describing the effects of building the sixth row of the periodic table:The radiation levels would be incredibly high. Given that it takes a few hundred milliseconds to blink, you would literally get a lethal dose of radiation in the blink of an eye.You would die from what we might call “extremely acute radiation poisoning”—that is, you would be cooked.The seventh row would be much worse.This tendency for understatement combines with a keen sense of meta-fictional absurdity that Munroe regularly demonstrates in his webcomic. Indeed, as if his delightful prose is not enough on its own, every answer comes complete with several xkcd-style illustrations that have the same cheeky humour of the comic.What If? is awesome. Full stop. If you are not convinced of this and want to be convinced, go read the blog and the comic. Then buy the book. Then enjoy the hours of entertainment and education you will receive. Share it with kids, and make them love science. Even if it kills them.*

*Please science responsibly, especially if kids are involved. Do not blow things up unless you are a trained professional and have taken appropriate safety measures. Don’t try anything in this book at home. At worst it is very dangerous and would likely destroy the planet; at best, it is extremely impractical and would cost a fortune in electricity."

There was one questions on a test that asked us to calculate “how many McDonald cheeseburgers of energy would it take to melt all of the ice on Lake Zorinsky if the ice was 1 inch thick across its whole surfact.” I was irate (honesty because I don’t like being bad at things) and all I could think was- WHO IS ASKING THIS QUESTION? Who’s questions and answers was everyone talking about when they were extolling physics? Ugh. And that stuck with me, for forever. I knew, logically, that they were right. Physics is the basis for being able to understand everything. Biology only takes you so far, but if you want to understand how the body really works, eventually you will have to get down to the physics of it. I love storms, I love watching the weather, meteorology is nothing without physics. Ya di ya da. I just personally wanted no part in it.But this book. This book made it fun. These are the type of questions that almost seem so easy on the surface but become increasingly fascinating the further in you dive. Sure, not all of them were physics. My favorite “non-science question” was the one where he calculated how long it will take the dead to outnumber the living on Facebook. That was SUCH a fascinating chapter, and so smartly written, discussing how we will eventually create social mores for dealing with death online. In fact, everyone should probably read the book for that chapter alone. But the chapters discussing what would happen if you put a 10 meter hole at the bottom of the ocean and drained the water out, or what if one GIANT raindrop fell instead of the billions, are chapters that are so fun, and fascinating, and well researched, that they should probably be discussed in high schools just to get kids excited about science.

Essentially, and whether or not it’s his specific intention, Munroe is showing, at a micro level, the creative thought process at work and in a way that transcends the boundaries of a specific discipline. In this book, it’s mainly physics.

What’s important is how the applicant can get there, starting with a very limited number of known facts or plausible assumptions and then using that as a springboard for a chain of possibilities, probabilities, relationships and inferences.That’s what Munroe does. 1. Question. 2. What needs to be considered. 3. Reasonable first impression answer. 4. Tweak the question to push the boundaries. 5. Loop back to step 2 and keep going . . . and going . . . and going. Extreme inference? Not sure what the logicians would describe it. Whatever.I don’t see this as necessarily a book to be read in sequence cover to cover. I see it as one of those coffee-table type things; pick a chapter, read it, consider it, enjoy it, and put the book down. Go back and do it again and again over time, and picking whatever topic catches your fancy at the moment. For me, once I figured out what this book was all about, I focused most on the topics I had a decent chance of understanding and enjoyed it."

But when the sub-title to this book has the phrase ""Serious Scientific Answers"" and then 90% of the answers precis with ""let's first ignore the physics of Earth to answer this questions about something relating to the physics of light,"" I wonder how ""serious"" it really is. And it also gets a little tiresome because while the humor is pretty good, the tone and tenor is exceptionally single-note. There's some hearty guffaws and hoots and knee-slaps to be had, but at the end the questions are thin ""OMG SO RANDOM!!!!,"" and you can tell many of the submissions were people reaching a tad too hard for the absurd, wanting to be included in the book--ie. they're absurd for no real value than giggles.Times reminded me of that television show Mythbusters where the basic scientific principal behind the ""myth,"" or, in this case, the ""absurd question,"" is presented in a fairly straightforward way in approximately 2 sentences. Then, the proceeding 3-5 pages was jocular ""serious science"" that ""ignored"" the realities of physical possibility for the sake of comedy. Maybe I'm being to hard on it for being a comical book. But as a book of comedy, then shouldn't it offer more than just ""goofy"" as it's comic device? There's some great slapstick. Funny moments of the absurd. But halfway through, I was met with disinterest, slogging through. I was even reading this thing at a leisurely pace over the course of the past month or so.I've enjoyed Munroe's webcomic presence since I first discovered it sometime around 2010, but somehow seeing it laid bare, page after page exposed its thin fragility. How simplistic it really is, hiding behind a veil of scientific jargon and goofy-absurd premises. The book gave pleasure and entertainment, but not a sustained sensation of either. Perhaps best served as a ""coffee table book"" left to be dipped into randomly rather than read cover to cover, even if over the course of several weeks."
661,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,5,"Let me cut right to the chase and say that this is the kind of book that could change the trajectory of someone's life if you got it in the right hands at the right time.I sent copies to my nieces and nephews and to the families in my daughter's playgroup that we're still in regular touch with. I'm debating giving copies out for Halloween this year. I'll buy a copy for your kid if he or she (especially she) wants one.If you are already familiar with http://what-if.xkcd.com/ then you know what this book is like: Sort of a Straight Dope meets Richard Feynman deal in which outlandish questions are answered with heaps of playful speculation, physics, math, and whatnot.I bought this book for Matt, but I read it in one sitting. It reminded me of everything I liked about my math and science classes growing up, especially the playfulness and creativity of learning things and then applying them to different problems.The questions are very silly, by the way, almost to the point of being inconsequential. (Examples: What if everyone pointed a laser pointer at the moon? What if the Earth stopped rotating? What if you had a mole [the number] of moles [the animal]?) But that's part of what makes the answers so great. There are some questions that even Mr. Munroe refuses to answer, which are also lovingly captured.When I tossed the book to Matt, he saw the cartoon of a T. Rex being lowered into a Sarlacc via a crane and said cool. The next day he was excited to talk with me about baseballs going at relativistic speeds.Highly recommended. Matt just told me that he would give it 5 stars, too. Reviews coming in from around the country have been uniformly positive, too."
662,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7233842-jaksen,5,"A great book, however you must THINK to appreciate it. It also helps to have somewhat of a scientific background, or interest.(Former science teacher here of 35 years.)As I read this book - and some parts I skimmed over - I remembered students doing this to me. In a perfectly ordinary classroom discussion, after a perfectly ordinary lab experiment - like separating HCl (using zinc mossy) into H and zinc chloride, for example, and blowing up the H gas in long test tubes to shrieks of delight and omg can we do this AGAIN! (And we did, until I ran out of supplies. I was always buying stuff for school, it seems,) someone, usually a boy (sexist me) would say, Can we...what would happen if we...Substituted nitric acid. Used tin or aluminum. Did this outside in a giant balloon. Filled up my stepdad's car with H gas and lit it. And on and on ...I called these stupid questions and everyone would laugh, then I'd try to answer as best I could, but often I'd say, well, I don't have enough information to know what would - if we did - and it would be VERY dangerous - and DON'T do this at home.(I did have one student who duplicated many of our classroom experiments at home. He's now a nuclear physicist, so go figure.)Enough about me! This book was GREAT! I loved it. I read most of it - the chemistry and few biology sections were the most familiar to me. And the occasional volcano question. Physics I can follow unless it gets toooo deeeep, but Mr. Munroe has a way of explaining things that is never 'talking down' or dumbing down the info. The questions might be silly, stupid, or often ludicrous, but the answers? Pure genius."
663,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey,3,"Listened to this one on audiobook, which is narrated by Wil Wheaton. He was a great narrator and perfect for this book. The book is exactly what it says it is and the author goes and answers each questions but even goes beyond that. It can get super detailed and specific and he continues to add onto the scenarios. It got a bit too science-y for ME because I don't know that much about physics and chemistry so some of the deeper dives lost me a bit. But overall a fun listen. "

Well, he actually quit his job to start drawing cartoons at xkcd.com, so I don't know where his workspace is now... Frankly, covid-19 has me holed up in my basement most of the time now (it's where most of the books are, after all). Example of a comic found on his website: This book is informative, gleeful, and irreverent as Munroe goes about exploring questions as crazy as ""From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?"" or as strangly specific as ""How quickly would the oceans drain if a circular portal 10 meters in radius leading into space were created at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest spot in the ocean?"" Such questions have been gathered from Munroe's website, and the derivation of his thoroughly researched answers follows. You need to suspend your disbelief, take on some giant assumptions, and add some sanity by a combined form of physics (mostly), chemistry, and biology—what you get out of this book are weird but detailed answers that make you raise your eyebrows, laugh, or both. It's fast and fun, easy to devour in one sitting but just as easy to put down and come back to at no great loss. What more could you want?"
668,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11281532-lita,4,"I don't usually read popular science books, but I'm a fan of scientific or academic comics (including the ones done by the author) - it just helps to put a bit of fun into the academic world. This particular book, however, was not a bad read. People have really outdone themselves sending in really weird questions. And the author, on his part, has sometimes gone out of the way to give decent and comprehensible answers. It helps that the book has short chapters and you can pick it up anytime and read any one of them. It might give you some weird insights to impress your friends at the next party. Was it funny? I'd say yes. But more than once I felt that the footnotes were the funniest (however, I'm not sure everyone would get the humor). How much do I remember? Sorry, but not much. I guess, it just means that I can pick it up again in a little while and re-read some bits. Illustrations were great, though. And I liked that it didn't focus just on physics."

So above is the disclaimer at the start of this book which sums up its contents in the most perfect way possible.This book is educating, hilarious, erudite, filled with science, stick figure cartoons, ideas that can bring about the end of your neighbourhood and also brimming with straight scientific facts. Personally, I have always wondered how it would be to become Superman and soar above planet Earth in a regal fashion. Dressed in spandex tights with glaringly bright red underwear worn atop my trousers and a billowing red cape, I shall fly faster than a speeding bullet into the stratospehere. But from a biological POV since I am not an alien the atmosphere would kill me pretty quickly. I have always wondered if the cold would kill me first or the lack of air would. Munroe surprised me by answering this question among a multitude of others in the book. I would become a popsicle way before the lack of air would have turned me blue. (Note to self : It is always better to imagine yourself as Iron Man for you can have a controlled environment inside the suit. Go Tony !)The author runs a very popular website named xkcd where he answers questions from the curious audience with the aid of science and mathematics. The book is a collection of some of the most popular questions posted on the website along with their scientific answers. Some of the questions might appear to be too absurd but here is what the author thinks of them :They say there are no stupid questions. That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about hard and soft things, for example, is pretty stupid. But it turns out that trying thoroughly to answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places.If text books were written in such a fashion, I wouldn’t have had selective amnesia about my physics class. Ah well, it’s never too late to discover books that can show you the right path. If you are a geek god like Patrick Rothfuss who tore through the entire book in two nights then the book wouldn’t overwhelm you. However, if you prefer spending some time mulling over the ideas and setting them down firmly in your mind then it would be better to break this down into chapters and read over a few days. It makes for even more fun and a sound understanding of the concepts.Oh and when you are at it, try and build a wall of the periodic table of elements with the cubes being built of the elements themselves.

I was in a non-fiction reading slump before picking this up, because the non-fiction books I've attempted to read previously have been so dry and boring with massively long chapters that seem to get way off-point.As a scientist, I love learning about everything; the science of life, of how skyscrapers don't fall down, of why siblings fight all the time. But because I'm at university, science books often feel like work rather than a break from work. What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions came nowhere near giving me this feeling. This book is witty and well-written. It made me laugh multiple times over. It's also extremely educational, as it applies real-world science to very weird scenarios, as the title suggests. The science behind the explanations is very simply explained. Sure, the questions people have asked are probably never going to happen, and some of them are scientifically impossible, but the science behind it is the same. The cartoons are funny and offer some serious comic relief to what is already a hilarious book.One line that sticks with me as a chemistry major is this: ""There is no material safety data sheet for astatine. If there were, it would just be the word 'NO' scrawled over and over in charred blood."" I just laughed too much at this, because material safety data sheets are the bane of my existence sometimes, and it was just so relatable. I showed it to my chemistry friends, and they also loved it. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science, even in the smallest way."
671,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"The title of the book says it all - the science is well researched and there are serious answers to a variety of hypothetical (and largely irrelevant considering their feasibility). At times the science gets to be a little too detailed for casual reading. There is a touch of humour which runs through most of the questions which make for great reading. For instance, to a question on what would be the consequences to Earth in case the sun dies - Randall launches into a detailed explanation of all the positives, and finally ends by saying that we would all be dead though and not in a position to reap any of the mentioned benefits.There are a number of interesting questions such as - when would facebook have more dead people than living, what happens if you are caught up in lightning, what would happen is extremely powerful earthquakes and also very feeble ones, can we get rid of the common cold if we all stayed away from each other for 2 weeks, is it feasible to move all of mankind off Earth....etc.....A few of the questions selected for detailed explanations could have been better though. Overall, a great book, it is fun reading if you like science!"

He goes into much detail and different scenarios after he painstakingly answers these hypothetical questions. For example: How long would it take you to find another person on the earth if you were the only two on the planet? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humans live? You get the idea. I definitely recommend this for all the science geeks out there. It was fun to listen to while driving and a nice break from the norm. 4 stars. "

Whatever the reason, this book was able to make me laugh and keep my eyes wide with wonder through almost every page. The questions are delightful, if absurd. For example: If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color? Or, Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward-firing machine guns? One of my favorites: What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?The answers take each question seriously and bring in the relevant science.

For those that aren't the majority of these What if? questions aren't so much answered as turned up to 11 and then answered.For those looking for structure and a coherent theme, I would not recommend this book, but for those with a mad sense of humour, this might just be what you're looking for (citation needed) "

What if? will give you some great laughs accompanied by unusual pieces of information. The book contains a lot of weird questions (makes me want to submit questions of my own too), in which you will definitely not show the same amount of interest, but some things in there will surely intrigue you.There are two drawbacks which made me drop the last star:1.0 The questions are way too randomly organized (mostly). Because the book has so many questions about so many topics, reading about different ideas may not be very comfortable to all readers (this is science we are talking about, even if it has been lightened). I would have suggested (as I do with these kinds of books) to collect the similar questions (or these of the same science field) to be in sequence (It will not fully work but still I think it will make it better). ex. questions about space, or about earth atmosphere, or about statistics. 2.0 The book doesn't take into consideration that not all readers have scientific background. The author tries to explain some things in advance, but not everything (he may need double the amount of paper and ink, but well, that would be the right way to do it, wouldn't it?)In general, I enjoyed reading the book, as it made me search things out. I am sure not everything will stick in my mind, but something will. The way of writing and sketches are really funny which lightened the mood. I loved most: What would happen if you build the actual periodic table?What if you have a mole (Avogadro Number) of moles?Can we really add more light to the moon by flashing laser pointers at it?What if we drained the oceans and send the water to Mars?What if the sun suddenly goes out?The hairdryer in the box.Self-Fertilizing (even though it was a little bit difficult to understand).and So many others.Very Recommended.

682,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"What If? is a fun outing in which the author of xkcd answers weird science questions while ignoring the implausibility of those situations ever arising. So we get things like “what if all the rain from a cloud fell in one big droplet” and “what if Earth started expanding” — and Munroe answers them, rummaging through scientific papers and obscure experimental results to find out his closest guess at what would happen. I can’t really speak for his science in most places (only the DNA question was really down my street), but given how pedantic the internet can be, I’m sure Munroe did his absolute best to find an answer that would be, if not incontestable, at least not easily dismissed.The whole thing is illustrated with Munroe’s usual stick figures, and I still remain completely baffled as to how the combination of his stick figures and his lettering can imbue things with feeling. It makes no sense. And yet the Moon promising to help the Earth start spinning again? Gah. Moon, I love you!He also has a humorous tone and a clear way of explaining, so despite the weird situations that he examines, it pretty much all makes sense… though I took his equations for granted, and any other calculations.Originally reviewed on my blog."

He tackles silly questions and gives genuine scientifically valid answers. On occasion he allows magic to first initiate something like a baseball being launched at 0.9 times the speed of light from a pitcher's hands, but promptly returns to actual physical rules of the universe.I learned quite a lot (and I have quite an ample scientific background) and genuinely laughed out loud on several occasions. His style of humour just fits perfectly, and he delivers a punchline in a way you'd never expect from a scientific explanation.Just excellent.

That’s obviously wrong; I think my question about [whether there are more hard or soft things in the world], for example, is pretty stupid.

Munroe has recently announced that he will follow this success with a sequel, How To; and this leads us naturally to consider whether this will turn into a trilogy. If so, we can already begin to predict how the last installment will be named.If we assume that the title will, like its predecessors, consist of two words, the range of possibilities is quite large. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that the total number of unique two-word combinations in English is over 29 billion. If we then make the assumption that one of these words has to be a question word (who, what, where…) then the list is still massive—well over one million. We can further restrict possibilities: first, to short words (one or two syllables); and, second, to idiomatic English expressions. Unfortunately, the list is still quite long.

Most (if not all) of the questions are simply useless. I mean why would I even give a fuck ""what would happen if you were to gather a mole of moles in one place"", or ""how many unique English tweets are possible and how long it would take for the population of the world to read them out loud"" (what the fuck???), or ""if you call a random phone number and say god bless you, what are the chances that the person who answers just sneezed"", or ""what would happen if you tried to fly a normal Earth airplane in space""? This definitely isn't what I call educating. It's not even fun as a matter of fact. What's more, the answers given are absurdly complicated. Munroe in order to fill the pages, adds more useless factors making it even more boring and thus forcing you to think ""why on earth am I reading this?"". Honestly I haven't seen so much useless information gathered together ever before. The extra star goes for the author's occasionally witty sense of humor."

This book will be better appreciated if one has some kind of scientific background and a somewhat superficial understanding of Physics (at least a basic knowledge). A cursory reading of the book is not enough. If one does fulfill this two prerequisites, one must be prepared to have to look up quite a few things elsewhere.

Some of the science was way more complex than expected and I got a little lost. There were some really interesting ""What ifs?"", though, and the book gave me lots of new random trivia to share.Also, unless I was just reading a weird version that omitted it, I was disappointed that the T-Rex being lowered into the Sarlac Pit (from the cover) was not in the book."
698,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"Somehow I’ve expected it to be better. I liked many things but I'm still a bit disappointed. The main problem is probably that most of the questions (or more like the answers to them) concerned astrophysics and generally advanced physics. These are definitely areas of knowledge that interest me least. Problems in probability or biology were much more interesting to me.Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about astrophysics and they all seemed quite similar to me. Therefore, the whole book seems a bit monotonous to me. It could use a greater variety of questions - from biology, chemistry, advanced mathematics, maybe even history (questions like what would happen if it happened otherwise). Maybe some questions closer to the humanities or social sciences. But the author sticks to everything that can be measured and counted quite precisely.I'm also a bit disappointed with the questions themselves. I expected them to be really crazy. Just look at the cover - a dinosaur thrown into what looks like a black hole in the desert from which some tentacles stick out. It promises to be great! And the subtitle ""Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions"". Well, these questions are not that weird or absurd. At least for a layman. Or maybe I just don't think about shooting a neutron bomb to Earth on a daily basis. I expected exactly what in the title, bizarre questions that will be of interest to me and to which I will get a professional answer. And that's why I'm a little disappointed.After some time, all the questions and answers merged into one and became a little boring. I even started skipping paragraphs in after the next astrophysics question.Also, I have the impression that the questions in the joke sections did not differ much from those to which the author was looking for answers. Maybe except that they were more interesting, sometimes macabre but usually more interesting. It is a pity that the author did not try to answer even briefly on them.This is not a bad book but more intended for people who are interested in physics. It also seems to me that sometimes I simply lacked a lot of knowledge to fully understand the answer to a question. I have already read similar books and some of them were more interesting. I'm afraid I didn't get as much knowledge from this as I did from them. The questions were too uninteresting and the answers too complicated."

The magic faded drastically after very interesting answers in the beginning.Favorites were :*What would happen if you hit a baseball pitched at 90% speed of light?*Would the Moon change colour if every person aimed a laser pointer at it simultaneously? [We had a real crazy discussion  for this in a group!]*What would happen if real cube shaped Elements bricks are placed at respective position in a Periodic table?*If every human disappeared, which would be the last artificial light source to go out?Some of the comic strips were really hilarious!"
700,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35465603-natalia-de-lune,5," Randall Munroe is brilliant. I know he would disagree with me on this matter. Randall considers himself a simple cartoonist/former NASA roboticist ( just think how cool his curriculum must be),but I have been following his work for long enough to be convinced that he is anything other than brilliant. And I don’t use this term loosely. I’m not talking about his physics knowledge in particular, but mostly about his ability to pass the knowledge forward. It’s easy to understand, and it’s entertaining. I was enthralled to find out he wrote a book, and as the professional lazy person I’m proud to be, I’m only reviewing this now. Anyway, I finally got my lazy ass to finish reading, and it’s exactly what I was expecting: It’s funny, it’s entertaining, and it’s brilliant. I’ve laughed out loud more times than I cared to count,specially at the “Weird and Worrying questions”. I’ve chosen a few of my favorite ones:•	What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? •	 Would it be possible to get your teeth to such a cold temperature that they would shatter upon drinking a hot cup of coffee?•	What if everyone actually had only one soul mate,a random person somewhere on the world?•	What if you strapped C4 to a boomerang?

702,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,4,"Randall Patrick Munroe is many things; a former NASA roboticist, the mind behind the scientifically corky and totally hilarious xkcd comic, and the author of What if? In What if? Munroe uses drawings (same as in xkcd), math, some engineering-know-how and tons of logical reasoning to answer outlandish but intriguing questions, all proving that science can be fun and that learning how to think critically is a skill we all need (and must develop). I’m a scientist and I like anything and everything that helps others discover how incredibly entertaining thinking critically and using science can be, so I enjoyed this book enormously. Bonus points, you can read a question at a time just before going to bed as a way to give your brain something to chew on that’s not the present state of the world, but you can also read a bunch of the questions all at once for a more immersive experience. What the heck, you can even have this book near the toilet and read a question each time you’re there. I guarantee you, after a week of that, you won’t even care about bringing your phone along to play candy crush or plants vs zombies or whatever else you’ve been doing there with your phone. As I read the book, I discovered that my favorites questions all seemed to have something in common: they reminded me of instances where Hollywood movies use deux-ex-machina-not scientific-at-all solutions for their plot problems. Think Superman (1978) and the infamous scene when the aforementioned superhero flights around the Earth until it stops it and turns its rotation, and somehow time as well, back. Well the very first question in the book deals with that: What would happen of the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity? And it does a fantastic job at showing that Superman would have killed us all gaining absolutely nothing from his misdirected efforts.Munroe’s writing is as witty as it is serious and that works just well in the context of this book and the way it is organize.A solid four star, and a good book to have around to keep your mind entertained and in top shape."
703,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,5,"This book was laugh out loud funny! The questions were completely absurd but some really fascinated me. Also, the answers were totally serious but were also simple enough even a science novice will understand them. (Although, some may balk at all the metrics. But deal with it, the entire world is metric.)I sure hope Munroe follows this book up with ""More What If?""!"

Maybe I just don't get the author's sense of humor, or the questions he chose to answer were just really weird and dumb to me, but I did NOT get this book.

709,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66672731-michael-jandrok,5,"I firmly believe that that the key to making science accessible to the public at large is to make it FUN. Yes, it also needs to be written at a layman’s level in easily understandable language. But to REACH a large proportion of people, it needs to be interesting and engaging. Humor helps with that a lot. Randall Munroe, a former NASA roboticist and creator of the web comic “xkcd,” has a pretty good handle on how to merge all of these elements into a wildly entertaining trip through some basic science principles through the lens of crazy questions posed by his readers on the web page. As the full title of the book states, it’s “serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.” Now I will state that I LOVE this premise. It reminds me of some of the brainstorming techniques that I used to use as a practicing project manager. In a meeting designed to generate ideas, it’s a fun tactic to get the group to spit out the most outlandish scenarios first. By doing so, a good manager can bring a wealth of imagination to the table, and sometimes a group can strike gold with a course of action that might have seemed specious at first.  So in this book, you get questions like these: From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground? What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground in the same instant? And perhaps my favorite question: What would happen if you were to gather a mole (the unit of measurement) of moles (the small, furry critter) in one place? So author Munroe sets about to answering these absurd hypothetical questions, always with gentle humor and always illustrated with his signature stick figure drawings. He patiently wades through some TRULY wild questions with solid science and explanations that anyone with at least a basic understanding of science and math can easily understand. It’s a quick read and tons of fun. 51% of the material is brand new to this book, which means that…..anyone? Anyone? Bueller? …….49% of the material has already appeared on the “xkcd” web page. That probably makes it a worthwhile read even if you are a regular on the website. There are also a TON of interesting footnotes full of in-jokes and sly mirth.  Scientific literacy is in trouble in the USA. There is an urgent need for more rigorous training in basic science and math at EVERY level of the educational system. As such, I will give 5 stars for a book like this that aims to bring science to the masses in an engaging way. In my opinion, science NEEDS to be popularized and celebrated as much as possible. Randall Munroe is doing good work with his web page and this book. Carry on, good sir."
710,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18813588-brian-proffitt,5,"There are times I miss my physics degree.It's not that it went anywhere, mind you, but I have not really used it professionally and it does not come up in my daily life very often. There are exceptions, such as when I try to apply Newton's Third Law to explain politics to my kids: ""For every stupid thing someone says, there will be an equal (if not more) stupid thing said in response.""So when I read ""What If..."", Randall Munroe's collection of his What If? website's (http://what-if.xkcd.com/) more popular articles, there was a bit of melancholy and a tinge of envy. Here, after all, was someone doing really cool things with his physics degree.Then I enjoyed the book so ******* much I did not care.Disclaimer: I am a big Munroe fan (literally, if you'd seen my bathroom scale, you'd know), and read his main XKCD webcomic and What If? sites regularly. So much of this book came as no surprise. What appeals to me about Munroe's works if that while he is a scientist by trade, he seems to have the heart of a poet and satirist. He knows his math and his science, and there is also wit and charm and quite a bit of humor to his art and writing. Some of the humor is dark, but then so are some of the results of the hypothetical questions he gets.This is a book for anyone to read if they have even the most cursory interest in science. And everyone else should read it to get their interest stoked."

712,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,5,"“What If?” is this in a nutshell: imagine you have a completely random, yet somewhat science-related question. Now imagine that someone who is really smart, really funny, really diligent about research, and really good at explaining complex things in understandable terms takes your question seriously.Randall Munroe is this someone. I am very familiar with his XKCD work, and it’s addictive. The material in this book is also online, so if you’ve perused that webpage, there’s nothing “new” here. Even still, this book is enjoyable, and the writing and layout is pretty good. Obviously, if you’re into science and geeky things, this book is for you. I mean, who doesn’t want to know if you can launch yourself into the air with the power of an AK-47 or why we can’t drop a nuclear bomb into a volcano or hurricane to put a stop to the destructive power of nature (not recommended, by the way)? The best part are those bizarre facts the reader can store away, facts that can be presented in random conversation for no reason, just because you KNOW stuff about stuff.This is NOT a textbook with mundane questions and boring answers to those questions. This is in all actuality a well-thought out book pondering the questions many (unusual) people have, and not really knowing who to turn to for answers. Why not ask the XKCD guy? This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun by inserting them into an exploration of “what would happen if an impossible something” happened, leading to sobering, and often humorous conclusions.One other thing to note about this book: it is perfect to read in “chunks”, that is, reading a chapter or two at a time. Although, be forewarned, once this book is started, it is pretty hard to put down. Highly recommended!"

But it seemed really smart, so, if it seems smart it must = accurate.5/5 for humor. Seriously, most of the articles had me giggling, chuckling, or hysterically laughing at least once. I even dropped the book from cackling so hard. And, I appreciated that. This could have been dry and dull, but Munroe wouldn't allow that. He kept it entertaining and enlightening.5/5 for the questions picked. There are some really interesting questions in here. I wish I thought to ask some of them, but luckily, there are plenty of individuals in this world willing to ask the tough questions, like:""What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning, but the atmosphere retained its velocity?""Or""If every human somehow simply disappeared from the face of the Earth, how long would it be before the last artificial light source go out?""Or""What would happen if you made a periodic table out of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?""Of course, there were some questions too weird and worrisome which Munroe refused to answer, luckily he added them in for our enjoyment.And finally 5/5 for the art/comics Munroe added to coincide with the articles. They helped really bring each answer to laugh, while adding in an additional element to the humor.I cannot recommend this book fast enough if you haven't read it!

716,0544272994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am deeply suspicious whenever a book is sold on the basis that its author is in some sense famous, so I was immediately wary of Randall Munroe's What If, especially as the book was plastered with references to his internet science cartoon site xkcd. The press release gets even more excited, proclaiming 'Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer, the genius behind XKCD.com.' Damn him with faint praise, won't you? This isn't helped by the fact that the few times I've seen Munroe's stick cartoons, usually re-spread on social media, I haven't found them at all funny. So it was almost a disappointment when I discovered that I really liked this book.Munro gives detailed answers to weird questions asked from readers on his website. Questions like 'If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change colour?' and 'How much Force power can Yoda output?' There are even some questions that Munroe shakes his head and retreats from - things like 'How many houses are burned down in the US every year? What would be the easiest way to increase the number by a significant amount (say, at least 15%)?'The answers given are light hearted, but take the challenge seriously and with some impressive back-of-an-envelope calculation and a touch of research deliver convincing answers. There is a distinguished precedent in taking absurd suggestions (admittedly self-generated) and using them to explore the realities of science in George Gamow's classic (if now rather difficult to read) Mr Tompkins books where, for instance, he explores what would happen if the speed of light reduced to a walking pace.The main problem with Gamow's books is that they suffer from an excess of whimsy, which was considered funny at the time, something that Munroe does occasional succumb to in his footnotes. Two other slight problems with What If are that some of the problems are so silly that it's easy to think 'So what?' and after a while the format gets a bit samey.However, it's hard not to admire the straight faced aplomb with which Munroe deals with weird problem after weird problem - and often takes them so far over the top they become more interesting still. (For instance when asking a question about a hair dryer in a box, he considers the outcome for different powers of hair dryers up to 11 petawatts, which is considerably more than the EU likes to allow for electrical goods. (Sorry, the whimsy is catching.) ) The fact is this is a very likeable and fun book that should entertain many readers."

Munroe creates the hilarious webcomic xkcd, and I guess he also solicits hypothetical questions from readers. This book is a collection of some of his great responses to a series of these questions. For example, when a reader lobs the idea, ""What would happen if the Earth stopped rotating but the air kept moving?"" Munroe gets to the immediate answer (winds at ridiculous speeds, all over the world, all at once), then he goes on delightful explorations, like describing how the damage would happen (maybe X building would be OK from the wind, but it would still get destroyed by windborne debris), theorizing about the fascinating physics that would happen on ocean surfaces, contemplating which cities have enough subterranean architecture to sustain human life for a little while, and eventually ending his essay with a theory of what would get the planet spinning again. The science is backed up by sources at the back of the book (except, comically, when he'll make a claim like ""The ocean is really deep"" and throw in a [citation needed] reference), and adorable cartoons bring in side jokes and illustrate some of the trickier concepts.Some of the best chapters have little to do with science at all. Like, when a reader asks what would happen if everyone in the world jumped in the same place at the same time, the answer is simple (the planet outweighs the weight of humanity by so much that there would be no effect), so the essay gets into the logistical nightmares in the aftermath of billions of people gathering in one place. And there are some funny interstitials with disturbing questions that go unanswered, except by sarcastic one-panel comics.I'm not someone who would spend a lot of time on a book about physics. But I'll spend a lot of time on a humor book. Munroe has someone like me in mind when he writes this book, and I suspect that most readers will love it too."
