1,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,5,"I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of 9/11 and the world in the new millennium, a strife-torn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment. I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over. And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the 'neutrinos being speedier than light particles' experiment that had made the headlines a few years ago.I can only imagine because he wasn't there to witness these watershed events and he isn't here to offer comment, criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer. His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work - a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universe(s). 
""Our familiar universe of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in the next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.""
It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the 13 chapters of 'Cosmos' and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time, the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet. I could write a review in the conventional format, leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you can.Or, instead, I could simply write about how, despite being more than 30 years outdated, Carl Sagan's voice of reason rings truer than ever, cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times. I could just tell you how Sagan's deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries, across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides, symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge.
""There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised.""
The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history, the Soviet Union is no more, America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President. But turmoil in the world order persists - the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region. The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past, if not more. Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits, blatant human rights violations, infringement on freedom of speech and expression, diplomatic arm-wrestling, the ever-enthusiastic decriers of science, 'War on Women', the shouts of the global-warming deniers reign supreme still. The players may have changed faces but the game of petty one-upmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabated.Which is why Sagan's rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being. His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances, of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority, impresses upon us a sense of urgency - that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers, the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced. As the concept of 'nuclear deterrence' receives a pat on the back, the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control, more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars, galaxies and universes. The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominy.Is it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria, the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes, Democritus, Aristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Christiaan Huygens, Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for? To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete self-annihilation?Sagan thinks not.
""Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for the Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""
 This is why I can't help but agree quite heartily with someone who says 'If I had a religion, I would be a Carl Saganian.'
""If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""
If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith, let it be this one."
2,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,5,"The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book. Gosh, I should not use the term ‘absolutely’ for something in which everything orbits around relativity.Anyway, I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book: my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars, …and expanding. My rating:What a brilliant read this has been. I have read it very slowly; one chapter a week. But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time? I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs. What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room, bringing home and explaining to me, the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable time.Sagan’s mind is truly cosmic, in scope and in outlook. We accompany him as he pulls together history, with the pre-Socratic, the Alexandrians, Leonardo, Kepler and Tycho Brahe, Huygens, Einstein, with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy. I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa, in a true Pasolini manner. I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his half-observed-half-fictional universe. I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft, realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early 1980s when Sagan’s program and book were all the rage, and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitous.I loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid, when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses. Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy. Unforgettable.The contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universe--the language of science--, which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions. But a running argument, and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program, is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies: superstition and violence.Produced during the Cold War, the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of self-destruction. His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projection.But the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being. But also how, in spite of my own insignificance, how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elements.Rather than depressing, I have found this thought heartening. A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lasts.Which means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium, invented by us. Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian Library.He understood."

I'm glad I did; I was able to project the image and voice of Carl Sagan into the words on the page. If there is a better science related, non-fiction book out there, please, someone point it out to me.Revised Oct. 2017."
4,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397575-daniella,5,"I'm not sure what I could possibly say about Cosmos that hasn't already been said by countless others in the 28 years since its publication, and likely in a far more intelligent and eloquent way than I ever could. But upon recently reading this book for the first time (which may seem a bit belated, but I am, after all, only 23) it instantly became one of my favorites, a status not easily attained by any book, and so I feel compelled to say something, to expound upon its many virtues and why it has endeared itself to me so completely.""One glance at [a book:] and you hear the voice of another person--perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time.""Perhaps prophetically, this is exactly the effect the late great Dr. Sagan acheived with this book. Through the power and fluid elegance of his prose, while reading Cosmos I could almost hear that familiar and somehow majestic voice (which in large part, I believe, made the PBS miniseries of the same name so wholly entrancing), as if the two of us were old friends having a leisurely, albeit profoundly intellectual, chat over coffee. Not exactly what one might expect from a book largely concerned with science, but this is just one of many qualities that makes it not only endearing to the reader, but also--and perhaps more importantly--accessible, making even the smattering of complex equations seem casual and undaunting.Aside from the beauty of its prose, which is at times poetic in its depth and its eloquence, Cosmos is also wholly engaging and fascinating in the depth and scope of its subects. Sagan succinctly and expertly covers everything from the birth of stars to the birth of science, the origins of life on Earth to the possibility of life on other planets, and our far distant and recent (in the grand cosmic scheme of things) past to the possibilities for our distant future. And yes, because science is constantly evolving and, as Dr. Sagan states, self-correcting, some of the information and theories covered may now be outdated, but I still believe that Cosmos is well worth reading. Not only can it serve as a friendly, accessible, and engrossing jumping-off point for we common folk who are interested in delving deeper into science but may feel a bit intimidated, it is also, if nothing else, worth reading for the beautifully poignant and evocative insights and the oft-philosophical tidbits contained therein.""We are the local embodiment of the Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars....""My only complaints about Cosmos are these: the last two or three chapters lag just a bit, incorporating several topics that seem extraneous and unnecessary, and somewhat lose the smooth, easy flow present throughout the rest of the book; and though I feel that, in the current world political climate, the section discussing nuclear arms is still as relevant today as then, I can't help but think that anybody above the age of 12 and possessing a fully-functioning cerebral cortex is already aware of the potential consequences of nuclear war (gamma burst, radiation poisoning, junk in the atmosphere, nuclear winter, death, doom, destruction, we get it already). However, I can concede on this last point that, at the time of publication, the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war was perhaps still a pretty hot topic. And in the grand scheme, these negative points make up only a negligible fraction of this otherwise fantastic book, and do not in anyway detract from its intrinsic value or from its overall enjoyability.All in all, Cosmos is a thoroughly enthralling read that takes you on a breath-taking journey from the inception of the Universe to futures that may never be, and allows us to ponder--when considering our own epic journey from starstuff to ""assemblages of a billion billion billion atoms contemplating the evolution of atoms""--what it truly means to be human and what our place, our purpose, is in the vast expanse of ""this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky""."

These flaws center on either Sagan's unusual speaking style and acting(?) abilities, or the show's contents. I certainly agree that he looks stupid when displaying the ""awed"" look; however, the complaints about the content of his shows are not justified. Yes, he is short on reasons and long on visual effects, and, yes, he talks as if the viewer did not know the obvious. What we are all forgetting is this: the average person doesn't know what we would consider ""obvious"". We should realize that Carl Sagan has his work cut out for him making science digestible for the average person."

Stars borrowed from skies that I witnessed when I was eight or maybe ten and would wake up early at pre-dawn, because that was the best time for star gazing after all. To read Mr.Sagan, the words so simple describing the Universe so complex. To read a small passage and follow it up with a sleep filled with dreams of all those stars dying and being born every passing moment.To recall, days of childish innocence gazing towards the infinite.Gazing in anticipation of recognizing a constellation or an anticipated meteor shower.To pause while reading and reflect, wonder. To attempt understanding things with closed eyes.To hear back from the infinite, after all these many years. Because thoughts might after all travel through vacuum.To think what has been thought centuries ago, but not by you yet.To take a possibility, and create countless possibilities.To be curious, to question. To look at things with not just your eyes. To be looked back from an infinite distance, with your own eyes.To the journeys we could take each night, only if we gave ourselves the chance to.To Pause.To realize that this moment ephemeral as it is, and only one among a multiple of possible moments,still IS."
7,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286151-z,5,"Let's put it simply. Cosmos is required reading for everyone who lives on this planet. It will give you a sense of perspective that nothing else can -- no lofty ideology, no omniscient religion, no inspiring quotations can explain things quite as clearly as Carl Sagan's treatise on science, reality, and the nature of things in this universe. Mind-bending and dazzling, and best of all, uncluttered by confusing scientific terminology. A book worthy of all the positive superlatives I can think of bestowing on it.We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilisations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densey populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.- Carl Sagan, Cosmos"
8,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,4,"Carl Sagan was a good writer. For a scientist, his prose had a literary style that is enjoyable to read, and he injected a sense of philosophy into his passionate account of the origins and marvels of the cosmos. I do find that the delivery was quite heavy-handed in trying to instill that sense of awe and wonder into the reader. What made it even more so was the narrator whose intonation carries a quality of breathless resonance. The arrangement of the subject matter also seemed a bit haphazard in my view. I couldn't help comparing this book to a favourite of mine - A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson which was organised, concise, informative, and very entertaining. Regardless, Cosmos is still a good primer to read for those who are interested in learning more about the universe and our world before venturing into more recent writings from the likes of Stephen Hawkings (may he rest in peace) and Neil deGrasse Tyson."
9,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"Re-visit 2016:1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean: After an introduction by Ann Druyan, including the benefits of the end of the Cold War, Carl Sagan opens the program with a description of the cosmos and a ""Spaceship of the Imagination"" (shaped like a dandelion seed). The ship journeys through the universes' hundred billion galaxies, the Local Group, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, the Orion Nebula, our Solar System, and finally the planet Earth. Eratosthenes' attempt to calculate the circumference of Earth leads to a description of the ancient Library of Alexandria. Finally, the ""Ages of Science"" are described, before pulling back to the full span of the Cosmic Calendar. 2: One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue : Sagan discusses the story of the Heike crab and artificial selection of crabs resembling samurai warriors, as an opening into a larger discussion of evolution through natural selection (and the pitfalls of the theory of intelligent design). Among the topics are the development of life on the Cosmic Calendar and the Cambrian explosion; the function of DNA in growth; genetic replication, repairs, and mutation; the common biochemistry of terrestrial organisms; the creation of the molecules of life in the Miller-Urey experiment; and speculation on alien life (such as life in Jupiter's clouds). In the Cosmos Update ten years later, Sagan remarks on RNA also controlling chemical reactions and reproducing itself and the different roles of comets (potentially carrying organic molecules or causing the Cretaceous--Tertiary extinction event)This episode is worth 6* just on its ownHeaven and Hell: Sagan discusses comets and asteroids as planetary impactors, giving recent examples of the Tunguska event and a lunar impact described by Canterbury monks in 1178. It moves to a description of the environment of Venus, from the previous fantastic theories of people such as Immanuel Velikovsky to the information gained by the Venera landers and its implications for Earth's greenhouse effect. The Cosmos Update highlights the connection to global warming. 1908 Siberia Tunguska5: Blues for a red planet: The episode, devoted to the planet Mars, begins with scientific and fictional speculation about the Red Planet during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Edgar Rice Burroughs' science fiction books, and Percival Lowell's false vision of canals on Mars). It then moves to Robert Goddard's early experiments in rocket-building, inspired by reading science fiction, and the work by Mars probes, including the Viking, searching for life on Mars. The episode ends with the possibility of the terraforming and colonization of Mars and a Cosmos Update on the relevance of Mars' environment to Earth's and the possibility of a manned mission to Mars.6: Traveller's Tales: The journeys of the Voyager probes is put in the context of the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, with a centuries-long tradition of sailing ship explorers, and its contemporary thinks (such as Constantijn Huygens and his son Christian). Their discoveries are compared to the Voyager probes' discoveries among the Jovian and Saturn systems. In Cosmos Update, image processing reconstructs Voyager's worlds and Voyager's last portrait of the Solar System as it leaves is shown.Definitely need an up-to-date version with all that has been discovered since this was published in 1980"
10,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"“ The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us - there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries. ”With these lines, we hop on Sagan’s ‘ship of imagination’ to visit distant worlds of Quasars, Pulsars, Black holes and Galaxies that are billions of light years away from us. A peak into the Cosmos. Sagan is a poet-scientist, he uses beautiful metaphors and aphorisms that are never too far from what an ordinary person can grasp. The style is lucid. The knowledge ranges from Mathematics to history, from ancient Greece to NASA. Building on the works of geniuses who introduced us to this fascinating, mind boggling universe of ours.After giving us a general idea of our ‘cosmic address’, Sagan moves on to Darwin and his discovery of Natural Selection as the engine of Evolution. This has to be one of the finest explanations of Darwinian Natural Selection, where Sagan uses the extra-ordinary example Heike crabs, to demonstrate the strange but beautiful ways in which ‘survival of the fittest’ is manifested. But he doesn’t keep us here for long. After giving the best possible ‘lecture’ on Evolution, he takes us further to see the harmony of the worlds. the planets and how the stars follow fixed patterns that can be mathematically explained; a most singular achievement of humans to have discovered the language of the Nature. Kepler gave us the laws of planetary motion. Laws that not just explained the elliptical orbit of Earth, but inspired a generation of mathematicians and physicists to inquire further into the nature and behaviour of the heavenly bodies.  A world so strange, complex and inaccessible has been made fascinating, understandable and rather accessible by the works of men and women who devoted their lives to Science and Cosmos. A world that is far more rich and awe-inspiring than the meagre and myth-ridden fairytales that we content ourselves with. We settle for too little. As the book progresses, Sagan’s obsession with extra-terrestrial life becomes more and more apparent. He admits that as a child, he spent hours contemplating about the possibility of intelligent life on other planets. Although our search for intelligent life has been a failure (even on Earth), Sagan aspires to make contact with the dwellers of distant worlds. The possibility of life elsewhere, is not too ‘fantastic’ altogether. As we observe the immensity of the observable universe, we can be more than certain that life does exist elsewhere but we don’t know what it will be like. Space travel and Alien Contact are not stuff of science fiction anymore but a possibility in waiting. The concluding chapters touch on two matters of colossal significance, namely Nuclear Weapons and Climate Change. These two man-made disasters are a ticking time bomb that can obliterate our species, and we have done precious little to stop them. We are destroying this planet, poisoning our oceans and destroying Specie after specie for centuries now. Man is without a doubt the most deadly predator in the history of Earth Life. And now we are on the path to self-annihilation. And this book is a wakeup call. A world ridden with ignorance and greed, will need to forego the idiotic bliss of being certain about everything. We don’t need good answers to everything, what we need instead are good questions. A good question is often times more educating than its answer. How can we love this world if we are awaiting an apocalypse, how can we love our environment and its safe keepers, the plants and the animals, without recognising that they are our distant cousins. Life, wherever it exists on this planet, is our kin. And we are bullying, butchering and asphyxiating it everywhere. What a shame !This is the kind of book that we must read and re-read. A book we must gift our children on their 12th birthdays. If you haven’t read it yet and you are over 12, do your self a favour and read it.Because Carl Sagan does more than just educate you about the wonders of Science and the Universe; he makes you fall in love with it."

13,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13631093-speranza,5,"As a child, I was fascinated and mesmerised by our world. It looked so huge, so full of wonders. Еverything was a source of marvel and inspiration. The world, the Earth, waited to be discovered and I had a long life ahead of me to do that. Then, in teenage years, I already knew all there was to know about life, people, the Earth and the Universe. Nobody could tell me any better. The new source of wonder had become love – falling in love, finding the purpose in another human being, the complete merging of body and soul.Once I entered the world of adults, I realised that I knew nothing. I strived for a higher purpose which, it turned out, was extremely hard to find in between a daily job that gives you no thrill, the same four walls you hide behind every night, and the usual faces that say the same words day in day out. The mundanity and routine that sustain a human life make it really hard to notice this same life. Wine and poetry help the cause to some extent, but they pull one out of Earth’s gravity for very short instances only.I have been at a crossroads lately, which shattered the illusive security of existence and made me anxious, itching with questions, sleepless, feeling an urge I couldn’t define. And then I started to seek answers, cosmic answers.Suddenly, it feels like a meteorite has hit my little planet. I read with eyes wide-open, with the naïveté of a toddler, with a remarkable ignorance and with an insatiable thirst to learn more. I feel like a child again! I feel in love again! I feel my senses being heightened and my pulse rushing. Carl Sagan made me feel like a scientist. For I have made a wonderful discovery - the nutrient of my little earthly life is curiosity – no step for the Cosmos, one giant leap for the cosmic speck of dust that I am.I could talk for hours about how beautiful and captivating I found Cosmos to be. It made me crave knowledge of the unknown. It made my underdeveloped imagination burst with colourful visions. It made my stunted mind race. I savoured every word, embraced every idea. I guess for someone who has read a lot on the subject I look like a newly hatched chicken, struggling to make its first steps. I have been intimidated by physics and chemistry all my life and now it is time to catch up.My gut tells me that Sagan is not right in completely rejecting astrology, the occult or religion, but I choose to trust him because he has managed to put into simple words concepts that have scared away so many people for so long. His narrative voice is the perfect combination of a bright mind and humility. It is subtle and guiding, not patronizing. It is human and it is humane – it makes you believe you can understand and dream beyond the boundaries of your own mind.Sagan was a great scientist, but I think his greatest achievement is that he made science accessible and interesting to his fellow human beings. His venture to bring the Cosmos closer to humans might eventually pay off in helping bring humans closer to the Cosmos. There is so much more I want to say, but I don’t have words for all thoughts that Cosmos provoked in me. I feel ashamed that my review of this monumental work revolves around my little nichtigkeit, but, after all, even the biggest galaxies are made of the smallest particles."
14,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,5,"A gorgeous book in every possible way. From the lush illustration and clever diagrams clear through to Sagan's lyrical and at times whimsical narrative, this is the science book for non-scientists. (And if you are a scientist, may this be a lesson in how to tell your story.) Sagan makes the astronomy and the math and the mind-boggling complexity of the universe not only comprehensible but palatable. He wraps up our history as a species into the history of the universe (such that we can even know it).As a kid, I adored this book for the color plates. I would flip the pages in my Dad's copy over and over and over again. Down on the floor, on the couch -- anywhere. Probably every day from ages four through seventeen. I didn't go on to be an astronomer. Hell, I never took a physics class and I nearly failed more than one math class (as I recall) but this book...Reading it cover-to-cover for the first time as an adult, I was struck by many things. The book is dense but Sagan paces it well, makes you hungry for every anecdote about Kepler or Pythagoras, thirsty for the decimal-laden scientific notation.And then there was the moment that blew my mind; tucked away in a footnote about telescopic ""snapshots"" of galaxies:...The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small.!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
15,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70913-deb,1,"This book was my bible when I was an enemy of God. As a stubbornly devout atheist, this was the book I turned to for justification of my proud and arrogant rejection of my Creator. Instead of reading this pile of conjecture, I recommend reading the Holy Bible (then get on your knees and repent before the holy God who gave you life and sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for your lawlessness and sin). :-)"
16,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Sagan explores the history and future of cosmology with wonder and foreboding in this slightly dated but insightful and still highly relevant mix of science and philosophy. He begins with the story of Eratosthenes, the first to calculate the circumference of the earth in the third century BCE. His instruments were two sticks. He placed one vertically in the ground at the summer solstice on the equator and a second 800 kilometers north. At noon the first would give no shadow but the angle of the shadow of the second would correspond to that segment of the earth. Divide the angle (7 degrees) into 360, multiply it by 800 and you are pretty close to the actual circumference. Simple but brilliant!In the 6th century BCE Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras began laying the foundations of modern scientific thought from astronomy to mathematics to biology. The 6th century not only produced these brilliant Ionian Greeks, but Gautama Buddha in India, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Zoroaster in Persia, and Pharaoh Necho in Egypt who had Africa circumnavigated 2000 years before the Portuguese. Sagan questions whether this simultaneous explosion of new ideas could really be unrelated, but doesn’t suggest an answer. Unfortunately this burst of innovative thought wouldn’t last. Sagan points to the destruction of the library at Alexandria in the fourth century CE as a final blow to learning symbolizing the beginning of the Dark Ages. It would be another 1,000 years for this ancient knowledge to be rediscovered although much would be lost forever. Sagan suggests the rise of slavery led to the demise of the Ionian scientists. Slavery obviated the need for technology and set up the need for clear lines of demarcation of class to justify it. Thus working with the hands, engaging in ungentlemanly activity was wrong. Religion was employed to rationalize the institution. Today we are familiar with a more recent example, the antebellum South which failed to industrialize due to its reliance on slavery and ended up falling far behind the North.Sagan covers the 16th and 17th century contributions of Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, and Newton. Then he skips to the 1970’s discussing the Voyager missions, exploration of the solar system and the prospects for finding life. He presents the then current ideas on the nature of the universe discussing stars, space, time and the exploration of the galaxy. Sagan is particularly focused on the use of radio astronomy not only to identify far flung civilizations but to contact them. Cosmos was written before string theory, the multiverse, supersymmetry, dark matter, dark energy and the Higgs boson became hot topics. Still his discussion holds up well. Sagan is enamored with interacting with other civilizations. I am not sure this is a good idea but danger from aliens seems far less likely than danger from our fellow man. In trying to calculate the number of advanced civilizations in the universe, a key factor is how long a civilization can last before it destroys itself. We have only very recently gotten to the point where we can reach out to other worlds and between climate change, nuclear war, and other self-destructive behavior our future is clearly tenuous. Sagan takes this worry very seriously and persuades me to as well. Perhaps our search for intelligent life on other worlds has borne no fruit because intelligent life is a misnomer. "

The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we've learned most of what we know. Recently, we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from.We long to returnand we can .because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of starstuff 
i don't think i'll ever give 5 stars more wholeheartedly as i am doing now ..5 shimmering , eye-blindingly shinning stars , the brightest suns GR has in its this little galaxy should be owned by this book , cosmos .its really shocking that only days ago i didnt know who carl sagan is . The name may have seemed a bit familiar , but nothing more Now , this name feels too meaningful , i'd remember this man's words , his deep voice discussing the formations of the stars and their decay and deaths , i'd surly remember the passion in his eyes in the parallel Cosmos TV show , the way he pronounces Billions and Billions stressing on the B or the way he says  ""we are made of starstuff"" with too much longing . I LOVED THIS BOOK  it maybe mainstream and often said but i dont know how to phrase what i feel about it any other way , seems its beyond my ability of putting things into coherent sentences .it was Beautiful  in every mean , i wish now that i have saved every beautiful i've ever used , ever said , so that when i call this peace of heaven beautiful you would get what i am saying ..quoting from the same book , cosmos is :
""visually and musically stunning, and to engage the heart as well as the mind""
Carl Sagan , an astronomer, a cosmologist and a writer. a brilliant man . the way he uses words , it doesnt feel decorated , these words are written too honestly , the passions and ambitions of a man ,once a child inlove with science-fiction as we all are , scriped in papers .I feel too ashamed that i am 22 years living in this world and its only now that i read this book , Cosmos wasn't only about astronomy , but philosophy , biology and a big deal of history all written very beautifully you will enjoy every bit , i started to love radio waves , Phythagorean laws and things of this sort that i may have considered dry and lifeless in my school years . its hard to believe that this is written in the eighties of the last century , may be so much had changed , maybe some stuff here and there are not up to date but its is still a big source of inspiration . The question about extraterrestial life remains a puzzle , but exploring the problem is a fascinating journey in itself .I am not an expert on natural science , a mere starter , but it was easy for me to read , so i think carl sagan's books are gems of some sort , they are the bridge between scientists and common people , they are written for us , we who love the stars and crave to understand them yet we are no scientists or experts our selves . and generally expertise in the subject matter is not required to enjoy it , as the love of it shall demonstrates. I am officaily recommending this book for every human being , its a thing every soul should read .i wish i can buy enough copies for the human race and shove them down their doors . 
""Finally, at the end of all our wanderings, we return to our tiny, fragile, blue-white world, lost in a cosmic ocean vast beyond our most courageous imaginings. It is a world among an immensity of others. It may be significant only for us. The Earth is our home, our parent. Our kind of life arose and evolved here. The human species is coming of age here. It is on this world that we developed our passion for exploring the Cosmos, and it is here that we are, in some pain and with no guarantees, working out our destiny """"There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another""
Warning ! : dont you ever miss meeting the deep voice narrating to you the story of the cosmos , watch the TV show , meet carl sagan , I'll put links for the 13 episodes downwards .Advice : read the book with some cosmic music , it will feel magical and out of the world .The TV show episodes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ9mz...i've read it as an ebook copy and i think half the book is marked blue , its just too charming you would want to remember every word , now i have my pockets full of fascinating quotes . and these are some i couldn't resist including in the review :* They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky*We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever*Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations*The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion* (1033, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called compelling. Worlds are precious*Each star system is an island in space, quarantined from its neighbors by the light- years. I can imagine creatures evolving into glimmerings of knowledge on innumerable worlds, every one of them assuming at first their puny planet and paltry few suns to be all that is. We grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves the Cosmos*Welcome to the planet Earth - a place of blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water, cool forests and soft meadows, a world positively rippling with life. In the cosmic perspective it is, as I have said, poignantly beautiful and rare; but it is also, for the moment, unique*The study of the heavens brought Ptolemy a kind of ecstasy. ‘ Mortal as I am,’ he wrote, ‘ I know that I am born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth. . *With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist . . . I yield freely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the book - to be read either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness*With searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and everything suffused in an eerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the goddess of love than the incarnation of hell*All that matters is the evidence, and the evidence is not yet in.*The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished*there are regularities in Nature that permit its secrets to be uncovered. Nature is not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered and admirable character of the universe was called Cosmos*Traveling close to the speed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down close to the speed of light, special relativity provides us with a means of going to the stars*A star is a phoenix, destined to rise for a time from its own ashes*Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival*Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species*The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons. The radio and radar techniques employed to track and guide ballistic missiles and defend against attack are also used to monitor and command the spacecraft on the planets and to listen for signals from civilizations near other stars. If we use these technologies to destroy ourselves, we surely will venture no more to the planets and the stars. But the converse is also true. If we continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will be shaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will recognize that our explorations can be carried out only on behalf of all the people of the planet Earth"
19,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33085883-benjamin-or-so-they-say,5,"This is the closest I have ever been to love.This book is not only a huge source of knowledge for those looking forward to getting enthralled into the science of cosmos, but also one that I know has a special meaning for some people out there. Both of the before mentioned apply to me, but why do I say it has a special meaning? Well, as simple as it may sound, this book was what took me to where I am right now. There has always been magic for me. As a kid, I always believed in everything everyone else seemed to despise and so it was my faith that my parents even got to think that I was crazy.First, there were these magical creatures: faeries, mermaids, goblins, wizards, etc. Then something even better and more magical came to my life: science. Now you may be thinking, okay, but science is a wide subject, what part of science? And I will answer you: why do I have to choose from it when I can learn from all of it? That’s something taught me. Science is connected to everything in ways that some of us have never imagined. If we talk about science, we must think of it as the most important discovery in the history of humanity, of art, religion, music, and beauty in its fullest expression. One can’t live without the other, they are the things that give form and purpose to our existence. Since I find myself unfit to give a decent critic to the book (not because I lack knowledge but for the role, it played and keeps playing in my life), I’m going to invite you to think a little bit.Imagine yourself as a 6-year old kid. You are in the countryside, separated from any sound or human contact, and the only light is the one that comes from the starts you are currently watching. You feel happy about your loneliness. You don’t know anything about the matter and yet you have a feeling that there’s some magic in the sky, some kind of spell written in it. Suddenly the stars are passing by, leaving a blur of light on their tray and you wonder how some stars can move and fall while others keep doing their job, brightening everything around you. You run to the house at the other side of the camp, and turn to see the stars again, they are still there, the same stars every day, you are scared because you don’t understand and that makes you feel uneasy. You go to sleep. Next morning you wake up and go directly to the nearest library, you ask for books of stars, but the librarian tells you she has none and instead she gives you a physics, religion and art books, what a disappointment you think. You see the pictures and read as much as you can, it isn’t an easy task, though, you have barely learned to read. The hours passed by, and by the end of the day, you realized how much you have learned, not only about physics and stars but also about religion, math, and arts. It’s then when you as a 6-years old kid find the most valuable treasure when you were only looking to understand the stars. As I said before, there is no way of reviewing this book correctly."
20,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938805-brian,5,"This is one of those kind of books that comes along every few years that is so fantastic that you purposely drag out reading it in order to savor its awesomeness. It doesn't matter that it was written 25+ years ago, pre-Hubble telescope, before the fall of the USSR, etc. - Sagan's insight and wide-reaching scope are timeless.The last few chapters are so rich in thought-provoking information they are worth re-reading. Sagan would have never wanted his work to become the foundation of a religion, but I can see why so many people refer to this as their ""bible"" and use it to help make sense out of a mad world and one's short time to inhabit it."

This is one of the best popular scientific books that I have read. This book is well written, reads like a mystery novel and is a great source of interesting information. Scientific information is explained in ""simple reader"" language.The focus in this book is on astronomy : how big is our universe, how old it is, how it ""works"", etc. Sagan pays a lot of attention to stars and galaxies, but also presents the more advanced topics of black holes and pulsars. There are also occasional earthly detours - evolution of life on earth, ancient greeks, the library of Alexandria, voyages of explorers, etc. The book also tries to bring up some philosophical questions, especially in relation to the possibility of other civilizations in the cosmos, and how a contact between us and them would happen.Highly recommendation!===================

This book is really very impressive. A story of 15 billion years of the cosmos compressed in this relatively smaller book! Easy to read and understand, Carl Sagan's Cosmos draws the reader into a world so vivid and realistic that it's hard not to be mesmerized throughout while reading this book."
24,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3," I wish I had LOVED this book as Carl Sagan is an icon. It was entertaining, if you ignore the fact that it is VERY dated (I mean, 40+ years dated), which is not its fault. However, I much prefer A Short History of Nearly Everything for a review of the same information. "
25,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Cosmos operates at a massive scale worthy of its lofty title. Carl Sagan, in a companion compendium to his 13-part 1980 TV series of the same name, explains what we know about the universe and the progression of human thought about origins and the nature of reality. We zoom across frames of reference, from the actions of atoms and subatomic particles, to the molecules that store genetic information, to life on this planet, and beyond, to the structure of the universe. We learn about the various explorations of Mars, Venus, Io and Europa, and how we might travel to stars in the future. Along the way, Sagan explains not just what we know, but how we know it, and the fascinating stories of how that information was discovered: often by brilliance or persistence, and sometimes by historical accident or sheer luck. His enthusiasm is readily apparent: infectious and infused with a positive vision for the world and the future. One can only wish that more people on Earth shared Sagan's perspective.The book is punctuated with quotes from various myths of the universe's origins, which serve to remind us how important these questions have always been, but also how poorly equipped we are to access answers through intuition alone. It is the scientific method that has allowed us to cumulatively add new knowledge. He quotes Seneca, from the first century CE: ""There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate... Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all."" Seneca saw clearly, and Sagan shares the stories of thinkers like Pythagoras, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Huygens, Newton and Einstein and the various contributions they made to our modern understanding.I listened to the audio version, read by LeVar Burton, which is fantastic. I then picked up my physical copy to re-read the quotes and footnotes and see the included charts and illustrations. I highly recommend this for everyone... even if you have a strong understanding of science, it is worth it just to hear Sagan's brilliant and beautifully crafted explanations."
26,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36595208-n-rmin,5,"It took me long to read it, but it was worth it. First thing that captivates me that despite being a nonfiction scientific book, Carl Sagan described the whole universe, explained the science in such a poetic and eloquent way that you would think he is a romantic poet! And the parts about his childhood and his enthusiasm for astronomy, for cosmos were the cutest and beautiful thing I have ever read. I saw myself, my passion for space in him, in his writings. And best part of this book was the incredible ideas that can belong to a sci-fi writer! I even took notes from this ideas so maybe I can use them in my future writings. Carl Sagan became my favorite person in science))) And this book will be forever my favorite and I am sure I will read it again and again and also recommend it as a teacher)) And these are my favorite quotes:“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” “What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“we make our world significant by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers”"

28,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"When do we truly die ? The most logical answer would be to say that we die when the last breath escapes us and when our body and mind cease to function. But I tend to differ , death would be the loss of fascination and wonderment at the world around us. To wake up and see the sun rise everyday, to listen to birdsong in the mornings and see the blue sky above you, to feel the rain lashing at you and at times caressing you with its softness, the gentle breeze of the evenings, the feel of the sea waves beneath your toes....this is life ! And when a time arrives during which none of this can be felt with the same sense of wanton bliss, I shall call it death. If ever there arises a world like Cormac McCarthy's The Road envisaged, I would go insane in a couple of days at the most ! This digression is very much in line with Carl Sagan's work for he speaks to us about our home : Earth. His voice is one of clear reason and indefatigable energy that I was filled with a sense of elation to say the least. You hold his hand and walk with him, a kid who for the first time stepped into a science class with eyes as wide and big as glass marbles ! Even when he tells you that you are nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in the order of things in the galaxy, he continues to say  But look around you, isn't the Earth the most beautiful thing you ever saw ?  Sagan conducts a virtual tour through the history of human civilizations, astronomy, the rise of science, interstellar and interplanetary travel and also ponders for a chapter on the perceived nature of extra terrestrial intelligence. What makes it marvelous reading ? One word : Simplicity ! He never writes a word that a common man needs to break his head over. Yes, there are graphical representations and equations galore in the book but even if you skip them and keep reading you will not be at a loss. Things are kept to the simplest way possible, a spade is called a spade and there are no unnecessary theatrics. I have not seen the TV series that inspired this book but am surely going to go in search of it ! Recommended for those with a love for nature and science."
29,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45702383-a-l-buehrer,2," Let me just say this, I love science as much as anybody else, but I can love it without getting weird about it.  I guess I was expecting this book to be something it wasn't. It's really just a humanist philosophy book. I was expecting to learn something. I read science books to stretch my mind, not to be preached at. This was the preachiest science book I have ever read. Carl Sagan obviously literally worships science. This book was really just a hymn to science, not really delving into any particular part of it enough to really be interesting. I was disappointed enough in Sagan's writing to seriously consider taking ""The Pale Blue Dot"" off my reading list. His tone is so condescending. I decided to read it anyway. Just to give him a second chance. I'm just saying, he's not making my favorite authors list by any means. "

31,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,5,"I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of 9/11 and the world in the new millennium, a strife-torn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment. I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over. And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the 'neutrinos being speedier than light particles' experiment that had made the headlines a few years ago.I can only imagine because he wasn't there to witness these watershed events and he isn't here to offer comment, criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer. His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work - a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universe(s). 
""Our familiar universe of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in the next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.""
It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the 13 chapters of 'Cosmos' and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time, the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet. I could write a review in the conventional format, leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you can.Or, instead, I could simply write about how, despite being more than 30 years outdated, Carl Sagan's voice of reason rings truer than ever, cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times. I could just tell you how Sagan's deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries, across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides, symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge.
""There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised.""
The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history, the Soviet Union is no more, America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President. But turmoil in the world order persists - the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region. The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past, if not more. Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits, blatant human rights violations, infringement on freedom of speech and expression, diplomatic arm-wrestling, the ever-enthusiastic decriers of science, 'War on Women', the shouts of the global-warming deniers reign supreme still. The players may have changed faces but the game of petty one-upmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabated.Which is why Sagan's rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being. His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances, of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority, impresses upon us a sense of urgency - that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers, the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced. As the concept of 'nuclear deterrence' receives a pat on the back, the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control, more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars, galaxies and universes. The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominy.Is it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria, the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes, Democritus, Aristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Christiaan Huygens, Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for? To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete self-annihilation?Sagan thinks not.
""Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for the Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""
 This is why I can't help but agree quite heartily with someone who says 'If I had a religion, I would be a Carl Saganian.'
""If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""
If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith, let it be this one."
32,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,5,"The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book. Gosh, I should not use the term ‘absolutely’ for something in which everything orbits around relativity.Anyway, I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book: my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars, …and expanding. My rating:What a brilliant read this has been. I have read it very slowly; one chapter a week. But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time? I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs. What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room, bringing home and explaining to me, the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable time.Sagan’s mind is truly cosmic, in scope and in outlook. We accompany him as he pulls together history, with the pre-Socratic, the Alexandrians, Leonardo, Kepler and Tycho Brahe, Huygens, Einstein, with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy. I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa, in a true Pasolini manner. I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his half-observed-half-fictional universe. I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft, realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early 1980s when Sagan’s program and book were all the rage, and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitous.I loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid, when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses. Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy. Unforgettable.The contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universe--the language of science--, which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions. But a running argument, and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program, is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies: superstition and violence.Produced during the Cold War, the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of self-destruction. His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projection.But the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being. But also how, in spite of my own insignificance, how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elements.Rather than depressing, I have found this thought heartening. A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lasts.Which means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium, invented by us. Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian Library.He understood."

But upon recently reading this book for the first time (which may seem a bit belated, but I am, after all, only 23) it instantly became one of my favorites, a status not easily attained by any book, and so I feel compelled to say something, to expound upon its many virtues and why it has endeared itself to me so completely.""One glance at [a book:] and you hear the voice of another person--perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time.""Perhaps prophetically, this is exactly the effect the late great Dr. Sagan acheived with this book. Through the power and fluid elegance of his prose, while reading Cosmos I could almost hear that familiar and somehow majestic voice (which in large part, I believe, made the PBS miniseries of the same name so wholly entrancing), as if the two of us were old friends having a leisurely, albeit profoundly intellectual, chat over coffee. Not exactly what one might expect from a book largely concerned with science, but this is just one of many qualities that makes it not only endearing to the reader, but also--and perhaps more importantly--accessible, making even the smattering of complex equations seem casual and undaunting.Aside from the beauty of its prose, which is at times poetic in its depth and its eloquence, Cosmos is also wholly engaging and fascinating in the depth and scope of its subects. Sagan succinctly and expertly covers everything from the birth of stars to the birth of science, the origins of life on Earth to the possibility of life on other planets, and our far distant and recent (in the grand cosmic scheme of things) past to the possibilities for our distant future. And yes, because science is constantly evolving and, as Dr. Sagan states, self-correcting, some of the information and theories covered may now be outdated, but I still believe that Cosmos is well worth reading. Not only can it serve as a friendly, accessible, and engrossing jumping-off point for we common folk who are interested in delving deeper into science but may feel a bit intimidated, it is also, if nothing else, worth reading for the beautifully poignant and evocative insights and the oft-philosophical tidbits contained therein.""We are the local embodiment of the Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars....""My only complaints about Cosmos are these: the last two or three chapters lag just a bit, incorporating several topics that seem extraneous and unnecessary, and somewhat lose the smooth, easy flow present throughout the rest of the book; and though I feel that, in the current world political climate, the section discussing nuclear arms is still as relevant today as then, I can't help but think that anybody above the age of 12 and possessing a fully-functioning cerebral cortex is already aware of the potential consequences of nuclear war (gamma burst, radiation poisoning, junk in the atmosphere, nuclear winter, death, doom, destruction, we get it already). However, I can concede on this last point that, at the time of publication, the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war was perhaps still a pretty hot topic. And in the grand scheme, these negative points make up only a negligible fraction of this otherwise fantastic book, and do not in anyway detract from its intrinsic value or from its overall enjoyability.All in all, Cosmos is a thoroughly enthralling read that takes you on a breath-taking journey from the inception of the Universe to futures that may never be, and allows us to ponder--when considering our own epic journey from starstuff to ""assemblages of a billion billion billion atoms contemplating the evolution of atoms""--what it truly means to be human and what our place, our purpose, is in the vast expanse of ""this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky""."

These flaws center on either Sagan's unusual speaking style and acting(?) abilities, or the show's contents. I certainly agree that he looks stupid when displaying the ""awed"" look; however, the complaints about the content of his shows are not justified. Yes, he is short on reasons and long on visual effects, and, yes, he talks as if the viewer did not know the obvious. What we are all forgetting is this: the average person doesn't know what we would consider ""obvious"". We should realize that Carl Sagan has his work cut out for him making science digestible for the average person."

Stars borrowed from skies that I witnessed when I was eight or maybe ten and would wake up early at pre-dawn, because that was the best time for star gazing after all. To read Mr.Sagan, the words so simple describing the Universe so complex. To read a small passage and follow it up with a sleep filled with dreams of all those stars dying and being born every passing moment.To recall, days of childish innocence gazing towards the infinite.Gazing in anticipation of recognizing a constellation or an anticipated meteor shower.To pause while reading and reflect, wonder. To attempt understanding things with closed eyes.To hear back from the infinite, after all these many years. Because thoughts might after all travel through vacuum.To think what has been thought centuries ago, but not by you yet.To take a possibility, and create countless possibilities.To be curious, to question. To look at things with not just your eyes. To be looked back from an infinite distance, with your own eyes.To the journeys we could take each night, only if we gave ourselves the chance to.To Pause.To realize that this moment ephemeral as it is, and only one among a multiple of possible moments,still IS."
37,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286151-z,5,"Let's put it simply. Cosmos is required reading for everyone who lives on this planet. It will give you a sense of perspective that nothing else can -- no lofty ideology, no omniscient religion, no inspiring quotations can explain things quite as clearly as Carl Sagan's treatise on science, reality, and the nature of things in this universe. Mind-bending and dazzling, and best of all, uncluttered by confusing scientific terminology. A book worthy of all the positive superlatives I can think of bestowing on it.We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilisations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densey populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.- Carl Sagan, Cosmos"
38,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,4,"Carl Sagan was a good writer. For a scientist, his prose had a literary style that is enjoyable to read, and he injected a sense of philosophy into his passionate account of the origins and marvels of the cosmos. I do find that the delivery was quite heavy-handed in trying to instill that sense of awe and wonder into the reader. What made it even more so was the narrator whose intonation carries a quality of breathless resonance. The arrangement of the subject matter also seemed a bit haphazard in my view. I couldn't help comparing this book to a favourite of mine - A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson which was organised, concise, informative, and very entertaining. Regardless, Cosmos is still a good primer to read for those who are interested in learning more about the universe and our world before venturing into more recent writings from the likes of Stephen Hawkings (may he rest in peace) and Neil deGrasse Tyson."
39,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"Re-visit 2016:1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean: After an introduction by Ann Druyan, including the benefits of the end of the Cold War, Carl Sagan opens the program with a description of the cosmos and a ""Spaceship of the Imagination"" (shaped like a dandelion seed). The ship journeys through the universes' hundred billion galaxies, the Local Group, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, the Orion Nebula, our Solar System, and finally the planet Earth. Eratosthenes' attempt to calculate the circumference of Earth leads to a description of the ancient Library of Alexandria. Finally, the ""Ages of Science"" are described, before pulling back to the full span of the Cosmic Calendar. 2: One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue : Sagan discusses the story of the Heike crab and artificial selection of crabs resembling samurai warriors, as an opening into a larger discussion of evolution through natural selection (and the pitfalls of the theory of intelligent design). Among the topics are the development of life on the Cosmic Calendar and the Cambrian explosion; the function of DNA in growth; genetic replication, repairs, and mutation; the common biochemistry of terrestrial organisms; the creation of the molecules of life in the Miller-Urey experiment; and speculation on alien life (such as life in Jupiter's clouds). In the Cosmos Update ten years later, Sagan remarks on RNA also controlling chemical reactions and reproducing itself and the different roles of comets (potentially carrying organic molecules or causing the Cretaceous--Tertiary extinction event)This episode is worth 6* just on its ownHeaven and Hell: Sagan discusses comets and asteroids as planetary impactors, giving recent examples of the Tunguska event and a lunar impact described by Canterbury monks in 1178. It moves to a description of the environment of Venus, from the previous fantastic theories of people such as Immanuel Velikovsky to the information gained by the Venera landers and its implications for Earth's greenhouse effect. The Cosmos Update highlights the connection to global warming. 1908 Siberia Tunguska5: Blues for a red planet: The episode, devoted to the planet Mars, begins with scientific and fictional speculation about the Red Planet during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Edgar Rice Burroughs' science fiction books, and Percival Lowell's false vision of canals on Mars). It then moves to Robert Goddard's early experiments in rocket-building, inspired by reading science fiction, and the work by Mars probes, including the Viking, searching for life on Mars. The episode ends with the possibility of the terraforming and colonization of Mars and a Cosmos Update on the relevance of Mars' environment to Earth's and the possibility of a manned mission to Mars.6: Traveller's Tales: The journeys of the Voyager probes is put in the context of the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, with a centuries-long tradition of sailing ship explorers, and its contemporary thinks (such as Constantijn Huygens and his son Christian). Their discoveries are compared to the Voyager probes' discoveries among the Jovian and Saturn systems. In Cosmos Update, image processing reconstructs Voyager's worlds and Voyager's last portrait of the Solar System as it leaves is shown.Definitely need an up-to-date version with all that has been discovered since this was published in 1980"
40,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"“ The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us - there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries. ”With these lines, we hop on Sagan’s ‘ship of imagination’ to visit distant worlds of Quasars, Pulsars, Black holes and Galaxies that are billions of light years away from us. A peak into the Cosmos. Sagan is a poet-scientist, he uses beautiful metaphors and aphorisms that are never too far from what an ordinary person can grasp. The style is lucid. The knowledge ranges from Mathematics to history, from ancient Greece to NASA. Building on the works of geniuses who introduced us to this fascinating, mind boggling universe of ours.After giving us a general idea of our ‘cosmic address’, Sagan moves on to Darwin and his discovery of Natural Selection as the engine of Evolution. This has to be one of the finest explanations of Darwinian Natural Selection, where Sagan uses the extra-ordinary example Heike crabs, to demonstrate the strange but beautiful ways in which ‘survival of the fittest’ is manifested. But he doesn’t keep us here for long. After giving the best possible ‘lecture’ on Evolution, he takes us further to see the harmony of the worlds. the planets and how the stars follow fixed patterns that can be mathematically explained; a most singular achievement of humans to have discovered the language of the Nature. Kepler gave us the laws of planetary motion. Laws that not just explained the elliptical orbit of Earth, but inspired a generation of mathematicians and physicists to inquire further into the nature and behaviour of the heavenly bodies.  A world so strange, complex and inaccessible has been made fascinating, understandable and rather accessible by the works of men and women who devoted their lives to Science and Cosmos. A world that is far more rich and awe-inspiring than the meagre and myth-ridden fairytales that we content ourselves with. We settle for too little. As the book progresses, Sagan’s obsession with extra-terrestrial life becomes more and more apparent. He admits that as a child, he spent hours contemplating about the possibility of intelligent life on other planets. Although our search for intelligent life has been a failure (even on Earth), Sagan aspires to make contact with the dwellers of distant worlds. The possibility of life elsewhere, is not too ‘fantastic’ altogether. As we observe the immensity of the observable universe, we can be more than certain that life does exist elsewhere but we don’t know what it will be like. Space travel and Alien Contact are not stuff of science fiction anymore but a possibility in waiting. The concluding chapters touch on two matters of colossal significance, namely Nuclear Weapons and Climate Change. These two man-made disasters are a ticking time bomb that can obliterate our species, and we have done precious little to stop them. We are destroying this planet, poisoning our oceans and destroying Specie after specie for centuries now. Man is without a doubt the most deadly predator in the history of Earth Life. And now we are on the path to self-annihilation. And this book is a wakeup call. A world ridden with ignorance and greed, will need to forego the idiotic bliss of being certain about everything. We don’t need good answers to everything, what we need instead are good questions. A good question is often times more educating than its answer. How can we love this world if we are awaiting an apocalypse, how can we love our environment and its safe keepers, the plants and the animals, without recognising that they are our distant cousins. Life, wherever it exists on this planet, is our kin. And we are bullying, butchering and asphyxiating it everywhere. What a shame !This is the kind of book that we must read and re-read. A book we must gift our children on their 12th birthdays. If you haven’t read it yet and you are over 12, do your self a favour and read it.Because Carl Sagan does more than just educate you about the wonders of Science and the Universe; he makes you fall in love with it."

43,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13631093-speranza,5,"As a child, I was fascinated and mesmerised by our world. It looked so huge, so full of wonders. Еverything was a source of marvel and inspiration. The world, the Earth, waited to be discovered and I had a long life ahead of me to do that. Then, in teenage years, I already knew all there was to know about life, people, the Earth and the Universe. Nobody could tell me any better. The new source of wonder had become love – falling in love, finding the purpose in another human being, the complete merging of body and soul.Once I entered the world of adults, I realised that I knew nothing. I strived for a higher purpose which, it turned out, was extremely hard to find in between a daily job that gives you no thrill, the same four walls you hide behind every night, and the usual faces that say the same words day in day out. The mundanity and routine that sustain a human life make it really hard to notice this same life. Wine and poetry help the cause to some extent, but they pull one out of Earth’s gravity for very short instances only.I have been at a crossroads lately, which shattered the illusive security of existence and made me anxious, itching with questions, sleepless, feeling an urge I couldn’t define. And then I started to seek answers, cosmic answers.Suddenly, it feels like a meteorite has hit my little planet. I read with eyes wide-open, with the naïveté of a toddler, with a remarkable ignorance and with an insatiable thirst to learn more. I feel like a child again! I feel in love again! I feel my senses being heightened and my pulse rushing. Carl Sagan made me feel like a scientist. For I have made a wonderful discovery - the nutrient of my little earthly life is curiosity – no step for the Cosmos, one giant leap for the cosmic speck of dust that I am.I could talk for hours about how beautiful and captivating I found Cosmos to be. It made me crave knowledge of the unknown. It made my underdeveloped imagination burst with colourful visions. It made my stunted mind race. I savoured every word, embraced every idea. I guess for someone who has read a lot on the subject I look like a newly hatched chicken, struggling to make its first steps. I have been intimidated by physics and chemistry all my life and now it is time to catch up.My gut tells me that Sagan is not right in completely rejecting astrology, the occult or religion, but I choose to trust him because he has managed to put into simple words concepts that have scared away so many people for so long. His narrative voice is the perfect combination of a bright mind and humility. It is subtle and guiding, not patronizing. It is human and it is humane – it makes you believe you can understand and dream beyond the boundaries of your own mind.Sagan was a great scientist, but I think his greatest achievement is that he made science accessible and interesting to his fellow human beings. His venture to bring the Cosmos closer to humans might eventually pay off in helping bring humans closer to the Cosmos. There is so much more I want to say, but I don’t have words for all thoughts that Cosmos provoked in me. I feel ashamed that my review of this monumental work revolves around my little nichtigkeit, but, after all, even the biggest galaxies are made of the smallest particles."
44,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,5,"A gorgeous book in every possible way. From the lush illustration and clever diagrams clear through to Sagan's lyrical and at times whimsical narrative, this is the science book for non-scientists. (And if you are a scientist, may this be a lesson in how to tell your story.) Sagan makes the astronomy and the math and the mind-boggling complexity of the universe not only comprehensible but palatable. He wraps up our history as a species into the history of the universe (such that we can even know it).As a kid, I adored this book for the color plates. I would flip the pages in my Dad's copy over and over and over again. Down on the floor, on the couch -- anywhere. Probably every day from ages four through seventeen. I didn't go on to be an astronomer. Hell, I never took a physics class and I nearly failed more than one math class (as I recall) but this book...Reading it cover-to-cover for the first time as an adult, I was struck by many things. The book is dense but Sagan paces it well, makes you hungry for every anecdote about Kepler or Pythagoras, thirsty for the decimal-laden scientific notation.And then there was the moment that blew my mind; tucked away in a footnote about telescopic ""snapshots"" of galaxies:...The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small.!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
45,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70913-deb,1,"This book was my bible when I was an enemy of God. As a stubbornly devout atheist, this was the book I turned to for justification of my proud and arrogant rejection of my Creator. Instead of reading this pile of conjecture, I recommend reading the Holy Bible (then get on your knees and repent before the holy God who gave you life and sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for your lawlessness and sin). :-)"
46,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Sagan explores the history and future of cosmology with wonder and foreboding in this slightly dated but insightful and still highly relevant mix of science and philosophy. He begins with the story of Eratosthenes, the first to calculate the circumference of the earth in the third century BCE. His instruments were two sticks. He placed one vertically in the ground at the summer solstice on the equator and a second 800 kilometers north. At noon the first would give no shadow but the angle of the shadow of the second would correspond to that segment of the earth. Divide the angle (7 degrees) into 360, multiply it by 800 and you are pretty close to the actual circumference. Simple but brilliant!In the 6th century BCE Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras began laying the foundations of modern scientific thought from astronomy to mathematics to biology. The 6th century not only produced these brilliant Ionian Greeks, but Gautama Buddha in India, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Zoroaster in Persia, and Pharaoh Necho in Egypt who had Africa circumnavigated 2000 years before the Portuguese. Sagan questions whether this simultaneous explosion of new ideas could really be unrelated, but doesn’t suggest an answer. Unfortunately this burst of innovative thought wouldn’t last. Sagan points to the destruction of the library at Alexandria in the fourth century CE as a final blow to learning symbolizing the beginning of the Dark Ages. It would be another 1,000 years for this ancient knowledge to be rediscovered although much would be lost forever. Sagan suggests the rise of slavery led to the demise of the Ionian scientists. Slavery obviated the need for technology and set up the need for clear lines of demarcation of class to justify it. Thus working with the hands, engaging in ungentlemanly activity was wrong. Religion was employed to rationalize the institution. Today we are familiar with a more recent example, the antebellum South which failed to industrialize due to its reliance on slavery and ended up falling far behind the North.Sagan covers the 16th and 17th century contributions of Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, and Newton. Then he skips to the 1970’s discussing the Voyager missions, exploration of the solar system and the prospects for finding life. He presents the then current ideas on the nature of the universe discussing stars, space, time and the exploration of the galaxy. Sagan is particularly focused on the use of radio astronomy not only to identify far flung civilizations but to contact them. Cosmos was written before string theory, the multiverse, supersymmetry, dark matter, dark energy and the Higgs boson became hot topics. Still his discussion holds up well. Sagan is enamored with interacting with other civilizations. I am not sure this is a good idea but danger from aliens seems far less likely than danger from our fellow man. In trying to calculate the number of advanced civilizations in the universe, a key factor is how long a civilization can last before it destroys itself. We have only very recently gotten to the point where we can reach out to other worlds and between climate change, nuclear war, and other self-destructive behavior our future is clearly tenuous. Sagan takes this worry very seriously and persuades me to as well. Perhaps our search for intelligent life on other worlds has borne no fruit because intelligent life is a misnomer. "

The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we've learned most of what we know. Recently, we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from.We long to returnand we can .because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of starstuff 
i don't think i'll ever give 5 stars more wholeheartedly as i am doing now ..5 shimmering , eye-blindingly shinning stars , the brightest suns GR has in its this little galaxy should be owned by this book , cosmos .its really shocking that only days ago i didnt know who carl sagan is . The name may have seemed a bit familiar , but nothing more Now , this name feels too meaningful , i'd remember this man's words , his deep voice discussing the formations of the stars and their decay and deaths , i'd surly remember the passion in his eyes in the parallel Cosmos TV show , the way he pronounces Billions and Billions stressing on the B or the way he says  ""we are made of starstuff"" with too much longing . I LOVED THIS BOOK  it maybe mainstream and often said but i dont know how to phrase what i feel about it any other way , seems its beyond my ability of putting things into coherent sentences .it was Beautiful  in every mean , i wish now that i have saved every beautiful i've ever used , ever said , so that when i call this peace of heaven beautiful you would get what i am saying ..quoting from the same book , cosmos is :
""visually and musically stunning, and to engage the heart as well as the mind""
Carl Sagan , an astronomer, a cosmologist and a writer. a brilliant man . the way he uses words , it doesnt feel decorated , these words are written too honestly , the passions and ambitions of a man ,once a child inlove with science-fiction as we all are , scriped in papers .I feel too ashamed that i am 22 years living in this world and its only now that i read this book , Cosmos wasn't only about astronomy , but philosophy , biology and a big deal of history all written very beautifully you will enjoy every bit , i started to love radio waves , Phythagorean laws and things of this sort that i may have considered dry and lifeless in my school years . its hard to believe that this is written in the eighties of the last century , may be so much had changed , maybe some stuff here and there are not up to date but its is still a big source of inspiration . The question about extraterrestial life remains a puzzle , but exploring the problem is a fascinating journey in itself .I am not an expert on natural science , a mere starter , but it was easy for me to read , so i think carl sagan's books are gems of some sort , they are the bridge between scientists and common people , they are written for us , we who love the stars and crave to understand them yet we are no scientists or experts our selves . and generally expertise in the subject matter is not required to enjoy it , as the love of it shall demonstrates. I am officaily recommending this book for every human being , its a thing every soul should read .i wish i can buy enough copies for the human race and shove them down their doors .

I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky*We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever*Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations*The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion* (1033, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called compelling. Worlds are precious*Each star system is an island in space, quarantined from its neighbors by the light- years. I can imagine creatures evolving into glimmerings of knowledge on innumerable worlds, every one of them assuming at first their puny planet and paltry few suns to be all that is. We grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves the Cosmos*Welcome to the planet Earth - a place of blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water, cool forests and soft meadows, a world positively rippling with life. In the cosmic perspective it is, as I have said, poignantly beautiful and rare; but it is also, for the moment, unique*The study of the heavens brought Ptolemy a kind of ecstasy. ‘ Mortal as I am,’ he wrote, ‘ I know that I am born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth. . *With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist . . . I yield freely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the book - to be read either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness*With searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and everything suffused in an eerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the goddess of love than the incarnation of hell*All that matters is the evidence, and the evidence is not yet in.*The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished*there are regularities in Nature that permit its secrets to be uncovered. Nature is not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered and admirable character of the universe was called Cosmos*Traveling close to the speed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down close to the speed of light, special relativity provides us with a means of going to the stars*A star is a phoenix, destined to rise for a time from its own ashes*Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival*Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species*The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons. The radio and radar techniques employed to track and guide ballistic missiles and defend against attack are also used to monitor and command the spacecraft on the planets and to listen for signals from civilizations near other stars. If we use these technologies to destroy ourselves, we surely will venture no more to the planets and the stars. But the converse is also true. If we continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will be shaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will recognize that our explorations can be carried out only on behalf of all the people of the planet Earth"

Both of the before mentioned apply to me, but why do I say it has a special meaning? Well, as simple as it may sound, this book was what took me to where I am right now. There has always been magic for me. As a kid, I always believed in everything everyone else seemed to despise and so it was my faith that my parents even got to think that I was crazy.First, there were these magical creatures: faeries, mermaids, goblins, wizards, etc. Then something even better and more magical came to my life: science. Now you may be thinking, okay, but science is a wide subject, what part of science? And I will answer you: why do I have to choose from it when I can learn from all of it? That’s something taught me. Science is connected to everything in ways that some of us have never imagined. If we talk about science, we must think of it as the most important discovery in the history of humanity, of art, religion, music, and beauty in its fullest expression. One can’t live without the other, they are the things that give form and purpose to our existence. Since I find myself unfit to give a decent critic to the book (not because I lack knowledge but for the role, it played and keeps playing in my life), I’m going to invite you to think a little bit.Imagine yourself as a 6-year old kid. You are in the countryside, separated from any sound or human contact, and the only light is the one that comes from the starts you are currently watching. You feel happy about your loneliness. You don’t know anything about the matter and yet you have a feeling that there’s some magic in the sky, some kind of spell written in it. Suddenly the stars are passing by, leaving a blur of light on their tray and you wonder how some stars can move and fall while others keep doing their job, brightening everything around you. You run to the house at the other side of the camp, and turn to see the stars again, they are still there, the same stars every day, you are scared because you don’t understand and that makes you feel uneasy. You go to sleep. Next morning you wake up and go directly to the nearest library, you ask for books of stars, but the librarian tells you she has none and instead she gives you a physics, religion and art books, what a disappointment you think. You see the pictures and read as much as you can, it isn’t an easy task, though, you have barely learned to read. The hours passed by, and by the end of the day, you realized how much you have learned, not only about physics and stars but also about religion, math, and arts. It’s then when you as a 6-years old kid find the most valuable treasure when you were only looking to understand the stars. As I said before, there is no way of reviewing this book correctly."

It doesn't matter that it was written 25+ years ago, pre-Hubble telescope, before the fall of the USSR, etc. - Sagan's insight and wide-reaching scope are timeless.The last few chapters are so rich in thought-provoking information they are worth re-reading. Sagan would have never wanted his work to become the foundation of a religion, but I can see why so many people refer to this as their ""bible"" and use it to help make sense out of a mad world and one's short time to inhabit it."

This is one of the best popular scientific books that I have read. This book is well written, reads like a mystery novel and is a great source of interesting information. Scientific information is explained in ""simple reader"" language.The focus in this book is on astronomy : how big is our universe, how old it is, how it ""works"", etc. Sagan pays a lot of attention to stars and galaxies, but also presents the more advanced topics of black holes and pulsars. There are also occasional earthly detours - evolution of life on earth, ancient greeks, the library of Alexandria, voyages of explorers, etc. The book also tries to bring up some philosophical questions, especially in relation to the possibility of other civilizations in the cosmos, and how a contact between us and them would happen.Highly recommendation!===================

This book is really very impressive. A story of 15 billion years of the cosmos compressed in this relatively smaller book! Easy to read and understand, Carl Sagan's Cosmos draws the reader into a world so vivid and realistic that it's hard not to be mesmerized throughout while reading this book."
54,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3," I wish I had LOVED this book as Carl Sagan is an icon. It was entertaining, if you ignore the fact that it is VERY dated (I mean, 40+ years dated), which is not its fault. However, I much prefer A Short History of Nearly Everything for a review of the same information. "
55,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Cosmos operates at a massive scale worthy of its lofty title. Carl Sagan, in a companion compendium to his 13-part 1980 TV series of the same name, explains what we know about the universe and the progression of human thought about origins and the nature of reality. We zoom across frames of reference, from the actions of atoms and subatomic particles, to the molecules that store genetic information, to life on this planet, and beyond, to the structure of the universe. We learn about the various explorations of Mars, Venus, Io and Europa, and how we might travel to stars in the future. Along the way, Sagan explains not just what we know, but how we know it, and the fascinating stories of how that information was discovered: often by brilliance or persistence, and sometimes by historical accident or sheer luck. His enthusiasm is readily apparent: infectious and infused with a positive vision for the world and the future. One can only wish that more people on Earth shared Sagan's perspective.The book is punctuated with quotes from various myths of the universe's origins, which serve to remind us how important these questions have always been, but also how poorly equipped we are to access answers through intuition alone. It is the scientific method that has allowed us to cumulatively add new knowledge. He quotes Seneca, from the first century CE: ""There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate... Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all."" Seneca saw clearly, and Sagan shares the stories of thinkers like Pythagoras, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Huygens, Newton and Einstein and the various contributions they made to our modern understanding.I listened to the audio version, read by LeVar Burton, which is fantastic. I then picked up my physical copy to re-read the quotes and footnotes and see the included charts and illustrations. I highly recommend this for everyone... even if you have a strong understanding of science, it is worth it just to hear Sagan's brilliant and beautifully crafted explanations."
56,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36595208-n-rmin,5,"It took me long to read it, but it was worth it. First thing that captivates me that despite being a nonfiction scientific book, Carl Sagan described the whole universe, explained the science in such a poetic and eloquent way that you would think he is a romantic poet! And the parts about his childhood and his enthusiasm for astronomy, for cosmos were the cutest and beautiful thing I have ever read. I saw myself, my passion for space in him, in his writings. And best part of this book was the incredible ideas that can belong to a sci-fi writer! I even took notes from this ideas so maybe I can use them in my future writings. Carl Sagan became my favorite person in science))) And this book will be forever my favorite and I am sure I will read it again and again and also recommend it as a teacher)) And these are my favorite quotes:“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” “What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“we make our world significant by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers”"

58,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"When do we truly die ? The most logical answer would be to say that we die when the last breath escapes us and when our body and mind cease to function. But I tend to differ , death would be the loss of fascination and wonderment at the world around us. To wake up and see the sun rise everyday, to listen to birdsong in the mornings and see the blue sky above you, to feel the rain lashing at you and at times caressing you with its softness, the gentle breeze of the evenings, the feel of the sea waves beneath your toes....this is life ! And when a time arrives during which none of this can be felt with the same sense of wanton bliss, I shall call it death. If ever there arises a world like Cormac McCarthy's The Road envisaged, I would go insane in a couple of days at the most ! This digression is very much in line with Carl Sagan's work for he speaks to us about our home : Earth. His voice is one of clear reason and indefatigable energy that I was filled with a sense of elation to say the least. You hold his hand and walk with him, a kid who for the first time stepped into a science class with eyes as wide and big as glass marbles ! Even when he tells you that you are nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in the order of things in the galaxy, he continues to say  But look around you, isn't the Earth the most beautiful thing you ever saw ?  Sagan conducts a virtual tour through the history of human civilizations, astronomy, the rise of science, interstellar and interplanetary travel and also ponders for a chapter on the perceived nature of extra terrestrial intelligence. What makes it marvelous reading ? One word : Simplicity ! He never writes a word that a common man needs to break his head over. Yes, there are graphical representations and equations galore in the book but even if you skip them and keep reading you will not be at a loss. Things are kept to the simplest way possible, a spade is called a spade and there are no unnecessary theatrics. I have not seen the TV series that inspired this book but am surely going to go in search of it ! Recommended for those with a love for nature and science."
59,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45702383-a-l-buehrer,2," Let me just say this, I love science as much as anybody else, but I can love it without getting weird about it.  I guess I was expecting this book to be something it wasn't. It's really just a humanist philosophy book. I was expecting to learn something. I read science books to stretch my mind, not to be preached at. This was the preachiest science book I have ever read. Carl Sagan obviously literally worships science. This book was really just a hymn to science, not really delving into any particular part of it enough to really be interesting. I was disappointed enough in Sagan's writing to seriously consider taking ""The Pale Blue Dot"" off my reading list. His tone is so condescending. I decided to read it anyway. Just to give him a second chance. I'm just saying, he's not making my favorite authors list by any means. "

61,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,5,"I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of 9/11 and the world in the new millennium, a strife-torn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment. I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over. And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the 'neutrinos being speedier than light particles' experiment that had made the headlines a few years ago.I can only imagine because he wasn't there to witness these watershed events and he isn't here to offer comment, criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer. His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work - a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universe(s). 
""Our familiar universe of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in the next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.""
It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the 13 chapters of 'Cosmos' and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time, the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet. I could write a review in the conventional format, leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you can.Or, instead, I could simply write about how, despite being more than 30 years outdated, Carl Sagan's voice of reason rings truer than ever, cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times. I could just tell you how Sagan's deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries, across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides, symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge.
""There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised.""
The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history, the Soviet Union is no more, America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President. But turmoil in the world order persists - the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region. The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past, if not more. Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits, blatant human rights violations, infringement on freedom of speech and expression, diplomatic arm-wrestling, the ever-enthusiastic decriers of science, 'War on Women', the shouts of the global-warming deniers reign supreme still. The players may have changed faces but the game of petty one-upmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabated.Which is why Sagan's rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being. His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances, of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority, impresses upon us a sense of urgency - that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers, the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced. As the concept of 'nuclear deterrence' receives a pat on the back, the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control, more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars, galaxies and universes. The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominy.Is it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria, the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes, Democritus, Aristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Christiaan Huygens, Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for? To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete self-annihilation?Sagan thinks not.
""Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for the Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""
 This is why I can't help but agree quite heartily with someone who says 'If I had a religion, I would be a Carl Saganian.'
""If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""
If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith, let it be this one."
62,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,5,"The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book. Gosh, I should not use the term ‘absolutely’ for something in which everything orbits around relativity.Anyway, I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book: my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars, …and expanding. My rating:What a brilliant read this has been. I have read it very slowly; one chapter a week. But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time? I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs. What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room, bringing home and explaining to me, the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable time.Sagan’s mind is truly cosmic, in scope and in outlook. We accompany him as he pulls together history, with the pre-Socratic, the Alexandrians, Leonardo, Kepler and Tycho Brahe, Huygens, Einstein, with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy. I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa, in a true Pasolini manner. I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his half-observed-half-fictional universe. I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft, realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early 1980s when Sagan’s program and book were all the rage, and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitous.I loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid, when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses. Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy. Unforgettable.The contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universe--the language of science--, which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions. But a running argument, and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program, is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies: superstition and violence.Produced during the Cold War, the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of self-destruction. His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projection.But the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being. But also how, in spite of my own insignificance, how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elements.Rather than depressing, I have found this thought heartening. A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lasts.Which means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium, invented by us. Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian Library.He understood."

64,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397575-daniella,5,"I'm not sure what I could possibly say about Cosmos that hasn't already been said by countless others in the 28 years since its publication, and likely in a far more intelligent and eloquent way than I ever could. But upon recently reading this book for the first time (which may seem a bit belated, but I am, after all, only 23) it instantly became one of my favorites, a status not easily attained by any book, and so I feel compelled to say something, to expound upon its many virtues and why it has endeared itself to me so completely.""One glance at [a book:] and you hear the voice of another person--perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time.""Perhaps prophetically, this is exactly the effect the late great Dr. Sagan acheived with this book. Through the power and fluid elegance of his prose, while reading Cosmos I could almost hear that familiar and somehow majestic voice (which in large part, I believe, made the PBS miniseries of the same name so wholly entrancing), as if the two of us were old friends having a leisurely, albeit profoundly intellectual, chat over coffee. Not exactly what one might expect from a book largely concerned with science, but this is just one of many qualities that makes it not only endearing to the reader, but also--and perhaps more importantly--accessible, making even the smattering of complex equations seem casual and undaunting.Aside from the beauty of its prose, which is at times poetic in its depth and its eloquence, Cosmos is also wholly engaging and fascinating in the depth and scope of its subects. Sagan succinctly and expertly covers everything from the birth of stars to the birth of science, the origins of life on Earth to the possibility of life on other planets, and our far distant and recent (in the grand cosmic scheme of things) past to the possibilities for our distant future. And yes, because science is constantly evolving and, as Dr. Sagan states, self-correcting, some of the information and theories covered may now be outdated, but I still believe that Cosmos is well worth reading. Not only can it serve as a friendly, accessible, and engrossing jumping-off point for we common folk who are interested in delving deeper into science but may feel a bit intimidated, it is also, if nothing else, worth reading for the beautifully poignant and evocative insights and the oft-philosophical tidbits contained therein.""We are the local embodiment of the Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars....""My only complaints about Cosmos are these: the last two or three chapters lag just a bit, incorporating several topics that seem extraneous and unnecessary, and somewhat lose the smooth, easy flow present throughout the rest of the book; and though I feel that, in the current world political climate, the section discussing nuclear arms is still as relevant today as then, I can't help but think that anybody above the age of 12 and possessing a fully-functioning cerebral cortex is already aware of the potential consequences of nuclear war (gamma burst, radiation poisoning, junk in the atmosphere, nuclear winter, death, doom, destruction, we get it already). However, I can concede on this last point that, at the time of publication, the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war was perhaps still a pretty hot topic. And in the grand scheme, these negative points make up only a negligible fraction of this otherwise fantastic book, and do not in anyway detract from its intrinsic value or from its overall enjoyability.All in all, Cosmos is a thoroughly enthralling read that takes you on a breath-taking journey from the inception of the Universe to futures that may never be, and allows us to ponder--when considering our own epic journey from starstuff to ""assemblages of a billion billion billion atoms contemplating the evolution of atoms""--what it truly means to be human and what our place, our purpose, is in the vast expanse of ""this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky""."

These flaws center on either Sagan's unusual speaking style and acting(?) abilities, or the show's contents. I certainly agree that he looks stupid when displaying the ""awed"" look; however, the complaints about the content of his shows are not justified. Yes, he is short on reasons and long on visual effects, and, yes, he talks as if the viewer did not know the obvious. What we are all forgetting is this: the average person doesn't know what we would consider ""obvious"". We should realize that Carl Sagan has his work cut out for him making science digestible for the average person."

Stars borrowed from skies that I witnessed when I was eight or maybe ten and would wake up early at pre-dawn, because that was the best time for star gazing after all. To read Mr.Sagan, the words so simple describing the Universe so complex. To read a small passage and follow it up with a sleep filled with dreams of all those stars dying and being born every passing moment.To recall, days of childish innocence gazing towards the infinite.Gazing in anticipation of recognizing a constellation or an anticipated meteor shower.To pause while reading and reflect, wonder. To attempt understanding things with closed eyes.To hear back from the infinite, after all these many years. Because thoughts might after all travel through vacuum.To think what has been thought centuries ago, but not by you yet.To take a possibility, and create countless possibilities.To be curious, to question. To look at things with not just your eyes.

67,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286151-z,5,"Let's put it simply. Cosmos is required reading for everyone who lives on this planet. It will give you a sense of perspective that nothing else can -- no lofty ideology, no omniscient religion, no inspiring quotations can explain things quite as clearly as Carl Sagan's treatise on science, reality, and the nature of things in this universe. Mind-bending and dazzling, and best of all, uncluttered by confusing scientific terminology. A book worthy of all the positive superlatives I can think of bestowing on it.We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilisations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densey populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.- Carl Sagan, Cosmos"
68,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,4,"Carl Sagan was a good writer. For a scientist, his prose had a literary style that is enjoyable to read, and he injected a sense of philosophy into his passionate account of the origins and marvels of the cosmos. I do find that the delivery was quite heavy-handed in trying to instill that sense of awe and wonder into the reader. What made it even more so was the narrator whose intonation carries a quality of breathless resonance. The arrangement of the subject matter also seemed a bit haphazard in my view. I couldn't help comparing this book to a favourite of mine - A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson which was organised, concise, informative, and very entertaining. Regardless, Cosmos is still a good primer to read for those who are interested in learning more about the universe and our world before venturing into more recent writings from the likes of Stephen Hawkings (may he rest in peace) and Neil deGrasse Tyson."

The ship journeys through the universes' hundred billion galaxies, the Local Group, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, the Orion Nebula, our Solar System, and finally the planet Earth. Eratosthenes' attempt to calculate the circumference of Earth leads to a description of the ancient Library of Alexandria. Finally, the ""Ages of Science"" are described, before pulling back to the full span of the Cosmic Calendar. 2: One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue : Sagan discusses the story of the Heike crab and artificial selection of crabs resembling samurai warriors, as an opening into a larger discussion of evolution through natural selection (and the pitfalls of the theory of intelligent design). Among the topics are the development of life on the Cosmic Calendar and the Cambrian explosion; the function of DNA in growth; genetic replication, repairs, and mutation; the common biochemistry of terrestrial organisms; the creation of the molecules of life in the Miller-Urey experiment; and speculation on alien life (such as life in Jupiter's clouds). In the Cosmos Update ten years later, Sagan remarks on RNA also controlling chemical reactions and reproducing itself and the different roles of comets (potentially carrying organic molecules or causing the Cretaceous--Tertiary extinction event)This episode is worth 6* just on its ownHeaven and Hell: Sagan discusses comets and asteroids as planetary impactors, giving recent examples of the Tunguska event and a lunar impact described by Canterbury monks in 1178. It moves to a description of the environment of Venus, from the previous fantastic theories of people such as Immanuel Velikovsky to the information gained by the Venera landers and its implications for Earth's greenhouse effect. The Cosmos Update highlights the connection to global warming. 1908 Siberia Tunguska5: Blues for a red planet: The episode, devoted to the planet Mars, begins with scientific and fictional speculation about the Red Planet during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Edgar Rice Burroughs' science fiction books, and Percival Lowell's false vision of canals on Mars). It then moves to Robert Goddard's early experiments in rocket-building, inspired by reading science fiction, and the work by Mars probes, including the Viking, searching for life on Mars. The episode ends with the possibility of the terraforming and colonization of Mars and a Cosmos Update on the relevance of Mars' environment to Earth's and the possibility of a manned mission to Mars.6: Traveller's Tales: The journeys of the Voyager probes is put in the context of the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, with a centuries-long tradition of sailing ship explorers, and its contemporary thinks (such as Constantijn Huygens and his son Christian). Their discoveries are compared to the Voyager probes' discoveries among the Jovian and Saturn systems. In Cosmos Update, image processing reconstructs Voyager's worlds and Voyager's last portrait of the Solar System as it leaves is shown.Definitely need an up-to-date version with all that has been discovered since this was published in 1980"

Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us - there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries. ”With these lines, we hop on Sagan’s ‘ship of imagination’ to visit distant worlds of Quasars, Pulsars, Black holes and Galaxies that are billions of light years away from us. A peak into the Cosmos. Sagan is a poet-scientist, he uses beautiful metaphors and aphorisms that are never too far from what an ordinary person can grasp. The style is lucid. The knowledge ranges from Mathematics to history, from ancient Greece to NASA. Building on the works of geniuses who introduced us to this fascinating, mind boggling universe of ours.After giving us a general idea of our ‘cosmic address’, Sagan moves on to Darwin and his discovery of Natural Selection as the engine of Evolution. This has to be one of the finest explanations of Darwinian Natural Selection, where Sagan uses the extra-ordinary example Heike crabs, to demonstrate the strange but beautiful ways in which ‘survival of the fittest’ is manifested. But he doesn’t keep us here for long. After giving the best possible ‘lecture’ on Evolution, he takes us further to see the harmony of the worlds. the planets and how the stars follow fixed patterns that can be mathematically explained; a most singular achievement of humans to have discovered the language of the Nature. Kepler gave us the laws of planetary motion. Laws that not just explained the elliptical orbit of Earth, but inspired a generation of mathematicians and physicists to inquire further into the nature and behaviour of the heavenly bodies.  A world so strange, complex and inaccessible has been made fascinating, understandable and rather accessible by the works of men and women who devoted their lives to Science and Cosmos. A world that is far more rich and awe-inspiring than the meagre and myth-ridden fairytales that we content ourselves with. We settle for too little. As the book progresses, Sagan’s obsession with extra-terrestrial life becomes more and more apparent. He admits that as a child, he spent hours contemplating about the possibility of intelligent life on other planets. Although our search for intelligent life has been a failure (even on Earth), Sagan aspires to make contact with the dwellers of distant worlds. The possibility of life elsewhere, is not too ‘fantastic’ altogether. As we observe the immensity of the observable universe, we can be more than certain that life does exist elsewhere but we don’t know what it will be like. Space travel and Alien Contact are not stuff of science fiction anymore but a possibility in waiting. The concluding chapters touch on two matters of colossal significance, namely Nuclear Weapons and Climate Change. These two man-made disasters are a ticking time bomb that can obliterate our species, and we have done precious little to stop them. We are destroying this planet, poisoning our oceans and destroying Specie after specie for centuries now. Man is without a doubt the most deadly predator in the history of Earth Life. And now we are on the path to self-annihilation. And this book is a wakeup call. A world ridden with ignorance and greed, will need to forego the idiotic bliss of being certain about everything. We don’t need good answers to everything, what we need instead are good questions. A good question is often times more educating than its answer. How can we love this world if we are awaiting an apocalypse, how can we love our environment and its safe keepers, the plants and the animals, without recognising that they are our distant cousins. Life, wherever it exists on this planet, is our kin. And we are bullying, butchering and asphyxiating it everywhere. What a shame !This is the kind of book that we must read and re-read. A book we must gift our children on their 12th birthdays. If you haven’t read it yet and you are over 12, do your self a favour and read it.Because Carl Sagan does more than just educate you about the wonders of Science and the Universe; he makes you fall in love with it."

73,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13631093-speranza,5,"As a child, I was fascinated and mesmerised by our world. It looked so huge, so full of wonders. Еverything was a source of marvel and inspiration. The world, the Earth, waited to be discovered and I had a long life ahead of me to do that. Then, in teenage years, I already knew all there was to know about life, people, the Earth and the Universe. Nobody could tell me any better. The new source of wonder had become love – falling in love, finding the purpose in another human being, the complete merging of body and soul.Once I entered the world of adults, I realised that I knew nothing. I strived for a higher purpose which, it turned out, was extremely hard to find in between a daily job that gives you no thrill, the same four walls you hide behind every night, and the usual faces that say the same words day in day out. The mundanity and routine that sustain a human life make it really hard to notice this same life. Wine and poetry help the cause to some extent, but they pull one out of Earth’s gravity for very short instances only.I have been at a crossroads lately, which shattered the illusive security of existence and made me anxious, itching with questions, sleepless, feeling an urge I couldn’t define. And then I started to seek answers, cosmic answers.Suddenly, it feels like a meteorite has hit my little planet. I read with eyes wide-open, with the naïveté of a toddler, with a remarkable ignorance and with an insatiable thirst to learn more. I feel like a child again! I feel in love again! I feel my senses being heightened and my pulse rushing. Carl Sagan made me feel like a scientist. For I have made a wonderful discovery - the nutrient of my little earthly life is curiosity – no step for the Cosmos, one giant leap for the cosmic speck of dust that I am.I could talk for hours about how beautiful and captivating I found Cosmos to be. It made me crave knowledge of the unknown. It made my underdeveloped imagination burst with colourful visions. It made my stunted mind race. I savoured every word, embraced every idea. I guess for someone who has read a lot on the subject I look like a newly hatched chicken, struggling to make its first steps. I have been intimidated by physics and chemistry all my life and now it is time to catch up.My gut tells me that Sagan is not right in completely rejecting astrology, the occult or religion, but I choose to trust him because he has managed to put into simple words concepts that have scared away so many people for so long. His narrative voice is the perfect combination of a bright mind and humility. It is subtle and guiding, not patronizing. It is human and it is humane – it makes you believe you can understand and dream beyond the boundaries of your own mind.Sagan was a great scientist, but I think his greatest achievement is that he made science accessible and interesting to his fellow human beings. His venture to bring the Cosmos closer to humans might eventually pay off in helping bring humans closer to the Cosmos. There is so much more I want to say, but I don’t have words for all thoughts that Cosmos provoked in me. I feel ashamed that my review of this monumental work revolves around my little nichtigkeit, but, after all, even the biggest galaxies are made of the smallest particles."
74,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,5,"A gorgeous book in every possible way. From the lush illustration and clever diagrams clear through to Sagan's lyrical and at times whimsical narrative, this is the science book for non-scientists. (And if you are a scientist, may this be a lesson in how to tell your story.) Sagan makes the astronomy and the math and the mind-boggling complexity of the universe not only comprehensible but palatable. He wraps up our history as a species into the history of the universe (such that we can even know it).As a kid, I adored this book for the color plates. I would flip the pages in my Dad's copy over and over and over again. Down on the floor, on the couch -- anywhere. Probably every day from ages four through seventeen. I didn't go on to be an astronomer. Hell, I never took a physics class and I nearly failed more than one math class (as I recall) but this book...Reading it cover-to-cover for the first time as an adult, I was struck by many things. The book is dense but Sagan paces it well, makes you hungry for every anecdote about Kepler or Pythagoras, thirsty for the decimal-laden scientific notation.And then there was the moment that blew my mind; tucked away in a footnote about telescopic ""snapshots"" of galaxies:...The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small.!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
75,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70913-deb,1,"This book was my bible when I was an enemy of God. As a stubbornly devout atheist, this was the book I turned to for justification of my proud and arrogant rejection of my Creator. Instead of reading this pile of conjecture, I recommend reading the Holy Bible (then get on your knees and repent before the holy God who gave you life and sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for your lawlessness and sin). :-)"
76,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Sagan explores the history and future of cosmology with wonder and foreboding in this slightly dated but insightful and still highly relevant mix of science and philosophy. He begins with the story of Eratosthenes, the first to calculate the circumference of the earth in the third century BCE. His instruments were two sticks. He placed one vertically in the ground at the summer solstice on the equator and a second 800 kilometers north. At noon the first would give no shadow but the angle of the shadow of the second would correspond to that segment of the earth. Divide the angle (7 degrees) into 360, multiply it by 800 and you are pretty close to the actual circumference. Simple but brilliant!In the 6th century BCE Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras began laying the foundations of modern scientific thought from astronomy to mathematics to biology. The 6th century not only produced these brilliant Ionian Greeks, but Gautama Buddha in India, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Zoroaster in Persia, and Pharaoh Necho in Egypt who had Africa circumnavigated 2000 years before the Portuguese. Sagan questions whether this simultaneous explosion of new ideas could really be unrelated, but doesn’t suggest an answer. Unfortunately this burst of innovative thought wouldn’t last. Sagan points to the destruction of the library at Alexandria in the fourth century CE as a final blow to learning symbolizing the beginning of the Dark Ages. It would be another 1,000 years for this ancient knowledge to be rediscovered although much would be lost forever. Sagan suggests the rise of slavery led to the demise of the Ionian scientists. Slavery obviated the need for technology and set up the need for clear lines of demarcation of class to justify it. Thus working with the hands, engaging in ungentlemanly activity was wrong. Religion was employed to rationalize the institution. Today we are familiar with a more recent example, the antebellum South which failed to industrialize due to its reliance on slavery and ended up falling far behind the North.Sagan covers the 16th and 17th century contributions of Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, and Newton. Then he skips to the 1970’s discussing the Voyager missions, exploration of the solar system and the prospects for finding life. He presents the then current ideas on the nature of the universe discussing stars, space, time and the exploration of the galaxy. Sagan is particularly focused on the use of radio astronomy not only to identify far flung civilizations but to contact them. Cosmos was written before string theory, the multiverse, supersymmetry, dark matter, dark energy and the Higgs boson became hot topics. Still his discussion holds up well. Sagan is enamored with interacting with other civilizations. I am not sure this is a good idea but danger from aliens seems far less likely than danger from our fellow man. In trying to calculate the number of advanced civilizations in the universe, a key factor is how long a civilization can last before it destroys itself. We have only very recently gotten to the point where we can reach out to other worlds and between climate change, nuclear war, and other self-destructive behavior our future is clearly tenuous. Sagan takes this worry very seriously and persuades me to as well. Perhaps our search for intelligent life on other worlds has borne no fruit because intelligent life is a misnomer. "

The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we've learned most of what we know. Recently, we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from.We long to returnand we can .because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of starstuff 
i don't think i'll ever give 5 stars more wholeheartedly as i am doing now ..5 shimmering , eye-blindingly shinning stars , the brightest suns GR has in its this little galaxy should be owned by this book , cosmos .its really shocking that only days ago i didnt know who carl sagan is . The name may have seemed a bit familiar , but nothing more Now , this name feels too meaningful , i'd remember this man's words , his deep voice discussing the formations of the stars and their decay and deaths , i'd surly remember the passion in his eyes in the parallel Cosmos TV show , the way he pronounces Billions and Billions stressing on the B or the way he says  ""we are made of starstuff"" with too much longing . I LOVED THIS BOOK  it maybe mainstream and often said but i dont know how to phrase what i feel about it any other way , seems its beyond my ability of putting things into coherent sentences .it was Beautiful  in every mean , i wish now that i have saved every beautiful i've ever used , ever said , so that when i call this peace of heaven beautiful you would get what i am saying ..quoting from the same book , cosmos is :
""visually and musically stunning, and to engage the heart as well as the mind""
Carl Sagan , an astronomer, a cosmologist and a writer. a brilliant man . the way he uses words , it doesnt feel decorated , these words are written too honestly , the passions and ambitions of a man ,once a child inlove with science-fiction as we all are , scriped in papers .I feel too ashamed that i am 22 years living in this world and its only now that i read this book , Cosmos wasn't only about astronomy , but philosophy , biology and a big deal of history all written very beautifully you will enjoy every bit , i started to love radio waves , Phythagorean laws and things of this sort that i may have considered dry and lifeless in my school years . its hard to believe that this is written in the eighties of the last century , may be so much had changed , maybe some stuff here and there are not up to date but its is still a big source of inspiration . The question about extraterrestial life remains a puzzle , but exploring the problem is a fascinating journey in itself .I am not an expert on natural science , a mere starter , but it was easy for me to read , so i think carl sagan's books are gems of some sort , they are the bridge between scientists and common people , they are written for us , we who love the stars and crave to understand them yet we are no scientists or experts our selves . and generally expertise in the subject matter is not required to enjoy it , as the love of it shall demonstrates. I am officaily recommending this book for every human being , its a thing every soul should read .i wish i can buy enough copies for the human race and shove them down their doors . 
""Finally, at the end of all our wanderings, we return to our tiny, fragile, blue-white world, lost in a cosmic ocean vast beyond our most courageous imaginings.

I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky*We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever*Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations*The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion* (1033, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called compelling. Worlds are precious*Each star system is an island in space, quarantined from its neighbors by the light- years. I can imagine creatures evolving into glimmerings of knowledge on innumerable worlds, every one of them assuming at first their puny planet and paltry few suns to be all that is. We grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves the Cosmos*Welcome to the planet Earth - a place of blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water, cool forests and soft meadows, a world positively rippling with life. In the cosmic perspective it is, as I have said, poignantly beautiful and rare; but it is also, for the moment, unique*The study of the heavens brought Ptolemy a kind of ecstasy. ‘ Mortal as I am,’ he wrote, ‘ I know that I am born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth. . *With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist . . . I yield freely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the book - to be read either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness*With searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and everything suffused in an eerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the goddess of love than the incarnation of hell*All that matters is the evidence, and the evidence is not yet in.*The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished*there are regularities in Nature that permit its secrets to be uncovered. Nature is not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered and admirable character of the universe was called Cosmos*Traveling close to the speed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down close to the speed of light, special relativity provides us with a means of going to the stars*A star is a phoenix, destined to rise for a time from its own ashes*Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival*Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species*The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons. The radio and radar techniques employed to track and guide ballistic missiles and defend against attack are also used to monitor and command the spacecraft on the planets and to listen for signals from civilizations near other stars. If we use these technologies to destroy ourselves, we surely will venture no more to the planets and the stars. But the converse is also true. If we continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will be shaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will recognize that our explorations can be carried out only on behalf of all the people of the planet Earth"

Both of the before mentioned apply to me, but why do I say it has a special meaning? Well, as simple as it may sound, this book was what took me to where I am right now. There has always been magic for me. As a kid, I always believed in everything everyone else seemed to despise and so it was my faith that my parents even got to think that I was crazy.First, there were these magical creatures: faeries, mermaids, goblins, wizards, etc. Then something even better and more magical came to my life: science. Now you may be thinking, okay, but science is a wide subject, what part of science? And I will answer you: why do I have to choose from it when I can learn from all of it? That’s something taught me. Science is connected to everything in ways that some of us have never imagined. If we talk about science, we must think of it as the most important discovery in the history of humanity, of art, religion, music, and beauty in its fullest expression. One can’t live without the other, they are the things that give form and purpose to our existence. Since I find myself unfit to give a decent critic to the book (not because I lack knowledge but for the role, it played and keeps playing in my life), I’m going to invite you to think a little bit.Imagine yourself as a 6-year old kid. You are in the countryside, separated from any sound or human contact, and the only light is the one that comes from the starts you are currently watching. You feel happy about your loneliness. You don’t know anything about the matter and yet you have a feeling that there’s some magic in the sky, some kind of spell written in it. Suddenly the stars are passing by, leaving a blur of light on their tray and you wonder how some stars can move and fall while others keep doing their job, brightening everything around you. You run to the house at the other side of the camp, and turn to see the stars again, they are still there, the same stars every day, you are scared because you don’t understand and that makes you feel uneasy. You go to sleep. Next morning you wake up and go directly to the nearest library, you ask for books of stars, but the librarian tells you she has none and instead she gives you a physics, religion and art books, what a disappointment you think. You see the pictures and read as much as you can, it isn’t an easy task, though, you have barely learned to read. The hours passed by, and by the end of the day, you realized how much you have learned, not only about physics and stars but also about religion, math, and arts. It’s then when you as a 6-years old kid find the most valuable treasure when you were only looking to understand the stars. As I said before, there is no way of reviewing this book correctly."

Scientific information is explained in ""simple reader"" language.The focus in this book is on astronomy : how big is our universe, how old it is, how it ""works"", etc. Sagan pays a lot of attention to stars and galaxies, but also presents the more advanced topics of black holes and pulsars. There are also occasional earthly detours - evolution of life on earth, ancient greeks, the library of Alexandria, voyages of explorers, etc. The book also tries to bring up some philosophical questions, especially in relation to the possibility of other civilizations in the cosmos, and how a contact between us and them would happen.Highly recommendation!===================

Carl Sagan, in a companion compendium to his 13-part 1980 TV series of the same name, explains what we know about the universe and the progression of human thought about origins and the nature of reality. We zoom across frames of reference, from the actions of atoms and subatomic particles, to the molecules that store genetic information, to life on this planet, and beyond, to the structure of the universe. We learn about the various explorations of Mars, Venus, Io and Europa, and how we might travel to stars in the future. Along the way, Sagan explains not just what we know, but how we know it, and the fascinating stories of how that information was discovered: often by brilliance or persistence, and sometimes by historical accident or sheer luck. His enthusiasm is readily apparent: infectious and infused with a positive vision for the world and the future. One can only wish that more people on Earth shared Sagan's perspective.The book is punctuated with quotes from various myths of the universe's origins, which serve to remind us how important these questions have always been, but also how poorly equipped we are to access answers through intuition alone. It is the scientific method that has allowed us to cumulatively add new knowledge. He quotes Seneca, from the first century CE: ""There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate... Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all."" Seneca saw clearly, and Sagan shares the stories of thinkers like Pythagoras, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Huygens, Newton and Einstein and the various contributions they made to our modern understanding.I listened to the audio version, read by LeVar Burton, which is fantastic. I then picked up my physical copy to re-read the quotes and footnotes and see the included charts and illustrations. I highly recommend this for everyone... even if you have a strong understanding of science, it is worth it just to hear Sagan's brilliant and beautifully crafted explanations."

First thing that captivates me that despite being a nonfiction scientific book, Carl Sagan described the whole universe, explained the science in such a poetic and eloquent way that you would think he is a romantic poet! And the parts about his childhood and his enthusiasm for astronomy, for cosmos were the cutest and beautiful thing I have ever read. I saw myself, my passion for space in him, in his writings. And best part of this book was the incredible ideas that can belong to a sci-fi writer! I even took notes from this ideas so maybe I can use them in my future writings. Carl Sagan became my favorite person in science))) And this book will be forever my favorite and I am sure I will read it again and again and also recommend it as a teacher)) And these are my favorite quotes:“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” “What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“we make our world significant by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers”"

88,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"When do we truly die ? The most logical answer would be to say that we die when the last breath escapes us and when our body and mind cease to function. But I tend to differ , death would be the loss of fascination and wonderment at the world around us. To wake up and see the sun rise everyday, to listen to birdsong in the mornings and see the blue sky above you, to feel the rain lashing at you and at times caressing you with its softness, the gentle breeze of the evenings, the feel of the sea waves beneath your toes....this is life ! And when a time arrives during which none of this can be felt with the same sense of wanton bliss, I shall call it death. If ever there arises a world like Cormac McCarthy's The Road envisaged, I would go insane in a couple of days at the most ! This digression is very much in line with Carl Sagan's work for he speaks to us about our home : Earth. His voice is one of clear reason and indefatigable energy that I was filled with a sense of elation to say the least. You hold his hand and walk with him, a kid who for the first time stepped into a science class with eyes as wide and big as glass marbles ! Even when he tells you that you are nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in the order of things in the galaxy, he continues to say  But look around you, isn't the Earth the most beautiful thing you ever saw ?  Sagan conducts a virtual tour through the history of human civilizations, astronomy, the rise of science, interstellar and interplanetary travel and also ponders for a chapter on the perceived nature of extra terrestrial intelligence. What makes it marvelous reading ? One word : Simplicity ! He never writes a word that a common man needs to break his head over. Yes, there are graphical representations and equations galore in the book but even if you skip them and keep reading you will not be at a loss. Things are kept to the simplest way possible, a spade is called a spade and there are no unnecessary theatrics. I have not seen the TV series that inspired this book but am surely going to go in search of it ! Recommended for those with a love for nature and science."
89,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45702383-a-l-buehrer,2," Let me just say this, I love science as much as anybody else, but I can love it without getting weird about it.  I guess I was expecting this book to be something it wasn't. It's really just a humanist philosophy book. I was expecting to learn something. I read science books to stretch my mind, not to be preached at. This was the preachiest science book I have ever read. Carl Sagan obviously literally worships science. This book was really just a hymn to science, not really delving into any particular part of it enough to really be interesting. I was disappointed enough in Sagan's writing to seriously consider taking ""The Pale Blue Dot"" off my reading list. His tone is so condescending. I decided to read it anyway. Just to give him a second chance. I'm just saying, he's not making my favorite authors list by any means. "

91,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,5,"I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of 9/11 and the world in the new millennium, a strife-torn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment. I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over. And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the 'neutrinos being speedier than light particles' experiment that had made the headlines a few years ago.I can only imagine because he wasn't there to witness these watershed events and he isn't here to offer comment, criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer. His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work - a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universe(s). 
""Our familiar universe of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in the next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.""
It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the 13 chapters of 'Cosmos' and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time, the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet. I could write a review in the conventional format, leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you can.Or, instead, I could simply write about how, despite being more than 30 years outdated, Carl Sagan's voice of reason rings truer than ever, cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times. I could just tell you how Sagan's deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries, across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides, symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge.
""There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human invention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised.""
The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history, the Soviet Union is no more, America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President. But turmoil in the world order persists - the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region. The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past, if not more. Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits, blatant human rights violations, infringement on freedom of speech and expression, diplomatic arm-wrestling, the ever-enthusiastic decriers of science, 'War on Women', the shouts of the global-warming deniers reign supreme still. The players may have changed faces but the game of petty one-upmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabated.Which is why Sagan's rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being. His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances, of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority, impresses upon us a sense of urgency - that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers, the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced. As the concept of 'nuclear deterrence' receives a pat on the back, the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control, more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars, galaxies and universes. The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominy.Is it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria, the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes, Democritus, Aristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Christiaan Huygens, Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for? To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete self-annihilation?Sagan thinks not.
""Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for the Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.""
 This is why I can't help but agree quite heartily with someone who says 'If I had a religion, I would be a Carl Saganian.'
""If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.""
If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith, let it be this one."
92,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,5,"The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book. Gosh, I should not use the term ‘absolutely’ for something in which everything orbits around relativity.Anyway, I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book: my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars, …and expanding. My rating:What a brilliant read this has been. I have read it very slowly; one chapter a week. But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time? I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs. What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room, bringing home and explaining to me, the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable time.Sagan’s mind is truly cosmic, in scope and in outlook. We accompany him as he pulls together history, with the pre-Socratic, the Alexandrians, Leonardo, Kepler and Tycho Brahe, Huygens, Einstein, with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy. I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa, in a true Pasolini manner. I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his half-observed-half-fictional universe. I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft, realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early 1980s when Sagan’s program and book were all the rage, and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitous.I loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid, when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses. Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy. Unforgettable.The contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universe--the language of science--, which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions. But a running argument, and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program, is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies: superstition and violence.Produced during the Cold War, the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of self-destruction. His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projection.But the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being. But also how, in spite of my own insignificance, how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elements.Rather than depressing, I have found this thought heartening. A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lasts.Which means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium, invented by us. Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian Library.He understood."

I'm glad I did; I was able to project the image and voice of Carl Sagan into the words on the page.

94,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397575-daniella,5,"I'm not sure what I could possibly say about Cosmos that hasn't already been said by countless others in the 28 years since its publication, and likely in a far more intelligent and eloquent way than I ever could. But upon recently reading this book for the first time (which may seem a bit belated, but I am, after all, only 23) it instantly became one of my favorites, a status not easily attained by any book, and so I feel compelled to say something, to expound upon its many virtues and why it has endeared itself to me so completely.""One glance at [a book:] and you hear the voice of another person--perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time.""Perhaps prophetically, this is exactly the effect the late great Dr. Sagan acheived with this book. Through the power and fluid elegance of his prose, while reading Cosmos I could almost hear that familiar and somehow majestic voice (which in large part, I believe, made the PBS miniseries of the same name so wholly entrancing), as if the two of us were old friends having a leisurely, albeit profoundly intellectual, chat over coffee. Not exactly what one might expect from a book largely concerned with science, but this is just one of many qualities that makes it not only endearing to the reader, but also--and perhaps more importantly--accessible, making even the smattering of complex equations seem casual and undaunting.Aside from the beauty of its prose, which is at times poetic in its depth and its eloquence, Cosmos is also wholly engaging and fascinating in the depth and scope of its subects. Sagan succinctly and expertly covers everything from the birth of stars to the birth of science, the origins of life on Earth to the possibility of life on other planets, and our far distant and recent (in the grand cosmic scheme of things) past to the possibilities for our distant future. And yes, because science is constantly evolving and, as Dr. Sagan states, self-correcting, some of the information and theories covered may now be outdated, but I still believe that Cosmos is well worth reading. Not only can it serve as a friendly, accessible, and engrossing jumping-off point for we common folk who are interested in delving deeper into science but may feel a bit intimidated, it is also, if nothing else, worth reading for the beautifully poignant and evocative insights and the oft-philosophical tidbits contained therein.""We are the local embodiment of the Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars....""My only complaints about Cosmos are these: the last two or three chapters lag just a bit, incorporating several topics that seem extraneous and unnecessary, and somewhat lose the smooth, easy flow present throughout the rest of the book; and though I feel that, in the current world political climate, the section discussing nuclear arms is still as relevant today as then, I can't help but think that anybody above the age of 12 and possessing a fully-functioning cerebral cortex is already aware of the potential consequences of nuclear war (gamma burst, radiation poisoning, junk in the atmosphere, nuclear winter, death, doom, destruction, we get it already). However, I can concede on this last point that, at the time of publication, the aftermath of a full-scale nuclear war was perhaps still a pretty hot topic. And in the grand scheme, these negative points make up only a negligible fraction of this otherwise fantastic book, and do not in anyway detract from its intrinsic value or from its overall enjoyability.All in all, Cosmos is a thoroughly enthralling read that takes you on a breath-taking journey from the inception of the Universe to futures that may never be, and allows us to ponder--when considering our own epic journey from starstuff to ""assemblages of a billion billion billion atoms contemplating the evolution of atoms""--what it truly means to be human and what our place, our purpose, is in the vast expanse of ""this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky""."

These flaws center on either Sagan's unusual speaking style and acting(?) abilities, or the show's contents. I certainly agree that he looks stupid when displaying the ""awed"" look; however, the complaints about the content of his shows are not justified. Yes, he is short on reasons and long on visual effects, and, yes, he talks as if the viewer did not know the obvious. What we are all forgetting is this: the average person doesn't know what we would consider ""obvious"". We should realize that Carl Sagan has his work cut out for him making science digestible for the average person."

Stars borrowed from skies that I witnessed when I was eight or maybe ten and would wake up early at pre-dawn, because that was the best time for star gazing after all. To read Mr.Sagan, the words so simple describing the Universe so complex. To read a small passage and follow it up with a sleep filled with dreams of all those stars dying and being born every passing moment.To recall, days of childish innocence gazing towards the infinite.Gazing in anticipation of recognizing a constellation or an anticipated meteor shower.To pause while reading and reflect, wonder. To attempt understanding things with closed eyes.To hear back from the infinite, after all these many years. Because thoughts might after all travel through vacuum.To think what has been thought centuries ago, but not by you yet.To take a possibility, and create countless possibilities.To be curious, to question. To look at things with not just your eyes.

97,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286151-z,5,"Let's put it simply. Cosmos is required reading for everyone who lives on this planet. It will give you a sense of perspective that nothing else can -- no lofty ideology, no omniscient religion, no inspiring quotations can explain things quite as clearly as Carl Sagan's treatise on science, reality, and the nature of things in this universe. Mind-bending and dazzling, and best of all, uncluttered by confusing scientific terminology. A book worthy of all the positive superlatives I can think of bestowing on it.We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different from us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think of the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and cultures of each of our civilisations merely represent different ways of being human. An extraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies, would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be densey populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.- Carl Sagan, Cosmos"
98,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,4,"Carl Sagan was a good writer. For a scientist, his prose had a literary style that is enjoyable to read, and he injected a sense of philosophy into his passionate account of the origins and marvels of the cosmos. I do find that the delivery was quite heavy-handed in trying to instill that sense of awe and wonder into the reader. What made it even more so was the narrator whose intonation carries a quality of breathless resonance. The arrangement of the subject matter also seemed a bit haphazard in my view. I couldn't help comparing this book to a favourite of mine - A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson which was organised, concise, informative, and very entertaining. Regardless, Cosmos is still a good primer to read for those who are interested in learning more about the universe and our world before venturing into more recent writings from the likes of Stephen Hawkings (may he rest in peace) and Neil deGrasse Tyson."
99,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"Re-visit 2016:1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean: After an introduction by Ann Druyan, including the benefits of the end of the Cold War, Carl Sagan opens the program with a description of the cosmos and a ""Spaceship of the Imagination"" (shaped like a dandelion seed). The ship journeys through the universes' hundred billion galaxies, the Local Group, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, the Orion Nebula, our Solar System, and finally the planet Earth. Eratosthenes' attempt to calculate the circumference of Earth leads to a description of the ancient Library of Alexandria. Finally, the ""Ages of Science"" are described, before pulling back to the full span of the Cosmic Calendar. 2: One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue : Sagan discusses the story of the Heike crab and artificial selection of crabs resembling samurai warriors, as an opening into a larger discussion of evolution through natural selection (and the pitfalls of the theory of intelligent design). Among the topics are the development of life on the Cosmic Calendar and the Cambrian explosion; the function of DNA in growth; genetic replication, repairs, and mutation; the common biochemistry of terrestrial organisms; the creation of the molecules of life in the Miller-Urey experiment; and speculation on alien life (such as life in Jupiter's clouds). In the Cosmos Update ten years later, Sagan remarks on RNA also controlling chemical reactions and reproducing itself and the different roles of comets (potentially carrying organic molecules or causing the Cretaceous--Tertiary extinction event)This episode is worth 6* just on its ownHeaven and Hell: Sagan discusses comets and asteroids as planetary impactors, giving recent examples of the Tunguska event and a lunar impact described by Canterbury monks in 1178. It moves to a description of the environment of Venus, from the previous fantastic theories of people such as Immanuel Velikovsky to the information gained by the Venera landers and its implications for Earth's greenhouse effect. The Cosmos Update highlights the connection to global warming. 1908 Siberia Tunguska5: Blues for a red planet: The episode, devoted to the planet Mars, begins with scientific and fictional speculation about the Red Planet during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Edgar Rice Burroughs' science fiction books, and Percival Lowell's false vision of canals on Mars). It then moves to Robert Goddard's early experiments in rocket-building, inspired by reading science fiction, and the work by Mars probes, including the Viking, searching for life on Mars. The episode ends with the possibility of the terraforming and colonization of Mars and a Cosmos Update on the relevance of Mars' environment to Earth's and the possibility of a manned mission to Mars.6: Traveller's Tales: The journeys of the Voyager probes is put in the context of the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, with a centuries-long tradition of sailing ship explorers, and its contemporary thinks (such as Constantijn Huygens and his son Christian). Their discoveries are compared to the Voyager probes' discoveries among the Jovian and Saturn systems. In Cosmos Update, image processing reconstructs Voyager's worlds and Voyager's last portrait of the Solar System as it leaves is shown.Definitely need an up-to-date version with all that has been discovered since this was published in 1980"

Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us - there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries. ”With these lines, we hop on Sagan’s ‘ship of imagination’ to visit distant worlds of Quasars, Pulsars, Black holes and Galaxies that are billions of light years away from us. A peak into the Cosmos. Sagan is a poet-scientist, he uses beautiful metaphors and aphorisms that are never too far from what an ordinary person can grasp. The style is lucid. The knowledge ranges from Mathematics to history, from ancient Greece to NASA. Building on the works of geniuses who introduced us to this fascinating, mind boggling universe of ours.After giving us a general idea of our ‘cosmic address’, Sagan moves on to Darwin and his discovery of Natural Selection as the engine of Evolution. This has to be one of the finest explanations of Darwinian Natural Selection, where Sagan uses the extra-ordinary example Heike crabs, to demonstrate the strange but beautiful ways in which ‘survival of the fittest’ is manifested. But he doesn’t keep us here for long. After giving the best possible ‘lecture’ on Evolution, he takes us further to see the harmony of the worlds. the planets and how the stars follow fixed patterns that can be mathematically explained; a most singular achievement of humans to have discovered the language of the Nature. Kepler gave us the laws of planetary motion. Laws that not just explained the elliptical orbit of Earth, but inspired a generation of mathematicians and physicists to inquire further into the nature and behaviour of the heavenly bodies.  A world so strange, complex and inaccessible has been made fascinating, understandable and rather accessible by the works of men and women who devoted their lives to Science and Cosmos. A world that is far more rich and awe-inspiring than the meagre and myth-ridden fairytales that we content ourselves with. We settle for too little. As the book progresses, Sagan’s obsession with extra-terrestrial life becomes more and more apparent. He admits that as a child, he spent hours contemplating about the possibility of intelligent life on other planets. Although our search for intelligent life has been a failure (even on Earth), Sagan aspires to make contact with the dwellers of distant worlds. The possibility of life elsewhere, is not too ‘fantastic’ altogether. As we observe the immensity of the observable universe, we can be more than certain that life does exist elsewhere but we don’t know what it will be like. Space travel and Alien Contact are not stuff of science fiction anymore but a possibility in waiting. The concluding chapters touch on two matters of colossal significance, namely Nuclear Weapons and Climate Change. These two man-made disasters are a ticking time bomb that can obliterate our species, and we have done precious little to stop them. We are destroying this planet, poisoning our oceans and destroying Specie after specie for centuries now. Man is without a doubt the most deadly predator in the history of Earth Life. And now we are on the path to self-annihilation. And this book is a wakeup call. A world ridden with ignorance and greed, will need to forego the idiotic bliss of being certain about everything. We don’t need good answers to everything, what we need instead are good questions. A good question is often times more educating than its answer. How can we love this world if we are awaiting an apocalypse, how can we love our environment and its safe keepers, the plants and the animals, without recognising that they are our distant cousins. Life, wherever it exists on this planet, is our kin. And we are bullying, butchering and asphyxiating it everywhere. What a shame !This is the kind of book that we must read and re-read. A book we must gift our children on their 12th birthdays. If you haven’t read it yet and you are over 12, do your self a favour and read it.Because Carl Sagan does more than just educate you about the wonders of Science and the Universe; he makes you fall in love with it."

Еverything was a source of marvel and inspiration. The world, the Earth, waited to be discovered and I had a long life ahead of me to do that. Then, in teenage years, I already knew all there was to know about life, people, the Earth and the Universe. Nobody could tell me any better. The new source of wonder had become love – falling in love, finding the purpose in another human being, the complete merging of body and soul.Once I entered the world of adults, I realised that I knew nothing. I strived for a higher purpose which, it turned out, was extremely hard to find in between a daily job that gives you no thrill, the same four walls you hide behind every night, and the usual faces that say the same words day in day out. The mundanity and routine that sustain a human life make it really hard to notice this same life. Wine and poetry help the cause to some extent, but they pull one out of Earth’s gravity for very short instances only.I have been at a crossroads lately, which shattered the illusive security of existence and made me anxious, itching with questions, sleepless, feeling an urge I couldn’t define. And then I started to seek answers, cosmic answers.Suddenly, it feels like a meteorite has hit my little planet. I read with eyes wide-open, with the naïveté of a toddler, with a remarkable ignorance and with an insatiable thirst to learn more. I feel like a child again! I feel in love again! I feel my senses being heightened and my pulse rushing. Carl Sagan made me feel like a scientist. For I have made a wonderful discovery - the nutrient of my little earthly life is curiosity – no step for the Cosmos, one giant leap for the cosmic speck of dust that I am.I could talk for hours about how beautiful and captivating I found Cosmos to be. It made me crave knowledge of the unknown. It made my underdeveloped imagination burst with colourful visions. It made my stunted mind race. I savoured every word, embraced every idea. I guess for someone who has read a lot on the subject I look like a newly hatched chicken, struggling to make its first steps. I have been intimidated by physics and chemistry all my life and now it is time to catch up.My gut tells me that Sagan is not right in completely rejecting astrology, the occult or religion, but I choose to trust him because he has managed to put into simple words concepts that have scared away so many people for so long. His narrative voice is the perfect combination of a bright mind and humility. It is subtle and guiding, not patronizing. It is human and it is humane – it makes you believe you can understand and dream beyond the boundaries of your own mind.Sagan was a great scientist, but I think his greatest achievement is that he made science accessible and interesting to his fellow human beings. His venture to bring the Cosmos closer to humans might eventually pay off in helping bring humans closer to the Cosmos. There is so much more I want to say, but I don’t have words for all thoughts that Cosmos provoked in me. I feel ashamed that my review of this monumental work revolves around my little nichtigkeit, but, after all, even the biggest galaxies are made of the smallest particles."
104,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,5,"A gorgeous book in every possible way. From the lush illustration and clever diagrams clear through to Sagan's lyrical and at times whimsical narrative, this is the science book for non-scientists. (And if you are a scientist, may this be a lesson in how to tell your story.) Sagan makes the astronomy and the math and the mind-boggling complexity of the universe not only comprehensible but palatable. He wraps up our history as a species into the history of the universe (such that we can even know it).As a kid, I adored this book for the color plates. I would flip the pages in my Dad's copy over and over and over again. Down on the floor, on the couch -- anywhere. Probably every day from ages four through seventeen. I didn't go on to be an astronomer. Hell, I never took a physics class and I nearly failed more than one math class (as I recall) but this book...Reading it cover-to-cover for the first time as an adult, I was struck by many things. The book is dense but Sagan paces it well, makes you hungry for every anecdote about Kepler or Pythagoras, thirsty for the decimal-laden scientific notation.And then there was the moment that blew my mind; tucked away in a footnote about telescopic ""snapshots"" of galaxies:...The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than the far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in galactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen in one moment of time is small.!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
105,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70913-deb,1,"This book was my bible when I was an enemy of God. As a stubbornly devout atheist, this was the book I turned to for justification of my proud and arrogant rejection of my Creator. Instead of reading this pile of conjecture, I recommend reading the Holy Bible (then get on your knees and repent before the holy God who gave you life and sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for your lawlessness and sin). :-)"
106,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Sagan explores the history and future of cosmology with wonder and foreboding in this slightly dated but insightful and still highly relevant mix of science and philosophy. He begins with the story of Eratosthenes, the first to calculate the circumference of the earth in the third century BCE. His instruments were two sticks. He placed one vertically in the ground at the summer solstice on the equator and a second 800 kilometers north. At noon the first would give no shadow but the angle of the shadow of the second would correspond to that segment of the earth. Divide the angle (7 degrees) into 360, multiply it by 800 and you are pretty close to the actual circumference. Simple but brilliant!In the 6th century BCE Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras began laying the foundations of modern scientific thought from astronomy to mathematics to biology. The 6th century not only produced these brilliant Ionian Greeks, but Gautama Buddha in India, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Zoroaster in Persia, and Pharaoh Necho in Egypt who had Africa circumnavigated 2000 years before the Portuguese. Sagan questions whether this simultaneous explosion of new ideas could really be unrelated, but doesn’t suggest an answer. Unfortunately this burst of innovative thought wouldn’t last. Sagan points to the destruction of the library at Alexandria in the fourth century CE as a final blow to learning symbolizing the beginning of the Dark Ages. It would be another 1,000 years for this ancient knowledge to be rediscovered although much would be lost forever. Sagan suggests the rise of slavery led to the demise of the Ionian scientists. Slavery obviated the need for technology and set up the need for clear lines of demarcation of class to justify it. Thus working with the hands, engaging in ungentlemanly activity was wrong. Religion was employed to rationalize the institution. Today we are familiar with a more recent example, the antebellum South which failed to industrialize due to its reliance on slavery and ended up falling far behind the North.Sagan covers the 16th and 17th century contributions of Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, and Newton. Then he skips to the 1970’s discussing the Voyager missions, exploration of the solar system and the prospects for finding life. He presents the then current ideas on the nature of the universe discussing stars, space, time and the exploration of the galaxy. Sagan is particularly focused on the use of radio astronomy not only to identify far flung civilizations but to contact them. Cosmos was written before string theory, the multiverse, supersymmetry, dark matter, dark energy and the Higgs boson became hot topics. Still his discussion holds up well. Sagan is enamored with interacting with other civilizations. I am not sure this is a good idea but danger from aliens seems far less likely than danger from our fellow man. In trying to calculate the number of advanced civilizations in the universe, a key factor is how long a civilization can last before it destroys itself. We have only very recently gotten to the point where we can reach out to other worlds and between climate change, nuclear war, and other self-destructive behavior our future is clearly tenuous. Sagan takes this worry very seriously and persuades me to as well. Perhaps our search for intelligent life on other worlds has borne no fruit because intelligent life is a misnomer. "

The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we've learned most of what we know. Recently, we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from.We long to returnand we can .because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of starstuff 
i don't think i'll ever give 5 stars more wholeheartedly as i am doing now ..5 shimmering , eye-blindingly shinning stars , the brightest suns GR has in its this little galaxy should be owned by this book , cosmos .its really shocking that only days ago i didnt know who carl sagan is . The name may have seemed a bit familiar , but nothing more Now , this name feels too meaningful , i'd remember this man's words , his deep voice discussing the formations of the stars and their decay and deaths , i'd surly remember the passion in his eyes in the parallel Cosmos TV show , the way he pronounces Billions and Billions stressing on the B or the way he says  ""we are made of starstuff"" with too much longing . I LOVED THIS BOOK  it maybe mainstream and often said but i dont know how to phrase what i feel about it any other way , seems its beyond my ability of putting things into coherent sentences .it was Beautiful  in every mean , i wish now that i have saved every beautiful i've ever used , ever said , so that when i call this peace of heaven beautiful you would get what i am saying ..quoting from the same book , cosmos is :
""visually and musically stunning, and to engage the heart as well as the mind""
Carl Sagan , an astronomer, a cosmologist and a writer. a brilliant man . the way he uses words , it doesnt feel decorated , these words are written too honestly , the passions and ambitions of a man ,once a child inlove with science-fiction as we all are , scriped in papers .I feel too ashamed that i am 22 years living in this world and its only now that i read this book , Cosmos wasn't only about astronomy , but philosophy , biology and a big deal of history all written very beautifully you will enjoy every bit , i started to love radio waves , Phythagorean laws and things of this sort that i may have considered dry and lifeless in my school years . its hard to believe that this is written in the eighties of the last century , may be so much had changed , maybe some stuff here and there are not up to date but its is still a big source of inspiration . The question about extraterrestial life remains a puzzle , but exploring the problem is a fascinating journey in itself .I am not an expert on natural science , a mere starter , but it was easy for me to read , so i think carl sagan's books are gems of some sort , they are the bridge between scientists and common people , they are written for us , we who love the stars and crave to understand them yet we are no scientists or experts our selves . and generally expertise in the subject matter is not required to enjoy it , as the love of it shall demonstrates. I am officaily recommending this book for every human being , its a thing every soul should read .i wish i can buy enough copies for the human race and shove them down their doors . 
""Finally, at the end of all our wanderings, we return to our tiny, fragile, blue-white world, lost in a cosmic ocean vast beyond our most courageous imaginings. It is a world among an immensity of others. It may be significant only for us. The Earth is our home, our parent. Our kind of life arose and evolved here. The human species is coming of age here. It is on this world that we developed our passion for exploring the Cosmos, and it is here that we are, in some pain and with no guarantees, working out our destiny """"There will be no humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an endangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another""
Warning ! : dont you ever miss meeting the deep voice narrating to you the story of the cosmos , watch the TV show , meet carl sagan , I'll put links for the 13 episodes downwards .Advice : read the book with some cosmic music , it will feel magical and out of the world .The TV show episodes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ9mz...i've read it as an ebook copy and i think half the book is marked blue , its just too charming you would want to remember every word , now i have my pockets full of fascinating quotes . and these are some i couldn't resist including in the review :* They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky*We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever*Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations*The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place. No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty. The only typical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of intergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos, the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a billion trillion trillion* (1033, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are called compelling. Worlds are precious*Each star system is an island in space, quarantined from its neighbors by the light- years. I can imagine creatures evolving into glimmerings of knowledge on innumerable worlds, every one of them assuming at first their puny planet and paltry few suns to be all that is. We grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves the Cosmos*Welcome to the planet Earth - a place of blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water, cool forests and soft meadows, a world positively rippling with life. In the cosmic perspective it is, as I have said, poignantly beautiful and rare; but it is also, for the moment, unique*The study of the heavens brought Ptolemy a kind of ecstasy. ‘ Mortal as I am,’ he wrote, ‘ I know that I am born for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth. . *With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than an hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist . . . I yield freely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the book - to be read either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as God Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness*With searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and everything suffused in an eerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the goddess of love than the incarnation of hell*All that matters is the evidence, and the evidence is not yet in.*The Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished*there are regularities in Nature that permit its secrets to be uncovered. Nature is not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered and admirable character of the universe was called Cosmos*Traveling close to the speed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down close to the speed of light, special relativity provides us with a means of going to the stars*A star is a phoenix, destined to rise for a time from its own ashes*Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival*Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted from Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the entire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to make our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species*The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to the planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power sources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear weapons. The radio and radar techniques employed to track and guide ballistic missiles and defend against attack are also used to monitor and command the spacecraft on the planets and to listen for signals from civilizations near other stars. If we use these technologies to destroy ourselves, we surely will venture no more to the planets and the stars. But the converse is also true. If we continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will be shaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will recognize that our explorations can be carried out only on behalf of all the people of the planet Earth"

Both of the before mentioned apply to me, but why do I say it has a special meaning? Well, as simple as it may sound, this book was what took me to where I am right now. There has always been magic for me. As a kid, I always believed in everything everyone else seemed to despise and so it was my faith that my parents even got to think that I was crazy.First, there were these magical creatures: faeries, mermaids, goblins, wizards, etc. Then something even better and more magical came to my life: science. Now you may be thinking, okay, but science is a wide subject, what part of science? And I will answer you: why do I have to choose from it when I can learn from all of it? That’s something taught me. Science is connected to everything in ways that some of us have never imagined. If we talk about science, we must think of it as the most important discovery in the history of humanity, of art, religion, music, and beauty in its fullest expression. One can’t live without the other, they are the things that give form and purpose to our existence. Since I find myself unfit to give a decent critic to the book (not because I lack knowledge but for the role, it played and keeps playing in my life), I’m going to invite you to think a little bit.Imagine yourself as a 6-year old kid. You are in the countryside, separated from any sound or human contact, and the only light is the one that comes from the starts you are currently watching. You feel happy about your loneliness. You don’t know anything about the matter and yet you have a feeling that there’s some magic in the sky, some kind of spell written in it. Suddenly the stars are passing by, leaving a blur of light on their tray and you wonder how some stars can move and fall while others keep doing their job, brightening everything around you. You run to the house at the other side of the camp, and turn to see the stars again, they are still there, the same stars every day, you are scared because you don’t understand and that makes you feel uneasy. You go to sleep. Next morning you wake up and go directly to the nearest library, you ask for books of stars, but the librarian tells you she has none and instead she gives you a physics, religion and art books, what a disappointment you think. You see the pictures and read as much as you can, it isn’t an easy task, though, you have barely learned to read. The hours passed by, and by the end of the day, you realized how much you have learned, not only about physics and stars but also about religion, math, and arts. It’s then when you as a 6-years old kid find the most valuable treasure when you were only looking to understand the stars. As I said before, there is no way of reviewing this book correctly."
110,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938805-brian,5,"This is one of those kind of books that comes along every few years that is so fantastic that you purposely drag out reading it in order to savor its awesomeness. It doesn't matter that it was written 25+ years ago, pre-Hubble telescope, before the fall of the USSR, etc. - Sagan's insight and wide-reaching scope are timeless.The last few chapters are so rich in thought-provoking information they are worth re-reading. Sagan would have never wanted his work to become the foundation of a religion, but I can see why so many people refer to this as their ""bible"" and use it to help make sense out of a mad world and one's short time to inhabit it."

This is one of the best popular scientific books that I have read. This book is well written, reads like a mystery novel and is a great source of interesting information. Scientific information is explained in ""simple reader"" language.The focus in this book is on astronomy : how big is our universe, how old it is, how it ""works"", etc. Sagan pays a lot of attention to stars and galaxies, but also presents the more advanced topics of black holes and pulsars. There are also occasional earthly detours - evolution of life on earth, ancient greeks, the library of Alexandria, voyages of explorers, etc. The book also tries to bring up some philosophical questions, especially in relation to the possibility of other civilizations in the cosmos, and how a contact between us and them would happen.Highly recommendation!===================

This book is really very impressive. A story of 15 billion years of the cosmos compressed in this relatively smaller book! Easy to read and understand, Carl Sagan's Cosmos draws the reader into a world so vivid and realistic that it's hard not to be mesmerized throughout while reading this book."
114,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3," I wish I had LOVED this book as Carl Sagan is an icon. It was entertaining, if you ignore the fact that it is VERY dated (I mean, 40+ years dated), which is not its fault. However, I much prefer A Short History of Nearly Everything for a review of the same information. "
115,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Cosmos operates at a massive scale worthy of its lofty title. Carl Sagan, in a companion compendium to his 13-part 1980 TV series of the same name, explains what we know about the universe and the progression of human thought about origins and the nature of reality. We zoom across frames of reference, from the actions of atoms and subatomic particles, to the molecules that store genetic information, to life on this planet, and beyond, to the structure of the universe. We learn about the various explorations of Mars, Venus, Io and Europa, and how we might travel to stars in the future. Along the way, Sagan explains not just what we know, but how we know it, and the fascinating stories of how that information was discovered: often by brilliance or persistence, and sometimes by historical accident or sheer luck. His enthusiasm is readily apparent: infectious and infused with a positive vision for the world and the future. One can only wish that more people on Earth shared Sagan's perspective.The book is punctuated with quotes from various myths of the universe's origins, which serve to remind us how important these questions have always been, but also how poorly equipped we are to access answers through intuition alone. It is the scientific method that has allowed us to cumulatively add new knowledge. He quotes Seneca, from the first century CE: ""There will come a time when our descendants will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them... Many discoveries are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced. Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate... Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all."" Seneca saw clearly, and Sagan shares the stories of thinkers like Pythagoras, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Huygens, Newton and Einstein and the various contributions they made to our modern understanding.I listened to the audio version, read by LeVar Burton, which is fantastic. I then picked up my physical copy to re-read the quotes and footnotes and see the included charts and illustrations. I highly recommend this for everyone... even if you have a strong understanding of science, it is worth it just to hear Sagan's brilliant and beautifully crafted explanations."
116,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36595208-n-rmin,5,"It took me long to read it, but it was worth it. First thing that captivates me that despite being a nonfiction scientific book, Carl Sagan described the whole universe, explained the science in such a poetic and eloquent way that you would think he is a romantic poet! And the parts about his childhood and his enthusiasm for astronomy, for cosmos were the cutest and beautiful thing I have ever read. I saw myself, my passion for space in him, in his writings. And best part of this book was the incredible ideas that can belong to a sci-fi writer! I even took notes from this ideas so maybe I can use them in my future writings. Carl Sagan became my favorite person in science))) And this book will be forever my favorite and I am sure I will read it again and again and also recommend it as a teacher)) And these are my favorite quotes:“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” “What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“we make our world significant by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers”"

118,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"When do we truly die ? The most logical answer would be to say that we die when the last breath escapes us and when our body and mind cease to function. But I tend to differ , death would be the loss of fascination and wonderment at the world around us. To wake up and see the sun rise everyday, to listen to birdsong in the mornings and see the blue sky above you, to feel the rain lashing at you and at times caressing you with its softness, the gentle breeze of the evenings, the feel of the sea waves beneath your toes....this is life ! And when a time arrives during which none of this can be felt with the same sense of wanton bliss, I shall call it death. If ever there arises a world like Cormac McCarthy's The Road envisaged, I would go insane in a couple of days at the most ! This digression is very much in line with Carl Sagan's work for he speaks to us about our home : Earth. His voice is one of clear reason and indefatigable energy that I was filled with a sense of elation to say the least. You hold his hand and walk with him, a kid who for the first time stepped into a science class with eyes as wide and big as glass marbles ! Even when he tells you that you are nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in the order of things in the galaxy, he continues to say  But look around you, isn't the Earth the most beautiful thing you ever saw ?  Sagan conducts a virtual tour through the history of human civilizations, astronomy, the rise of science, interstellar and interplanetary travel and also ponders for a chapter on the perceived nature of extra terrestrial intelligence. What makes it marvelous reading ? One word : Simplicity ! He never writes a word that a common man needs to break his head over. Yes, there are graphical representations and equations galore in the book but even if you skip them and keep reading you will not be at a loss. Things are kept to the simplest way possible, a spade is called a spade and there are no unnecessary theatrics. I have not seen the TV series that inspired this book but am surely going to go in search of it ! Recommended for those with a love for nature and science."

I guess I was expecting this book to be something it wasn't. It's really just a humanist philosophy book. I was expecting to learn something. I read science books to stretch my mind, not to be preached at. This was the preachiest science book I have ever read. Carl Sagan obviously literally worships science. This book was really just a hymn to science, not really delving into any particular part of it enough to really be interesting. I was disappointed enough in Sagan's writing to seriously consider taking ""The Pale Blue Dot"" off my reading list. His tone is so condescending. I decided to read it anyway. Just to give him a second chance. I'm just saying, he's not making my favorite authors list by any means. "

“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”
Remarkable, strong, well crafted, Cosmos as far as I am concerned is a masterpiece of popular science.Carl Sagan is now one of my favorite authors and a person I greatly admire. You can see plainly how much effort was put into this book, and how genuine it is. To put it simply, he is a great writer and a great person.This book was meant as a companion to the TV show Cosmos (1980), a masterpiece on its own accord, I advise going over the two together and following up with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.As to the contents of this book, it is fair to say this book encompasses a great deal of information ranging between science and history, I guess I would call it a history of science, but it also touches on many other fields such as civilization, philosophy, and religion.The scientific fields the book goes through are many, but the main focus is, of course, astronomy.However, I would not recommend this book for its scientific content, as a lot has changed since 1980, almost 40 years now. Not that what we knew back then is now irrelevant, just less relevant as new information go piled on top of it.I recommend reading this book for several reasons. Sagan himself as one, I believe everyone should get acquainted with the men, what way would be better than hearing his words? Two, this book serves as a near-perfect gateway for astronomy and science in general, a kind of why you should care answer. Three, the historical view and perspective over the development of science are very enlightening, one can never know enough of one's own species. Four, a vision of where we are, how we came to be, and where we are going.I am pretty sure there is more, that was just off the top of my head.What I might criticize about this book is some repetitions, it made this feel less like a book and more like speech, and also like Sagan was trying to sell something, his points about extraterrestrial life and views on religion to be specific. Also, this is not exactly a very scientific book, nor an objective historical account, but that may not be a concern as it is not sold as one or the other. Arguably, if it was one of those it would not have been as beautiful and attractive. It would not have achieved as wide as an impact as it had. The emotion is a great part of why this book is so valuable.I recommend this book, for fun, for knowledge, for humanity.“What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.”“The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”"

It is not cutting edge today but the poetry and wonder of Carl Sagan's vision still is current. Reading this book 36 years after the series reminds me of how science and a vision of universe can inspire people long after the science of the book has been surpassed. Beautiful book.

It is us understanding, getting to know who we really are. So many questions are still out there, but we, the people in our wonderful and unique planet, have been able to wonder, search, and find answers always closer to the truth thanks to science.Life is so wonderful and rare, and I'm so happy my life took place in this period of time when we have been able to inherit the science and knowledge of so many generations of people and such brilliant minds as Erathostenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, and so many others. I have to make a special mention of Christian Huygens, a brilliant man I barely knew about. I definitely want to read much more about him. Also Hipatia, the last guardian of the library of Alexandria. I experienced once more the pity and overwhelming sorrow for such terrible loss. Well, in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about the path of science from the beginning, when men began to wonder, question, and learn to have a conscience of our existence and who we are up to this point when we have developed technology that allows us to keep learning about other places in our Universe beyond the only place we have ever known and where everything has ever happened to each person that has ever existed: our Earth. My final feeling is still this great awe about us, about every form of life that we see as normal and common. I share Sagan's thoughts about how pointless wars are, and hope that we can survive past them and humanity can finally learn to live only to build and perpetuate life in all its forms. If you haven't read this book yet, read it. For me it's one of those ""must""."
125,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44347175-rashit,4,"Carl Sagan presents us with a journey from the Library of Alexandria to the void of the universe. This journey is mostly a scientific journey. From time to time, non-scientific elements become part of this journey. So the book doesn't contain very heavy information. Anyway, Sagan's tongue quite understandable. That's the most powerful side of the book. On the other hand, due to science is constantly improving, some information isn't up to date. He updates some information in Cosmos's documentary. That information will be insufficient over time. Although he protects his objectivity in the whole book, he loses his objectivity in a few places. The reason is the western admiration. He says that in the development of scientific civilization, the weight of west is. This attitude isn’t scientific. Because the basis of today's science occurs works which done in the Library of Alexandria period (Sagan also agrees). After the library was burned, burned books haven’t reached today (He agrees again). It isn't known most of those books of their titles and their writers (He continues to agree). Well, if there are many writers from that library that we don't know, how can we talk so confidently about the fact that science is based on the west?"

“Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life—moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.”
Cosmos contained a great deal of information, much of which was engaging. The subject matter included: a history of humanity’s quest for understanding and notable scientific discoveries, evolution and genetics, some basic chemistry and physics (including a brief description of relativity), and, of course, astronomy. The following are some of the astronomy topics covered: the Big Bang, the life cycles of stars, details about many of our solar system’s planets and their satellites, information on a few NASA space missions, and speculation about intelligent alien life.Overall, while Cosmos was a very comprehensive summary of many different branches of knowledge, I really didn’t care for Sagan’s writing style. The first issue I had with his style is that he was often overly lyrical/mystical in tone. The text was abundantly peppered with phrases such as “the bastion and the citadel of the stars.” In my opinion, science and math are beautiful just as they are, and so dressing them up in flowery language is overkill, and can even be counterproductive. An example of this type of thing occurred when Sagan discussed nuclear fusion in stars, and where heavier chemical elements come from. This is a truly fascinating process. But then Sagan goes on to state that: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” I’m assuming he included that last sentence because he wanted readers to feel pretty pleased with ourselves…we’re all literally made out of stars! Far out! How cool are we? But if you think about it, excrement can lay claim to the same stellar forebears, which somewhat diminishes that beautiful, lofty sentiment we’re (presumably) supposed to be feeling about ourselves.My other issue with the writing is that, when it was not waxing poetic, it tended to be far too dumbed down. True, he was trying to reach a very large audience, many of whom have no background in science. That said, it would have been nice to read a book written for grown-ups.Overall, the book was just okay for me. Maybe it’s more exciting to those who haven’t taken an Intro to Astronomy course. If you’ve already studied Astronomy 101, however, there is nothing in either the writing or the personal opinions presented herein that qualify this as a must-read book."
127,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,5,"We humans have come a long way. From the days we were wandering the planet looking little different from our primate cousins, to these modern times where we take for granted technologies that would have been equated to magic just a century or so ago, we humans have made amazing progress. Science is what brought us here and science is what is going to help us evolve in the days ahead too. Science helped us see things as they are, dispelled our fears, gave us hope, made us discover fire and invent the wheel – two of the most important findings till today. While science may not have solved all our queries yet - and raises as many demons as it lays to rest - it makes genuine, continuous efforts to arrive at the Truth. Armed with science, we humans have started exploring all around us. From the microcosmic wonders of atoms to the mega marvels of Universe, science has lifted many veils and shown us things beyond our limited understanding. Scientists like Carl Sagan have played an important role in lifting those veils, not only by their direct contribution to the sciences, but also through their ability to communicate such esoteric wisdom to the masses, to laymen that are keen on understanding their surroundings but limited in their ability to do so.Books like ‘The Origin of Species’ remain special, not just because they tell us about groundbreaking discoveries, but also due to their telling it in a language that we, the laypersons, can understand. While ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan may not be as earth-shattering as ‘The Origin of Species’, it is special by its own right. Written nearly four decades ago, co-developed with a television series of the same name, this book was produced with the idea of popularizing the sciences, especially astronomy, among the masses. To the uninitiated but curious mind, this book is the ideal beginning into the wonderous realms of the cosmos. This book is to the budding astronomer what the alphabets and the arithmetic are to the young child.From the ancient budding of scientific thoughts at the Ionian islands to the then-latest launching of space missions like Voyager-2, Carl Sagan takes each stage in the evolution of science as we know it, elaborates on the circumstances prevailing at those times, enumerates important contributions by various scientists. The real fun is his doing all this in an interesting, pacey manner, without letting the reader feel bored even once. After helping us navigate the unimaginably vast expanse of our Universe and showing us the wonders of our solar system, stars, planets, galaxies and the bleak black holes along the way, Sagan ends the book with philosophical musings on the future of mankind on this nuclear era and the possibilities of our encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.This is not just a book on astronomy. Burgeoning with interesting details on history, evolution, atomic science and mathematics, this is one complete book that every mind passionate about learning must possess."

132,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365191-daniel,5,"I went into this book hoping to learn more about the Universe, and learn more I did. The chapters that dealt with star and galaxy formations were excellent, and many times I put down the book to look up something online. I had heard about a number of these topics in passing, and it was nice to read about them with more depth. For some reason, I was entranced by the concept of the 'heliopause' (look it up: it's freaking amazing), while I was outright blown away by the fact that both Voyager satellites are only a few years away from reaching this threshold of our solar system. In one of these searches, I discovered that you can subscribe to a Twitter feed for Voyager 2 that states (from a first-person POV, as if V2 is talking to you; nice) how far the satellite has traveled. According to a tweet that is one hour old (at 21:47 EST on 7/15/12), Voyager 2 was 13 hrs, 36 mins, and 44 seconds of light-travel time from Earth.One word: geekgasm.I enjoyed the historical passages, though I once again felt a massive need to branch out beyond the usual coterie of Greeks and Europeans. Sagan makes a passing reference to this cultural bias in his last chapter, stating that ""the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western Civilization"" (281). I want to contest this statement, and the fact that I feel ill-educated to do so is evidence that I have read far more about these portions of history than any other.Sagan includes passionate passages that touch upon our birthright as a species that, ultimately, comes from ""starstuff."" Though I have heard this idea before, Sagan writes about it with a conviction that snared my sympathies anew. His point is just as poignant today as it was 32 (damn) years ago: our specie's propensity for killing each other is frightening and tragic, and the billions of dollars that governments devote to this enterprise only divert our attention and energy from pursuits that could sustain humanity on this planet, if not propel it well beyond our own stellar backyard.This book awakened another perturbing thought: I should have read about this decades ago and read further thereafter. Better now, I suppose, than never."
133,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074534-emily,1,"I have heard great things about this book and Carl Sagan for so long that I am ashamed to admit how little I liked it. I am only about 50 pages in and since I haven't been able to finish a single paragraph without skimming I'm just going to stop reading it. Cosmos is written in a casual, simple style almost like a story. To me it was way too simple and slow paced. Most of the first three chapters cover simple world setup and astronomy that I had learned about in more depth elsewhere. The book feels outdated to me though the facts are all still correct - very similar to the tv show of the same name (which we tried to watch but gave up on). I can't recommend this. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' much more and I feel like they have a similar purpose. "
134,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6515529-waqas-mhd,4,wow TMI. literally too much info. i don't know if i got everything but i really enjoyed it.
135,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,4,"Wow, this is pretty good. I'd never read any Sagan before reading this, nor had I seen him on television. I profess to always having been some what Sagan-illiterate. After reading this, I see why he was such an iconic figure. He had a real gift for scientific communication. Cosmos is so lucid, and really does a great job of expressing the enormity of its subject matter.However, it is often outdated. The chapters on the history of astronomy (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, etc.) are likely to be timeless. Much of what is written about our own solar system is still (to the best of my knowledge) mostly accurate. Of course, Voyager had not yet reached Uranus when this was published, so there's very little on the ice giants, for example, and we knew much less about Mars than we do now (having since visited it with a rover). And our understanding of the life cycle of stars have also (in the big picture) not changed enormously since this book was written. However, our conception of deep space has changed substantially. This book was published before dark energy / dark matter became accepted and, as such, the discussion on the expansion of the universe and the composition of deep space is very obviously dated, even in much of its basics. The final chapter on avoiding the risk of nuclear war is also less prescient in our post-Cold War present.Nevertheless, I can't not recommend this book. Sagan is an awesome nonfiction writer, and no doubt inspired countless thousands of people to pursue astronomy and physics. This shouldn't be your only stop in exploring the mysteries of the universe beyond our earth, but even if it is - well, you could do much worse."
136,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"I've seen a few people in Internet forums over the years say if there's any religion they subscribe to, it's Saganism. Obviously, it's a clever turn of phrase, but it also speaks to the fact the cosmic, scientific truths Sagan conveys here really do activate the same neural pathways of more traditional sacred experience. It's hard to walk away from any page of this book without feeling an immense sense of awe at the natural world, reverence for the universe as a whole, and a deep ethical commitment to not screw up this incredible opportunity we've been given to exist on this planet in this universe. I'm eager to read his other stuff and watch the original series now. After years of hearing so much hype about Sagan's ability to clearly communicate the inspirational wonders of scientific discovery, I was so excited to find he not just met but exceeded my high expectations."
137,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214318-roddy,5,"Stunning, beautiful prose, excellent description and metaphor, incredibly accessible. Its also one of those books where you get to see the author's own genius slip into the pages accidentally, every so often. This book is the book A Brief History of Time wants to be. Problem is, ABHOT is much more boring and high concept. Sagan is and ever will be the great teacher of the masses in my opinion. This book starts out simpler than ABHOT - here on earth. It begins with what you know and slowly expands your circle of knowledge with insightful description and simile (""the dancing of electrons with their nuclear partners across the surface of ice is like..."") Once you've got your basics, he starts taking you through the process of thinking about how it all might fit together, what scientists are currently working on (were, then working on) and thinking about. I don't hesitate to loan this to my most unscientific minded friends because its actually a great way to get them to stop thinking that stars are made from the souls of people who have died and that people just appeared on the face of the earth fully formed and wearing neckties, some 4000 years ago. Cosmos is also a very holistic book, it discusses evolution, life, the beginnings of the universe the end of the universe, the possiblity of life on other planets - and, very convincingly suggests what that might look like. It at least drives home that we have to step away from the life we are familiar with when we start theorizing what life might be like elsewhere. I can't say enough about how great this book is, how well it imbues its reader with scientific mojo, and how a book that covers textbook type material manages to be so readable. There are also (especially in the hardcover) some very pretty pictures. Note: The book cosmos was a companion/derivative of the PBS special ""Cosmos"" which Sagan worked to explain the mysteries of the universe in something like 14 episodes. You can probably buy this online if you're one of those total lamos that prefers ""the movie"". However, this movie is actually pretty awesome, albeit with very old school animations. Also Note: This book was written in the 1970s. From an outsider's perspective, physics and astrophysics (which is technically more what Cosmos is about) don't change much in 30 years, but in fact they do. Many of the theories Sagan puts forth have since proven to be quite accurate, and some, have understandably proven to be not quite accurate. Not knowing which these are won't hurt the reader; just learning how he begins his process of hypothesizing, and the idea of thinking big picture and how it all fits together is the real lesson of Cosmos. You'll need a recent astronomy or astrophysics (basic) textbook to find the plot holes though, so the recreational reader should fear not. "
138,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5120947-haritha,5,"I cannot begin to describe how amazing this book is. Of all the books I have read in my life till now, I will always remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos as the book that brought back meaning into my life. With wonderful humility, Dr. Sagan makes the unfathomably huge Cosmos come to life. His words, clearly written from the heart, are complemented by beautiful photographs and illustrations. I cannot imagine any reader being unmoved by what Dr. Sagan is telling us. As I progressed through the thirteen chapters that make this book, I went through phases of awe about how big the known Universe is, how little we know, how insignificant we are in the Cosmic scale of things, hopelessness of how petty even the biggest and most serious of international arguments (forget the minutiae of daily petty fights and grudges) are, poignancy about lost knowledge and civilizations, before I realized truly what Dr. Sagan wishes to say- human life is so, so, so, very precious. In the deafening noise of various philosophies that concern the meaning of life, Dr. Sagan's voice is the soothing balm of reason to chaffed and tired ears. This lonely planet called Earth in a forgotten corner of the Universe desperately needs more people like Dr. Sagan who can write as eloquent a book as the Cosmos. I recommend this book to each and every one. If I have kids, this book will be one they will quote as the formative book of their childhood. Carl Sagan, we miss you and you will always be my hero. "
139,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,5,"It was absolutely a stunning experience, this book is a treasure, seriously a TREASURE! It has in it almost everything you'd want to know about our universe.I won't deny that I learned a lot, and slightly appeased my eager to science, Astronomy in particular.One thing that I'd like is having the show Cosmos produced again, it would be a great opportunity to introduce ""people"" into a world of wonders."
140,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,Even after all these years (I read it for the first time ten years ago) Cosmos is still of the best science books I've ever read. 
141,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Carl Sagan's boyish enthusiasm fills this book ranging widely on scientific topics while emphasizing his life-long passion for communication with other intelligence in the universe.Like Issac Asimov, Sagan is captivated by the wonder of our physical world and eager to explain it to the general public, though Sagan ventures more into speculation while Asimov is more detail oriented - not only wanting you to know about the atom, but about the parts and the forces involved, never departing from the facts.It's impossible to read this book without finding out new things, even though it was written almost 30 years ago. For example, I did not know that our sun was formed in the company of other stars that have since dispersed across the galaxy, nor did I know that the spiral arms of our Milky Way are areas of star formation that move independently of the stars they move through. Ten million years ago the earth was within one of these spiral arms, now it is on the edge.In Cosmos, Sagan moves out from the Sun as he also takes us forward from the dawn of science. Since I've read quite a bit about the history of scientific discovery, I found the first part of this book, dealing with that subject, far less interesting than the last third where Sagan takes us off into the vastness of space, ponders the chances of life on other worlds, informs us of the weirdness of black holes, describes the life of stars and explains the possibility of another dimension that we cannot experience. He addresses the reader with respect. You feel like you are in the company of a good friend who responds to something you say with, ""yeah, I've wondered about that too and here's what I think.""Sagan has a marvelous capacity to take a subject just so far without getting bogged down in detail. There were several times I became engaged in his topic and he would carry it forward far enough for my curiosity to be satisfied. I never had that disappointing feeling of the child who says to the storytelling parent, ""but THEN what happened!?"" only to be told the story is over.The style of writing is free-flowing and natural. I don't know that I've ever sped through a book like I did this one, quickly grasping what the author has to say. There is a special kind of genius in being able to take the most abstruse subjects and present them in an understandable way. Carl Sagan writes like he was born with a pen in his hand. At the same time, his imagination is so fertile that you never can tell where he will go with a subject. His speculations about contact with another intelligence in the universe are broad and deep, this obviously being where is heart is.After closing the book, I'm impressed by how microscopic humanity is in the vastness of space and how recent we are in the immensity of time. We've only had radio for 100 years, so our electromagnetic voice has reached only 100 light years from earth, enough to get to the nearest few dozen stars, yet we are aware of, able to see through optical or radio astronomy, objects that are billions of light years from us, dating to not long after the origin of the universe.The question that hangs over this book is - are we alone? Over the billions of stars that are out there, why is there no evidence at all of intelligence elsewhere?I'm tempted to get the e-reader version of this book simply to be able to look things up easily in the future. Sagan answers so many questions, it will be easy for me to forget the answers."
142,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72985691-osama-siddique,5,"What can one say about Sagan and Cosmos that hasn't already been said. Of course I keenly devoured the show, I did have very early and deep fascination for the heavens above, and I have zealously read this one quite a few times. What Sagan has is this unique and very rare ability not just to make complex things simple, or to really bring forth and radiate the sense of awe evoked by the scale and nature of the cosmos, or a vital sense of timing and drama - of course he had all that and he was a superb scientist, teacher, presenter, actor and dramatist all rolled in one - but the unique and rare ability I want to highlight is to retain and flamboyantly convey the same deep and abiding sense of wonder, joy and excitement in the reader or the viewer as he probably felt himself the very first time he started looking for patterns in the stars. Give this book to every child, every dreamer, every would be scientist, every poet and anyone with a questioning mind. Give it also to the myopic, the dullard, the accountant and the bore. For who knows it may cure all of them. It rolls out a cosmic tapestry woven out of stars - the stuff of dreams, awe and imagination - with a master conductor and choreographer explaining the melody and rhythm of our universe. This is one of those books that you sometimes hope you had not read. Simply so that you can rediscover it and reread it and relive the thrill. Hope you are voyaging happily somewhere amongst the stars Carl. "
143,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I don't get people who find this too dry, or lacking in a sense of wonder about the world. It's full of a sense of wonder, no less potent because Sagan was agnostic (not atheist, as some people say), and he expresses this almost poetically. While some of the science is falling out of date now, it's still worth reading Cosmos -- as a primer, and for Sagan's clear explanations of how the world works, and how our understanding got to this point.I actually have the DVDs of the series as well, and while I know from seeing clips the book and the series are very similar, I'm gonna have to get round to seeing it soon. And if you've never heard of Symphony of Science, I definitely recommend it -- my favourite is 'A Glorious Dawn'.One of the things reading this really made me wonder is what Sagan would think of what we've made of the world in the last two decades. We haven't destroyed ourselves yet, but we haven't yet disarmed, we haven't even convinced everybody that climate change exists, and we still haven't gone any further from our own small planet. I wish we still had Sagan, speaking clearly and rationally about all the problems we face -- particularly because he had hope for us, as well as a warning."

I think the reason I am interested in subjects such as classics and anthropology can be traced to this book! It's a very broad look at the history of the universe and the history of science, so even though it is a good 20+ years old, most of it still stands. Sagan writes in an engaging and accessible manner. This is definitely a great book for people who are interested in science, but a little afraid to approach a book about it. Sagan looks at the universe with awe and wonder, and he conveys these feelings to the reader."

The only ones I do keep are the ones I know I am going to read again, and this is my third time reading this.As general books about physics go, this is the best one I've ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.The subject might not appeal to a lot of people, but if you want an introduction to the cosmos, the universe, and our planet's place in it, and you don't mind having your mind opened a little bit, then I completely recommend this bookIt's going to stay on my shelf forever (or, more accurately, til the day I die)"
146,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4902544-katie,4,"I love Carl Sagan. He really does make you feel like a kid again. His excitement and enthusiasm come through clearly right from the start of this book and I'd think it would be hard for anyone not to get swept up by it. The facts and mysteries of the cosmos are fascinating especially when Carl Sagan is talking about them. There are inevitably some dry and drawn out parts,being the reason for 4 stars, but all in all fantastic. "

It leaves you somewhat different, somewhat better of a person than you were before. But rarely, very rarely, a book fundamentally alters your outlook on life and the world around you. Cosmos is such a book.Us human beings have a tendency to become complacent and indifferent as we get trapped in the humdrum rhythm of life on earth. Our minds occupied by mundane, pressing issues, we tend to forget the absurd immensity of it the cosmos - both in space and in time. This book wakes you from that slumber and takes you on a voyage from the very beginning of time to now, from the microcosm of what makes up everything to the macrocosm of everything that is. It makes you realize just how puny and insignificant, yet how remarkably special we are. We are, in Sagan's words, “starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms”Our future depends on this realization. It depends on whether we will be able to avoid self-destructing before we set on daring voyages beyond our lonely solar system. Cosmos is a book that must be read and reread, because its lessons are ones we cannot afford to forget."

“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”
Remarkable, strong, well crafted, Cosmos as far as I am concerned is a masterpiece of popular science.Carl Sagan is now one of my favorite authors and a person I greatly admire. You can see plainly how much effort was put into this book, and how genuine it is. To put it simply, he is a great writer and a great person.This book was meant as a companion to the TV show Cosmos (1980), a masterpiece on its own accord, I advise going over the two together and following up with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.As to the contents of this book, it is fair to say this book encompasses a great deal of information ranging between science and history, I guess I would call it a history of science, but it also touches on many other fields such as civilization, philosophy, and religion.The scientific fields the book goes through are many, but the main focus is, of course, astronomy.However, I would not recommend this book for its scientific content, as a lot has changed since 1980, almost 40 years now. Not that what we knew back then is now irrelevant, just less relevant as new information go piled on top of it.I recommend reading this book for several reasons. Sagan himself as one, I believe everyone should get acquainted with the men, what way would be better than hearing his words? Two, this book serves as a near-perfect gateway for astronomy and science in general, a kind of why you should care answer. Three, the historical view and perspective over the development of science are very enlightening, one can never know enough of one's own species. Four, a vision of where we are, how we came to be, and where we are going.I am pretty sure there is more, that was just off the top of my head.What I might criticize about this book is some repetitions, it made this feel less like a book and more like speech, and also like Sagan was trying to sell something, his points about extraterrestrial life and views on religion to be specific. Also, this is not exactly a very scientific book, nor an objective historical account, but that may not be a concern as it is not sold as one or the other. Arguably, if it was one of those it would not have been as beautiful and attractive. It would not have achieved as wide as an impact as it had. The emotion is a great part of why this book is so valuable.I recommend this book, for fun, for knowledge, for humanity.“What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.”“The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”"
152,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,This book and series sparked my interest in science and the universe in 1980 when I was thirteen. It is not cutting edge today but the poetry and wonder of Carl Sagan's vision still is current. Reading this book 36 years after the series reminds me of how science and a vision of universe can inspire people long after the science of the book has been surpassed. Beautiful book.

154,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"Five huge stars for this remarkable book. I've added it to my ""books everyone should read"" shelf. The Cosmos is us. It is us understanding, getting to know who we really are. So many questions are still out there, but we, the people in our wonderful and unique planet, have been able to wonder, search, and find answers always closer to the truth thanks to science.Life is so wonderful and rare, and I'm so happy my life took place in this period of time when we have been able to inherit the science and knowledge of so many generations of people and such brilliant minds as Erathostenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, and so many others. I have to make a special mention of Christian Huygens, a brilliant man I barely knew about. I definitely want to read much more about him. Also Hipatia, the last guardian of the library of Alexandria. I experienced once more the pity and overwhelming sorrow for such terrible loss. Well, in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about the path of science from the beginning, when men began to wonder, question, and learn to have a conscience of our existence and who we are up to this point when we have developed technology that allows us to keep learning about other places in our Universe beyond the only place we have ever known and where everything has ever happened to each person that has ever existed: our Earth. My final feeling is still this great awe about us, about every form of life that we see as normal and common. I share Sagan's thoughts about how pointless wars are, and hope that we can survive past them and humanity can finally learn to live only to build and perpetuate life in all its forms. If you haven't read this book yet, read it. For me it's one of those ""must""."
155,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44347175-rashit,4,"Carl Sagan presents us with a journey from the Library of Alexandria to the void of the universe. This journey is mostly a scientific journey. From time to time, non-scientific elements become part of this journey. So the book doesn't contain very heavy information. Anyway, Sagan's tongue quite understandable. That's the most powerful side of the book. On the other hand, due to science is constantly improving, some information isn't up to date. He updates some information in Cosmos's documentary. That information will be insufficient over time. Although he protects his objectivity in the whole book, he loses his objectivity in a few places. The reason is the western admiration. He says that in the development of scientific civilization, the weight of west is. This attitude isn’t scientific. Because the basis of today's science occurs works which done in the Library of Alexandria period (Sagan also agrees). After the library was burned, burned books haven’t reached today (He agrees again). It isn't known most of those books of their titles and their writers (He continues to agree). Well, if there are many writers from that library that we don't know, how can we talk so confidently about the fact that science is based on the west?"

“Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life—moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.”
Cosmos contained a great deal of information, much of which was engaging. The subject matter included: a history of humanity’s quest for understanding and notable scientific discoveries, evolution and genetics, some basic chemistry and physics (including a brief description of relativity), and, of course, astronomy. The following are some of the astronomy topics covered: the Big Bang, the life cycles of stars, details about many of our solar system’s planets and their satellites, information on a few NASA space missions, and speculation about intelligent alien life.Overall, while Cosmos was a very comprehensive summary of many different branches of knowledge, I really didn’t care for Sagan’s writing style. The first issue I had with his style is that he was often overly lyrical/mystical in tone. The text was abundantly peppered with phrases such as “the bastion and the citadel of the stars.” In my opinion, science and math are beautiful just as they are, and so dressing them up in flowery language is overkill, and can even be counterproductive. An example of this type of thing occurred when Sagan discussed nuclear fusion in stars, and where heavier chemical elements come from. This is a truly fascinating process. But then Sagan goes on to state that: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” I’m assuming he included that last sentence because he wanted readers to feel pretty pleased with ourselves…we’re all literally made out of stars! Far out! How cool are we? But if you think about it, excrement can lay claim to the same stellar forebears, which somewhat diminishes that beautiful, lofty sentiment we’re (presumably) supposed to be feeling about ourselves.My other issue with the writing is that, when it was not waxing poetic, it tended to be far too dumbed down. True, he was trying to reach a very large audience, many of whom have no background in science. That said, it would have been nice to read a book written for grown-ups.Overall, the book was just okay for me. Maybe it’s more exciting to those who haven’t taken an Intro to Astronomy course. If you’ve already studied Astronomy 101, however, there is nothing in either the writing or the personal opinions presented herein that qualify this as a must-read book."
157,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,5,"We humans have come a long way. From the days we were wandering the planet looking little different from our primate cousins, to these modern times where we take for granted technologies that would have been equated to magic just a century or so ago, we humans have made amazing progress. Science is what brought us here and science is what is going to help us evolve in the days ahead too. Science helped us see things as they are, dispelled our fears, gave us hope, made us discover fire and invent the wheel – two of the most important findings till today. While science may not have solved all our queries yet - and raises as many demons as it lays to rest - it makes genuine, continuous efforts to arrive at the Truth. Armed with science, we humans have started exploring all around us. From the microcosmic wonders of atoms to the mega marvels of Universe, science has lifted many veils and shown us things beyond our limited understanding. Scientists like Carl Sagan have played an important role in lifting those veils, not only by their direct contribution to the sciences, but also through their ability to communicate such esoteric wisdom to the masses, to laymen that are keen on understanding their surroundings but limited in their ability to do so.Books like ‘The Origin of Species’ remain special, not just because they tell us about groundbreaking discoveries, but also due to their telling it in a language that we, the laypersons, can understand. While ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan may not be as earth-shattering as ‘The Origin of Species’, it is special by its own right. Written nearly four decades ago, co-developed with a television series of the same name, this book was produced with the idea of popularizing the sciences, especially astronomy, among the masses. To the uninitiated but curious mind, this book is the ideal beginning into the wonderous realms of the cosmos. This book is to the budding astronomer what the alphabets and the arithmetic are to the young child.From the ancient budding of scientific thoughts at the Ionian islands to the then-latest launching of space missions like Voyager-2, Carl Sagan takes each stage in the evolution of science as we know it, elaborates on the circumstances prevailing at those times, enumerates important contributions by various scientists. The real fun is his doing all this in an interesting, pacey manner, without letting the reader feel bored even once. After helping us navigate the unimaginably vast expanse of our Universe and showing us the wonders of our solar system, stars, planets, galaxies and the bleak black holes along the way, Sagan ends the book with philosophical musings on the future of mankind on this nuclear era and the possibilities of our encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.This is not just a book on astronomy. Burgeoning with interesting details on history, evolution, atomic science and mathematics, this is one complete book that every mind passionate about learning must possess."

162,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365191-daniel,5,"I went into this book hoping to learn more about the Universe, and learn more I did. The chapters that dealt with star and galaxy formations were excellent, and many times I put down the book to look up something online. I had heard about a number of these topics in passing, and it was nice to read about them with more depth. For some reason, I was entranced by the concept of the 'heliopause' (look it up: it's freaking amazing), while I was outright blown away by the fact that both Voyager satellites are only a few years away from reaching this threshold of our solar system. In one of these searches, I discovered that you can subscribe to a Twitter feed for Voyager 2 that states (from a first-person POV, as if V2 is talking to you; nice) how far the satellite has traveled. According to a tweet that is one hour old (at 21:47 EST on 7/15/12), Voyager 2 was 13 hrs, 36 mins, and 44 seconds of light-travel time from Earth.One word: geekgasm.I enjoyed the historical passages, though I once again felt a massive need to branch out beyond the usual coterie of Greeks and Europeans. Sagan makes a passing reference to this cultural bias in his last chapter, stating that ""the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western Civilization"" (281). I want to contest this statement, and the fact that I feel ill-educated to do so is evidence that I have read far more about these portions of history than any other.Sagan includes passionate passages that touch upon our birthright as a species that, ultimately, comes from ""starstuff."" Though I have heard this idea before, Sagan writes about it with a conviction that snared my sympathies anew. His point is just as poignant today as it was 32 (damn) years ago: our specie's propensity for killing each other is frightening and tragic, and the billions of dollars that governments devote to this enterprise only divert our attention and energy from pursuits that could sustain humanity on this planet, if not propel it well beyond our own stellar backyard.This book awakened another perturbing thought: I should have read about this decades ago and read further thereafter. Better now, I suppose, than never."
163,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074534-emily,1,"I have heard great things about this book and Carl Sagan for so long that I am ashamed to admit how little I liked it. I am only about 50 pages in and since I haven't been able to finish a single paragraph without skimming I'm just going to stop reading it. Cosmos is written in a casual, simple style almost like a story. To me it was way too simple and slow paced. Most of the first three chapters cover simple world setup and astronomy that I had learned about in more depth elsewhere. The book feels outdated to me though the facts are all still correct - very similar to the tv show of the same name (which we tried to watch but gave up on). I can't recommend this. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' much more and I feel like they have a similar purpose. "
164,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6515529-waqas-mhd,4,wow TMI. literally too much info. i don't know if i got everything but i really enjoyed it.
165,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,4,"Wow, this is pretty good. I'd never read any Sagan before reading this, nor had I seen him on television. I profess to always having been some what Sagan-illiterate. After reading this, I see why he was such an iconic figure. He had a real gift for scientific communication. Cosmos is so lucid, and really does a great job of expressing the enormity of its subject matter.However, it is often outdated. The chapters on the history of astronomy (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, etc.) are likely to be timeless. Much of what is written about our own solar system is still (to the best of my knowledge) mostly accurate. Of course, Voyager had not yet reached Uranus when this was published, so there's very little on the ice giants, for example, and we knew much less about Mars than we do now (having since visited it with a rover). And our understanding of the life cycle of stars have also (in the big picture) not changed enormously since this book was written. However, our conception of deep space has changed substantially. This book was published before dark energy / dark matter became accepted and, as such, the discussion on the expansion of the universe and the composition of deep space is very obviously dated, even in much of its basics. The final chapter on avoiding the risk of nuclear war is also less prescient in our post-Cold War present.Nevertheless, I can't not recommend this book. Sagan is an awesome nonfiction writer, and no doubt inspired countless thousands of people to pursue astronomy and physics. This shouldn't be your only stop in exploring the mysteries of the universe beyond our earth, but even if it is - well, you could do much worse."
166,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"I've seen a few people in Internet forums over the years say if there's any religion they subscribe to, it's Saganism. Obviously, it's a clever turn of phrase, but it also speaks to the fact the cosmic, scientific truths Sagan conveys here really do activate the same neural pathways of more traditional sacred experience. It's hard to walk away from any page of this book without feeling an immense sense of awe at the natural world, reverence for the universe as a whole, and a deep ethical commitment to not screw up this incredible opportunity we've been given to exist on this planet in this universe. I'm eager to read his other stuff and watch the original series now. After years of hearing so much hype about Sagan's ability to clearly communicate the inspirational wonders of scientific discovery, I was so excited to find he not just met but exceeded my high expectations."
167,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214318-roddy,5,"Stunning, beautiful prose, excellent description and metaphor, incredibly accessible. Its also one of those books where you get to see the author's own genius slip into the pages accidentally, every so often. This book is the book A Brief History of Time wants to be. Problem is, ABHOT is much more boring and high concept. Sagan is and ever will be the great teacher of the masses in my opinion. This book starts out simpler than ABHOT - here on earth. It begins with what you know and slowly expands your circle of knowledge with insightful description and simile (""the dancing of electrons with their nuclear partners across the surface of ice is like..."") Once you've got your basics, he starts taking you through the process of thinking about how it all might fit together, what scientists are currently working on (were, then working on) and thinking about. I don't hesitate to loan this to my most unscientific minded friends because its actually a great way to get them to stop thinking that stars are made from the souls of people who have died and that people just appeared on the face of the earth fully formed and wearing neckties, some 4000 years ago. Cosmos is also a very holistic book, it discusses evolution, life, the beginnings of the universe the end of the universe, the possiblity of life on other planets - and, very convincingly suggests what that might look like. It at least drives home that we have to step away from the life we are familiar with when we start theorizing what life might be like elsewhere. I can't say enough about how great this book is, how well it imbues its reader with scientific mojo, and how a book that covers textbook type material manages to be so readable. There are also (especially in the hardcover) some very pretty pictures. Note: The book cosmos was a companion/derivative of the PBS special ""Cosmos"" which Sagan worked to explain the mysteries of the universe in something like 14 episodes. You can probably buy this online if you're one of those total lamos that prefers ""the movie"". However, this movie is actually pretty awesome, albeit with very old school animations. Also Note: This book was written in the 1970s. From an outsider's perspective, physics and astrophysics (which is technically more what Cosmos is about) don't change much in 30 years, but in fact they do. Many of the theories Sagan puts forth have since proven to be quite accurate, and some, have understandably proven to be not quite accurate. Not knowing which these are won't hurt the reader; just learning how he begins his process of hypothesizing, and the idea of thinking big picture and how it all fits together is the real lesson of Cosmos. You'll need a recent astronomy or astrophysics (basic) textbook to find the plot holes though, so the recreational reader should fear not. "
168,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5120947-haritha,5,"I cannot begin to describe how amazing this book is. Of all the books I have read in my life till now, I will always remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos as the book that brought back meaning into my life. With wonderful humility, Dr. Sagan makes the unfathomably huge Cosmos come to life. His words, clearly written from the heart, are complemented by beautiful photographs and illustrations. I cannot imagine any reader being unmoved by what Dr. Sagan is telling us. As I progressed through the thirteen chapters that make this book, I went through phases of awe about how big the known Universe is, how little we know, how insignificant we are in the Cosmic scale of things, hopelessness of how petty even the biggest and most serious of international arguments (forget the minutiae of daily petty fights and grudges) are, poignancy about lost knowledge and civilizations, before I realized truly what Dr. Sagan wishes to say- human life is so, so, so, very precious. In the deafening noise of various philosophies that concern the meaning of life, Dr. Sagan's voice is the soothing balm of reason to chaffed and tired ears. This lonely planet called Earth in a forgotten corner of the Universe desperately needs more people like Dr. Sagan who can write as eloquent a book as the Cosmos. I recommend this book to each and every one. If I have kids, this book will be one they will quote as the formative book of their childhood. Carl Sagan, we miss you and you will always be my hero. "
169,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,5,"It was absolutely a stunning experience, this book is a treasure, seriously a TREASURE! It has in it almost everything you'd want to know about our universe.I won't deny that I learned a lot, and slightly appeased my eager to science, Astronomy in particular.One thing that I'd like is having the show Cosmos produced again, it would be a great opportunity to introduce ""people"" into a world of wonders."
170,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,Even after all these years (I read it for the first time ten years ago) Cosmos is still of the best science books I've ever read. 
171,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Carl Sagan's boyish enthusiasm fills this book ranging widely on scientific topics while emphasizing his life-long passion for communication with other intelligence in the universe.Like Issac Asimov, Sagan is captivated by the wonder of our physical world and eager to explain it to the general public, though Sagan ventures more into speculation while Asimov is more detail oriented - not only wanting you to know about the atom, but about the parts and the forces involved, never departing from the facts.It's impossible to read this book without finding out new things, even though it was written almost 30 years ago. For example, I did not know that our sun was formed in the company of other stars that have since dispersed across the galaxy, nor did I know that the spiral arms of our Milky Way are areas of star formation that move independently of the stars they move through. Ten million years ago the earth was within one of these spiral arms, now it is on the edge.In Cosmos, Sagan moves out from the Sun as he also takes us forward from the dawn of science. Since I've read quite a bit about the history of scientific discovery, I found the first part of this book, dealing with that subject, far less interesting than the last third where Sagan takes us off into the vastness of space, ponders the chances of life on other worlds, informs us of the weirdness of black holes, describes the life of stars and explains the possibility of another dimension that we cannot experience. He addresses the reader with respect. You feel like you are in the company of a good friend who responds to something you say with, ""yeah, I've wondered about that too and here's what I think.""Sagan has a marvelous capacity to take a subject just so far without getting bogged down in detail. There were several times I became engaged in his topic and he would carry it forward far enough for my curiosity to be satisfied. I never had that disappointing feeling of the child who says to the storytelling parent, ""but THEN what happened!?"" only to be told the story is over.The style of writing is free-flowing and natural. I don't know that I've ever sped through a book like I did this one, quickly grasping what the author has to say. There is a special kind of genius in being able to take the most abstruse subjects and present them in an understandable way. Carl Sagan writes like he was born with a pen in his hand. At the same time, his imagination is so fertile that you never can tell where he will go with a subject. His speculations about contact with another intelligence in the universe are broad and deep, this obviously being where is heart is.After closing the book, I'm impressed by how microscopic humanity is in the vastness of space and how recent we are in the immensity of time. We've only had radio for 100 years, so our electromagnetic voice has reached only 100 light years from earth, enough to get to the nearest few dozen stars, yet we are aware of, able to see through optical or radio astronomy, objects that are billions of light years from us, dating to not long after the origin of the universe.The question that hangs over this book is - are we alone? Over the billions of stars that are out there, why is there no evidence at all of intelligence elsewhere?I'm tempted to get the e-reader version of this book simply to be able to look things up easily in the future. Sagan answers so many questions, it will be easy for me to forget the answers."
172,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72985691-osama-siddique,5,"What can one say about Sagan and Cosmos that hasn't already been said. Of course I keenly devoured the show, I did have very early and deep fascination for the heavens above, and I have zealously read this one quite a few times. What Sagan has is this unique and very rare ability not just to make complex things simple, or to really bring forth and radiate the sense of awe evoked by the scale and nature of the cosmos, or a vital sense of timing and drama - of course he had all that and he was a superb scientist, teacher, presenter, actor and dramatist all rolled in one - but the unique and rare ability I want to highlight is to retain and flamboyantly convey the same deep and abiding sense of wonder, joy and excitement in the reader or the viewer as he probably felt himself the very first time he started looking for patterns in the stars. Give this book to every child, every dreamer, every would be scientist, every poet and anyone with a questioning mind. Give it also to the myopic, the dullard, the accountant and the bore. For who knows it may cure all of them. It rolls out a cosmic tapestry woven out of stars - the stuff of dreams, awe and imagination - with a master conductor and choreographer explaining the melody and rhythm of our universe. This is one of those books that you sometimes hope you had not read. Simply so that you can rediscover it and reread it and relive the thrill. Hope you are voyaging happily somewhere amongst the stars Carl. "
173,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I don't get people who find this too dry, or lacking in a sense of wonder about the world. It's full of a sense of wonder, no less potent because Sagan was agnostic (not atheist, as some people say), and he expresses this almost poetically. While some of the science is falling out of date now, it's still worth reading Cosmos -- as a primer, and for Sagan's clear explanations of how the world works, and how our understanding got to this point.I actually have the DVDs of the series as well, and while I know from seeing clips the book and the series are very similar, I'm gonna have to get round to seeing it soon. And if you've never heard of Symphony of Science, I definitely recommend it -- my favourite is 'A Glorious Dawn'.One of the things reading this really made me wonder is what Sagan would think of what we've made of the world in the last two decades. We haven't destroyed ourselves yet, but we haven't yet disarmed, we haven't even convinced everybody that climate change exists, and we still haven't gone any further from our own small planet. I wish we still had Sagan, speaking clearly and rationally about all the problems we face -- particularly because he had hope for us, as well as a warning."
174,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84821-amy,5,"I think I could categorize this book as ""life-changing"" for me. I think the reason I am interested in subjects such as classics and anthropology can be traced to this book! It's a very broad look at the history of the universe and the history of science, so even though it is a good 20+ years old, most of it still stands. Sagan writes in an engaging and accessible manner. This is definitely a great book for people who are interested in science, but a little afraid to approach a book about it. Sagan looks at the universe with awe and wonder, and he conveys these feelings to the reader."

The only ones I do keep are the ones I know I am going to read again, and this is my third time reading this.As general books about physics go, this is the best one I've ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.The subject might not appeal to a lot of people, but if you want an introduction to the cosmos, the universe, and our planet's place in it, and you don't mind having your mind opened a little bit, then I completely recommend this bookIt's going to stay on my shelf forever (or, more accurately, til the day I die)"
176,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4902544-katie,4,"I love Carl Sagan. He really does make you feel like a kid again. His excitement and enthusiasm come through clearly right from the start of this book and I'd think it would be hard for anyone not to get swept up by it. The facts and mysteries of the cosmos are fascinating especially when Carl Sagan is talking about them. There are inevitably some dry and drawn out parts,being the reason for 4 stars, but all in all fantastic. "

It leaves you somewhat different, somewhat better of a person than you were before. But rarely, very rarely, a book fundamentally alters your outlook on life and the world around you. Cosmos is such a book.Us human beings have a tendency to become complacent and indifferent as we get trapped in the humdrum rhythm of life on earth. Our minds occupied by mundane, pressing issues, we tend to forget the absurd immensity of it the cosmos - both in space and in time. This book wakes you from that slumber and takes you on a voyage from the very beginning of time to now, from the microcosm of what makes up everything to the macrocosm of everything that is. It makes you realize just how puny and insignificant, yet how remarkably special we are. We are, in Sagan's words, “starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms”Our future depends on this realization. It depends on whether we will be able to avoid self-destructing before we set on daring voyages beyond our lonely solar system. Cosmos is a book that must be read and reread, because its lessons are ones we cannot afford to forget."

“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”
Remarkable, strong, well crafted, Cosmos as far as I am concerned is a masterpiece of popular science.Carl Sagan is now one of my favorite authors and a person I greatly admire. You can see plainly how much effort was put into this book, and how genuine it is. To put it simply, he is a great writer and a great person.This book was meant as a companion to the TV show Cosmos (1980), a masterpiece on its own accord, I advise going over the two together and following up with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.As to the contents of this book, it is fair to say this book encompasses a great deal of information ranging between science and history, I guess I would call it a history of science, but it also touches on many other fields such as civilization, philosophy, and religion.The scientific fields the book goes through are many, but the main focus is, of course, astronomy.However, I would not recommend this book for its scientific content, as a lot has changed since 1980, almost 40 years now. Not that what we knew back then is now irrelevant, just less relevant as new information go piled on top of it.I recommend reading this book for several reasons. Sagan himself as one, I believe everyone should get acquainted with the men, what way would be better than hearing his words? Two, this book serves as a near-perfect gateway for astronomy and science in general, a kind of why you should care answer. Three, the historical view and perspective over the development of science are very enlightening, one can never know enough of one's own species. Four, a vision of where we are, how we came to be, and where we are going.I am pretty sure there is more, that was just off the top of my head.What I might criticize about this book is some repetitions, it made this feel less like a book and more like speech, and also like Sagan was trying to sell something, his points about extraterrestrial life and views on religion to be specific. Also, this is not exactly a very scientific book, nor an objective historical account, but that may not be a concern as it is not sold as one or the other. Arguably, if it was one of those it would not have been as beautiful and attractive. It would not have achieved as wide as an impact as it had. The emotion is a great part of why this book is so valuable.I recommend this book, for fun, for knowledge, for humanity.“What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.”“The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”"
182,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,This book and series sparked my interest in science and the universe in 1980 when I was thirteen. It is not cutting edge today but the poetry and wonder of Carl Sagan's vision still is current. Reading this book 36 years after the series reminds me of how science and a vision of universe can inspire people long after the science of the book has been surpassed. Beautiful book.

184,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"Five huge stars for this remarkable book. I've added it to my ""books everyone should read"" shelf. The Cosmos is us. It is us understanding, getting to know who we really are. So many questions are still out there, but we, the people in our wonderful and unique planet, have been able to wonder, search, and find answers always closer to the truth thanks to science.Life is so wonderful and rare, and I'm so happy my life took place in this period of time when we have been able to inherit the science and knowledge of so many generations of people and such brilliant minds as Erathostenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, and so many others. I have to make a special mention of Christian Huygens, a brilliant man I barely knew about. I definitely want to read much more about him. Also Hipatia, the last guardian of the library of Alexandria. I experienced once more the pity and overwhelming sorrow for such terrible loss. Well, in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about the path of science from the beginning, when men began to wonder, question, and learn to have a conscience of our existence and who we are up to this point when we have developed technology that allows us to keep learning about other places in our Universe beyond the only place we have ever known and where everything has ever happened to each person that has ever existed: our Earth. My final feeling is still this great awe about us, about every form of life that we see as normal and common. I share Sagan's thoughts about how pointless wars are, and hope that we can survive past them and humanity can finally learn to live only to build and perpetuate life in all its forms. If you haven't read this book yet, read it. For me it's one of those ""must""."
185,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44347175-rashit,4,"Carl Sagan presents us with a journey from the Library of Alexandria to the void of the universe. This journey is mostly a scientific journey. From time to time, non-scientific elements become part of this journey. So the book doesn't contain very heavy information. Anyway, Sagan's tongue quite understandable. That's the most powerful side of the book. On the other hand, due to science is constantly improving, some information isn't up to date. He updates some information in Cosmos's documentary. That information will be insufficient over time. Although he protects his objectivity in the whole book, he loses his objectivity in a few places. The reason is the western admiration. He says that in the development of scientific civilization, the weight of west is. This attitude isn’t scientific. Because the basis of today's science occurs works which done in the Library of Alexandria period (Sagan also agrees). After the library was burned, burned books haven’t reached today (He agrees again). It isn't known most of those books of their titles and their writers (He continues to agree). Well, if there are many writers from that library that we don't know, how can we talk so confidently about the fact that science is based on the west?"

“Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life—moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.”
Cosmos contained a great deal of information, much of which was engaging. The subject matter included: a history of humanity’s quest for understanding and notable scientific discoveries, evolution and genetics, some basic chemistry and physics (including a brief description of relativity), and, of course, astronomy. The following are some of the astronomy topics covered: the Big Bang, the life cycles of stars, details about many of our solar system’s planets and their satellites, information on a few NASA space missions, and speculation about intelligent alien life.Overall, while Cosmos was a very comprehensive summary of many different branches of knowledge, I really didn’t care for Sagan’s writing style. The first issue I had with his style is that he was often overly lyrical/mystical in tone. The text was abundantly peppered with phrases such as “the bastion and the citadel of the stars.” In my opinion, science and math are beautiful just as they are, and so dressing them up in flowery language is overkill, and can even be counterproductive. An example of this type of thing occurred when Sagan discussed nuclear fusion in stars, and where heavier chemical elements come from. This is a truly fascinating process. But then Sagan goes on to state that: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” I’m assuming he included that last sentence because he wanted readers to feel pretty pleased with ourselves…we’re all literally made out of stars! Far out! How cool are we? But if you think about it, excrement can lay claim to the same stellar forebears, which somewhat diminishes that beautiful, lofty sentiment we’re (presumably) supposed to be feeling about ourselves.My other issue with the writing is that, when it was not waxing poetic, it tended to be far too dumbed down. True, he was trying to reach a very large audience, many of whom have no background in science. That said, it would have been nice to read a book written for grown-ups.Overall, the book was just okay for me. Maybe it’s more exciting to those who haven’t taken an Intro to Astronomy course. If you’ve already studied Astronomy 101, however, there is nothing in either the writing or the personal opinions presented herein that qualify this as a must-read book."

From the days we were wandering the planet looking little different from our primate cousins, to these modern times where we take for granted technologies that would have been equated to magic just a century or so ago, we humans have made amazing progress. Science is what brought us here and science is what is going to help us evolve in the days ahead too. Science helped us see things as they are, dispelled our fears, gave us hope, made us discover fire and invent the wheel – two of the most important findings till today. While science may not have solved all our queries yet - and raises as many demons as it lays to rest - it makes genuine, continuous efforts to arrive at the Truth. Armed with science, we humans have started exploring all around us. From the microcosmic wonders of atoms to the mega marvels of Universe, science has lifted many veils and shown us things beyond our limited understanding. Scientists like Carl Sagan have played an important role in lifting those veils, not only by their direct contribution to the sciences, but also through their ability to communicate such esoteric wisdom to the masses, to laymen that are keen on understanding their surroundings but limited in their ability to do so.Books like ‘The Origin of Species’ remain special, not just because they tell us about groundbreaking discoveries, but also due to their telling it in a language that we, the laypersons, can understand. While ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan may not be as earth-shattering as ‘The Origin of Species’, it is special by its own right. Written nearly four decades ago, co-developed with a television series of the same name, this book was produced with the idea of popularizing the sciences, especially astronomy, among the masses. To the uninitiated but curious mind, this book is the ideal beginning into the wonderous realms of the cosmos. This book is to the budding astronomer what the alphabets and the arithmetic are to the young child.From the ancient budding of scientific thoughts at the Ionian islands to the then-latest launching of space missions like Voyager-2, Carl Sagan takes each stage in the evolution of science as we know it, elaborates on the circumstances prevailing at those times, enumerates important contributions by various scientists. The real fun is his doing all this in an interesting, pacey manner, without letting the reader feel bored even once. After helping us navigate the unimaginably vast expanse of our Universe and showing us the wonders of our solar system, stars, planets, galaxies and the bleak black holes along the way, Sagan ends the book with philosophical musings on the future of mankind on this nuclear era and the possibilities of our encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.This is not just a book on astronomy. Burgeoning with interesting details on history, evolution, atomic science and mathematics, this is one complete book that every mind passionate about learning must possess."

192,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365191-daniel,5,"I went into this book hoping to learn more about the Universe, and learn more I did. The chapters that dealt with star and galaxy formations were excellent, and many times I put down the book to look up something online. I had heard about a number of these topics in passing, and it was nice to read about them with more depth. For some reason, I was entranced by the concept of the 'heliopause' (look it up: it's freaking amazing), while I was outright blown away by the fact that both Voyager satellites are only a few years away from reaching this threshold of our solar system. In one of these searches, I discovered that you can subscribe to a Twitter feed for Voyager 2 that states (from a first-person POV, as if V2 is talking to you; nice) how far the satellite has traveled. According to a tweet that is one hour old (at 21:47 EST on 7/15/12), Voyager 2 was 13 hrs, 36 mins, and 44 seconds of light-travel time from Earth.One word: geekgasm.I enjoyed the historical passages, though I once again felt a massive need to branch out beyond the usual coterie of Greeks and Europeans. Sagan makes a passing reference to this cultural bias in his last chapter, stating that ""the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western Civilization"" (281). I want to contest this statement, and the fact that I feel ill-educated to do so is evidence that I have read far more about these portions of history than any other.Sagan includes passionate passages that touch upon our birthright as a species that, ultimately, comes from ""starstuff."" Though I have heard this idea before, Sagan writes about it with a conviction that snared my sympathies anew. His point is just as poignant today as it was 32 (damn) years ago: our specie's propensity for killing each other is frightening and tragic, and the billions of dollars that governments devote to this enterprise only divert our attention and energy from pursuits that could sustain humanity on this planet, if not propel it well beyond our own stellar backyard.This book awakened another perturbing thought: I should have read about this decades ago and read further thereafter. Better now, I suppose, than never."
193,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074534-emily,1,"I have heard great things about this book and Carl Sagan for so long that I am ashamed to admit how little I liked it. I am only about 50 pages in and since I haven't been able to finish a single paragraph without skimming I'm just going to stop reading it. Cosmos is written in a casual, simple style almost like a story. To me it was way too simple and slow paced. Most of the first three chapters cover simple world setup and astronomy that I had learned about in more depth elsewhere. The book feels outdated to me though the facts are all still correct - very similar to the tv show of the same name (which we tried to watch but gave up on). I can't recommend this. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' much more and I feel like they have a similar purpose. "
194,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6515529-waqas-mhd,4,wow TMI. literally too much info. i don't know if i got everything but i really enjoyed it.
195,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,4,"Wow, this is pretty good. I'd never read any Sagan before reading this, nor had I seen him on television. I profess to always having been some what Sagan-illiterate. After reading this, I see why he was such an iconic figure. He had a real gift for scientific communication. Cosmos is so lucid, and really does a great job of expressing the enormity of its subject matter.However, it is often outdated. The chapters on the history of astronomy (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, etc.) are likely to be timeless. Much of what is written about our own solar system is still (to the best of my knowledge) mostly accurate. Of course, Voyager had not yet reached Uranus when this was published, so there's very little on the ice giants, for example, and we knew much less about Mars than we do now (having since visited it with a rover). And our understanding of the life cycle of stars have also (in the big picture) not changed enormously since this book was written. However, our conception of deep space has changed substantially. This book was published before dark energy / dark matter became accepted and, as such, the discussion on the expansion of the universe and the composition of deep space is very obviously dated, even in much of its basics. The final chapter on avoiding the risk of nuclear war is also less prescient in our post-Cold War present.Nevertheless, I can't not recommend this book. Sagan is an awesome nonfiction writer, and no doubt inspired countless thousands of people to pursue astronomy and physics. This shouldn't be your only stop in exploring the mysteries of the universe beyond our earth, but even if it is - well, you could do much worse."
196,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"I've seen a few people in Internet forums over the years say if there's any religion they subscribe to, it's Saganism. Obviously, it's a clever turn of phrase, but it also speaks to the fact the cosmic, scientific truths Sagan conveys here really do activate the same neural pathways of more traditional sacred experience. It's hard to walk away from any page of this book without feeling an immense sense of awe at the natural world, reverence for the universe as a whole, and a deep ethical commitment to not screw up this incredible opportunity we've been given to exist on this planet in this universe. I'm eager to read his other stuff and watch the original series now. After years of hearing so much hype about Sagan's ability to clearly communicate the inspirational wonders of scientific discovery, I was so excited to find he not just met but exceeded my high expectations."
197,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214318-roddy,5,"Stunning, beautiful prose, excellent description and metaphor, incredibly accessible. Its also one of those books where you get to see the author's own genius slip into the pages accidentally, every so often. This book is the book A Brief History of Time wants to be. Problem is, ABHOT is much more boring and high concept. Sagan is and ever will be the great teacher of the masses in my opinion. This book starts out simpler than ABHOT - here on earth. It begins with what you know and slowly expands your circle of knowledge with insightful description and simile (""the dancing of electrons with their nuclear partners across the surface of ice is like..."") Once you've got your basics, he starts taking you through the process of thinking about how it all might fit together, what scientists are currently working on (were, then working on) and thinking about. I don't hesitate to loan this to my most unscientific minded friends because its actually a great way to get them to stop thinking that stars are made from the souls of people who have died and that people just appeared on the face of the earth fully formed and wearing neckties, some 4000 years ago. Cosmos is also a very holistic book, it discusses evolution, life, the beginnings of the universe the end of the universe, the possiblity of life on other planets - and, very convincingly suggests what that might look like. It at least drives home that we have to step away from the life we are familiar with when we start theorizing what life might be like elsewhere. I can't say enough about how great this book is, how well it imbues its reader with scientific mojo, and how a book that covers textbook type material manages to be so readable. There are also (especially in the hardcover) some very pretty pictures. Note: The book cosmos was a companion/derivative of the PBS special ""Cosmos"" which Sagan worked to explain the mysteries of the universe in something like 14 episodes. You can probably buy this online if you're one of those total lamos that prefers ""the movie"". However, this movie is actually pretty awesome, albeit with very old school animations. Also Note: This book was written in the 1970s. From an outsider's perspective, physics and astrophysics (which is technically more what Cosmos is about) don't change much in 30 years, but in fact they do. Many of the theories Sagan puts forth have since proven to be quite accurate, and some, have understandably proven to be not quite accurate. Not knowing which these are won't hurt the reader; just learning how he begins his process of hypothesizing, and the idea of thinking big picture and how it all fits together is the real lesson of Cosmos. You'll need a recent astronomy or astrophysics (basic) textbook to find the plot holes though, so the recreational reader should fear not. "
198,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5120947-haritha,5,"I cannot begin to describe how amazing this book is. Of all the books I have read in my life till now, I will always remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos as the book that brought back meaning into my life. With wonderful humility, Dr. Sagan makes the unfathomably huge Cosmos come to life. His words, clearly written from the heart, are complemented by beautiful photographs and illustrations. I cannot imagine any reader being unmoved by what Dr. Sagan is telling us. As I progressed through the thirteen chapters that make this book, I went through phases of awe about how big the known Universe is, how little we know, how insignificant we are in the Cosmic scale of things, hopelessness of how petty even the biggest and most serious of international arguments (forget the minutiae of daily petty fights and grudges) are, poignancy about lost knowledge and civilizations, before I realized truly what Dr. Sagan wishes to say- human life is so, so, so, very precious. In the deafening noise of various philosophies that concern the meaning of life, Dr. Sagan's voice is the soothing balm of reason to chaffed and tired ears. This lonely planet called Earth in a forgotten corner of the Universe desperately needs more people like Dr. Sagan who can write as eloquent a book as the Cosmos. I recommend this book to each and every one. If I have kids, this book will be one they will quote as the formative book of their childhood. Carl Sagan, we miss you and you will always be my hero. "
199,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,5,"It was absolutely a stunning experience, this book is a treasure, seriously a TREASURE! It has in it almost everything you'd want to know about our universe.I won't deny that I learned a lot, and slightly appeased my eager to science, Astronomy in particular.One thing that I'd like is having the show Cosmos produced again, it would be a great opportunity to introduce ""people"" into a world of wonders."
200,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,Even after all these years (I read it for the first time ten years ago) Cosmos is still of the best science books I've ever read. 
201,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Carl Sagan's boyish enthusiasm fills this book ranging widely on scientific topics while emphasizing his life-long passion for communication with other intelligence in the universe.Like Issac Asimov, Sagan is captivated by the wonder of our physical world and eager to explain it to the general public, though Sagan ventures more into speculation while Asimov is more detail oriented - not only wanting you to know about the atom, but about the parts and the forces involved, never departing from the facts.It's impossible to read this book without finding out new things, even though it was written almost 30 years ago. For example, I did not know that our sun was formed in the company of other stars that have since dispersed across the galaxy, nor did I know that the spiral arms of our Milky Way are areas of star formation that move independently of the stars they move through. Ten million years ago the earth was within one of these spiral arms, now it is on the edge.In Cosmos, Sagan moves out from the Sun as he also takes us forward from the dawn of science. Since I've read quite a bit about the history of scientific discovery, I found the first part of this book, dealing with that subject, far less interesting than the last third where Sagan takes us off into the vastness of space, ponders the chances of life on other worlds, informs us of the weirdness of black holes, describes the life of stars and explains the possibility of another dimension that we cannot experience. He addresses the reader with respect. You feel like you are in the company of a good friend who responds to something you say with, ""yeah, I've wondered about that too and here's what I think.""Sagan has a marvelous capacity to take a subject just so far without getting bogged down in detail. There were several times I became engaged in his topic and he would carry it forward far enough for my curiosity to be satisfied. I never had that disappointing feeling of the child who says to the storytelling parent, ""but THEN what happened!?"" only to be told the story is over.The style of writing is free-flowing and natural. I don't know that I've ever sped through a book like I did this one, quickly grasping what the author has to say. There is a special kind of genius in being able to take the most abstruse subjects and present them in an understandable way. Carl Sagan writes like he was born with a pen in his hand. At the same time, his imagination is so fertile that you never can tell where he will go with a subject. His speculations about contact with another intelligence in the universe are broad and deep, this obviously being where is heart is.After closing the book, I'm impressed by how microscopic humanity is in the vastness of space and how recent we are in the immensity of time. We've only had radio for 100 years, so our electromagnetic voice has reached only 100 light years from earth, enough to get to the nearest few dozen stars, yet we are aware of, able to see through optical or radio astronomy, objects that are billions of light years from us, dating to not long after the origin of the universe.The question that hangs over this book is - are we alone? Over the billions of stars that are out there, why is there no evidence at all of intelligence elsewhere?I'm tempted to get the e-reader version of this book simply to be able to look things up easily in the future. Sagan answers so many questions, it will be easy for me to forget the answers."
202,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72985691-osama-siddique,5,"What can one say about Sagan and Cosmos that hasn't already been said. Of course I keenly devoured the show, I did have very early and deep fascination for the heavens above, and I have zealously read this one quite a few times. What Sagan has is this unique and very rare ability not just to make complex things simple, or to really bring forth and radiate the sense of awe evoked by the scale and nature of the cosmos, or a vital sense of timing and drama - of course he had all that and he was a superb scientist, teacher, presenter, actor and dramatist all rolled in one - but the unique and rare ability I want to highlight is to retain and flamboyantly convey the same deep and abiding sense of wonder, joy and excitement in the reader or the viewer as he probably felt himself the very first time he started looking for patterns in the stars. Give this book to every child, every dreamer, every would be scientist, every poet and anyone with a questioning mind. Give it also to the myopic, the dullard, the accountant and the bore. For who knows it may cure all of them. It rolls out a cosmic tapestry woven out of stars - the stuff of dreams, awe and imagination - with a master conductor and choreographer explaining the melody and rhythm of our universe. This is one of those books that you sometimes hope you had not read. Simply so that you can rediscover it and reread it and relive the thrill. Hope you are voyaging happily somewhere amongst the stars Carl. "
203,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I don't get people who find this too dry, or lacking in a sense of wonder about the world. It's full of a sense of wonder, no less potent because Sagan was agnostic (not atheist, as some people say), and he expresses this almost poetically. While some of the science is falling out of date now, it's still worth reading Cosmos -- as a primer, and for Sagan's clear explanations of how the world works, and how our understanding got to this point.I actually have the DVDs of the series as well, and while I know from seeing clips the book and the series are very similar, I'm gonna have to get round to seeing it soon. And if you've never heard of Symphony of Science, I definitely recommend it -- my favourite is 'A Glorious Dawn'.One of the things reading this really made me wonder is what Sagan would think of what we've made of the world in the last two decades. We haven't destroyed ourselves yet, but we haven't yet disarmed, we haven't even convinced everybody that climate change exists, and we still haven't gone any further from our own small planet. I wish we still had Sagan, speaking clearly and rationally about all the problems we face -- particularly because he had hope for us, as well as a warning."
204,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84821-amy,5,"I think I could categorize this book as ""life-changing"" for me. I think the reason I am interested in subjects such as classics and anthropology can be traced to this book! It's a very broad look at the history of the universe and the history of science, so even though it is a good 20+ years old, most of it still stands. Sagan writes in an engaging and accessible manner. This is definitely a great book for people who are interested in science, but a little afraid to approach a book about it. Sagan looks at the universe with awe and wonder, and he conveys these feelings to the reader."
205,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8895258-andrew-culyer,5,"There are not many books that I keep. The only ones I do keep are the ones I know I am going to read again, and this is my third time reading this.As general books about physics go, this is the best one I've ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.The subject might not appeal to a lot of people, but if you want an introduction to the cosmos, the universe, and our planet's place in it, and you don't mind having your mind opened a little bit, then I completely recommend this bookIt's going to stay on my shelf forever (or, more accurately, til the day I die)"
206,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4902544-katie,4,"I love Carl Sagan. He really does make you feel like a kid again. His excitement and enthusiasm come through clearly right from the start of this book and I'd think it would be hard for anyone not to get swept up by it. The facts and mysteries of the cosmos are fascinating especially when Carl Sagan is talking about them. There are inevitably some dry and drawn out parts,being the reason for 4 stars, but all in all fantastic. "

It leaves you somewhat different, somewhat better of a person than you were before. But rarely, very rarely, a book fundamentally alters your outlook on life and the world around you. Cosmos is such a book.Us human beings have a tendency to become complacent and indifferent as we get trapped in the humdrum rhythm of life on earth. Our minds occupied by mundane, pressing issues, we tend to forget the absurd immensity of it the cosmos - both in space and in time. This book wakes you from that slumber and takes you on a voyage from the very beginning of time to now, from the microcosm of what makes up everything to the macrocosm of everything that is. It makes you realize just how puny and insignificant, yet how remarkably special we are. We are, in Sagan's words, “starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms”Our future depends on this realization. It depends on whether we will be able to avoid self-destructing before we set on daring voyages beyond our lonely solar system. Cosmos is a book that must be read and reread, because its lessons are ones we cannot afford to forget."

“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”
Remarkable, strong, well crafted, Cosmos as far as I am concerned is a masterpiece of popular science.Carl Sagan is now one of my favorite authors and a person I greatly admire. You can see plainly how much effort was put into this book, and how genuine it is. To put it simply, he is a great writer and a great person.This book was meant as a companion to the TV show Cosmos (1980), a masterpiece on its own accord, I advise going over the two together and following up with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.As to the contents of this book, it is fair to say this book encompasses a great deal of information ranging between science and history, I guess I would call it a history of science, but it also touches on many other fields such as civilization, philosophy, and religion.The scientific fields the book goes through are many, but the main focus is, of course, astronomy.However, I would not recommend this book for its scientific content, as a lot has changed since 1980, almost 40 years now. Not that what we knew back then is now irrelevant, just less relevant as new information go piled on top of it.I recommend reading this book for several reasons. Sagan himself as one, I believe everyone should get acquainted with the men, what way would be better than hearing his words? Two, this book serves as a near-perfect gateway for astronomy and science in general, a kind of why you should care answer. Three, the historical view and perspective over the development of science are very enlightening, one can never know enough of one's own species. Four, a vision of where we are, how we came to be, and where we are going.I am pretty sure there is more, that was just off the top of my head.What I might criticize about this book is some repetitions, it made this feel less like a book and more like speech, and also like Sagan was trying to sell something, his points about extraterrestrial life and views on religion to be specific. Also, this is not exactly a very scientific book, nor an objective historical account, but that may not be a concern as it is not sold as one or the other. Arguably, if it was one of those it would not have been as beautiful and attractive. It would not have achieved as wide as an impact as it had. The emotion is a great part of why this book is so valuable.I recommend this book, for fun, for knowledge, for humanity.“What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.”“The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”"
212,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,This book and series sparked my interest in science and the universe in 1980 when I was thirteen. It is not cutting edge today but the poetry and wonder of Carl Sagan's vision still is current. Reading this book 36 years after the series reminds me of how science and a vision of universe can inspire people long after the science of the book has been surpassed. Beautiful book.

214,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"Five huge stars for this remarkable book. I've added it to my ""books everyone should read"" shelf. The Cosmos is us. It is us understanding, getting to know who we really are. So many questions are still out there, but we, the people in our wonderful and unique planet, have been able to wonder, search, and find answers always closer to the truth thanks to science.Life is so wonderful and rare, and I'm so happy my life took place in this period of time when we have been able to inherit the science and knowledge of so many generations of people and such brilliant minds as Erathostenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, and so many others. I have to make a special mention of Christian Huygens, a brilliant man I barely knew about. I definitely want to read much more about him. Also Hipatia, the last guardian of the library of Alexandria. I experienced once more the pity and overwhelming sorrow for such terrible loss. Well, in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about the path of science from the beginning, when men began to wonder, question, and learn to have a conscience of our existence and who we are up to this point when we have developed technology that allows us to keep learning about other places in our Universe beyond the only place we have ever known and where everything has ever happened to each person that has ever existed: our Earth. My final feeling is still this great awe about us, about every form of life that we see as normal and common. I share Sagan's thoughts about how pointless wars are, and hope that we can survive past them and humanity can finally learn to live only to build and perpetuate life in all its forms. If you haven't read this book yet, read it. For me it's one of those ""must""."
215,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44347175-rashit,4,"Carl Sagan presents us with a journey from the Library of Alexandria to the void of the universe. This journey is mostly a scientific journey. From time to time, non-scientific elements become part of this journey. So the book doesn't contain very heavy information. Anyway, Sagan's tongue quite understandable. That's the most powerful side of the book. On the other hand, due to science is constantly improving, some information isn't up to date. He updates some information in Cosmos's documentary. That information will be insufficient over time. Although he protects his objectivity in the whole book, he loses his objectivity in a few places. The reason is the western admiration. He says that in the development of scientific civilization, the weight of west is. This attitude isn’t scientific. Because the basis of today's science occurs works which done in the Library of Alexandria period (Sagan also agrees). After the library was burned, burned books haven’t reached today (He agrees again). It isn't known most of those books of their titles and their writers (He continues to agree). Well, if there are many writers from that library that we don't know, how can we talk so confidently about the fact that science is based on the west?"

“Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life—moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.”
Cosmos contained a great deal of information, much of which was engaging. The subject matter included: a history of humanity’s quest for understanding and notable scientific discoveries, evolution and genetics, some basic chemistry and physics (including a brief description of relativity), and, of course, astronomy. The following are some of the astronomy topics covered: the Big Bang, the life cycles of stars, details about many of our solar system’s planets and their satellites, information on a few NASA space missions, and speculation about intelligent alien life.Overall, while Cosmos was a very comprehensive summary of many different branches of knowledge, I really didn’t care for Sagan’s writing style. The first issue I had with his style is that he was often overly lyrical/mystical in tone. The text was abundantly peppered with phrases such as “the bastion and the citadel of the stars.” In my opinion, science and math are beautiful just as they are, and so dressing them up in flowery language is overkill, and can even be counterproductive. An example of this type of thing occurred when Sagan discussed nuclear fusion in stars, and where heavier chemical elements come from. This is a truly fascinating process. But then Sagan goes on to state that: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” I’m assuming he included that last sentence because he wanted readers to feel pretty pleased with ourselves…we’re all literally made out of stars! Far out! How cool are we? But if you think about it, excrement can lay claim to the same stellar forebears, which somewhat diminishes that beautiful, lofty sentiment we’re (presumably) supposed to be feeling about ourselves.My other issue with the writing is that, when it was not waxing poetic, it tended to be far too dumbed down. True, he was trying to reach a very large audience, many of whom have no background in science. That said, it would have been nice to read a book written for grown-ups.Overall, the book was just okay for me. Maybe it’s more exciting to those who haven’t taken an Intro to Astronomy course. If you’ve already studied Astronomy 101, however, there is nothing in either the writing or the personal opinions presented herein that qualify this as a must-read book."
217,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,5,"We humans have come a long way. From the days we were wandering the planet looking little different from our primate cousins, to these modern times where we take for granted technologies that would have been equated to magic just a century or so ago, we humans have made amazing progress. Science is what brought us here and science is what is going to help us evolve in the days ahead too. Science helped us see things as they are, dispelled our fears, gave us hope, made us discover fire and invent the wheel – two of the most important findings till today. While science may not have solved all our queries yet - and raises as many demons as it lays to rest - it makes genuine, continuous efforts to arrive at the Truth. Armed with science, we humans have started exploring all around us. From the microcosmic wonders of atoms to the mega marvels of Universe, science has lifted many veils and shown us things beyond our limited understanding. Scientists like Carl Sagan have played an important role in lifting those veils, not only by their direct contribution to the sciences, but also through their ability to communicate such esoteric wisdom to the masses, to laymen that are keen on understanding their surroundings but limited in their ability to do so.Books like ‘The Origin of Species’ remain special, not just because they tell us about groundbreaking discoveries, but also due to their telling it in a language that we, the laypersons, can understand. While ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan may not be as earth-shattering as ‘The Origin of Species’, it is special by its own right. Written nearly four decades ago, co-developed with a television series of the same name, this book was produced with the idea of popularizing the sciences, especially astronomy, among the masses. To the uninitiated but curious mind, this book is the ideal beginning into the wonderous realms of the cosmos. This book is to the budding astronomer what the alphabets and the arithmetic are to the young child.From the ancient budding of scientific thoughts at the Ionian islands to the then-latest launching of space missions like Voyager-2, Carl Sagan takes each stage in the evolution of science as we know it, elaborates on the circumstances prevailing at those times, enumerates important contributions by various scientists. The real fun is his doing all this in an interesting, pacey manner, without letting the reader feel bored even once. After helping us navigate the unimaginably vast expanse of our Universe and showing us the wonders of our solar system, stars, planets, galaxies and the bleak black holes along the way, Sagan ends the book with philosophical musings on the future of mankind on this nuclear era and the possibilities of our encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.This is not just a book on astronomy. Burgeoning with interesting details on history, evolution, atomic science and mathematics, this is one complete book that every mind passionate about learning must possess."

222,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365191-daniel,5,"I went into this book hoping to learn more about the Universe, and learn more I did. The chapters that dealt with star and galaxy formations were excellent, and many times I put down the book to look up something online. I had heard about a number of these topics in passing, and it was nice to read about them with more depth. For some reason, I was entranced by the concept of the 'heliopause' (look it up: it's freaking amazing), while I was outright blown away by the fact that both Voyager satellites are only a few years away from reaching this threshold of our solar system. In one of these searches, I discovered that you can subscribe to a Twitter feed for Voyager 2 that states (from a first-person POV, as if V2 is talking to you; nice) how far the satellite has traveled. According to a tweet that is one hour old (at 21:47 EST on 7/15/12), Voyager 2 was 13 hrs, 36 mins, and 44 seconds of light-travel time from Earth.One word: geekgasm.I enjoyed the historical passages, though I once again felt a massive need to branch out beyond the usual coterie of Greeks and Europeans. Sagan makes a passing reference to this cultural bias in his last chapter, stating that ""the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western Civilization"" (281). I want to contest this statement, and the fact that I feel ill-educated to do so is evidence that I have read far more about these portions of history than any other.Sagan includes passionate passages that touch upon our birthright as a species that, ultimately, comes from ""starstuff."" Though I have heard this idea before, Sagan writes about it with a conviction that snared my sympathies anew. His point is just as poignant today as it was 32 (damn) years ago: our specie's propensity for killing each other is frightening and tragic, and the billions of dollars that governments devote to this enterprise only divert our attention and energy from pursuits that could sustain humanity on this planet, if not propel it well beyond our own stellar backyard.This book awakened another perturbing thought: I should have read about this decades ago and read further thereafter. Better now, I suppose, than never."
223,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074534-emily,1,"I have heard great things about this book and Carl Sagan for so long that I am ashamed to admit how little I liked it. I am only about 50 pages in and since I haven't been able to finish a single paragraph without skimming I'm just going to stop reading it. Cosmos is written in a casual, simple style almost like a story. To me it was way too simple and slow paced. Most of the first three chapters cover simple world setup and astronomy that I had learned about in more depth elsewhere. The book feels outdated to me though the facts are all still correct - very similar to the tv show of the same name (which we tried to watch but gave up on). I can't recommend this. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' much more and I feel like they have a similar purpose. "
224,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6515529-waqas-mhd,4,wow TMI. literally too much info. i don't know if i got everything but i really enjoyed it.
225,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,4,"Wow, this is pretty good. I'd never read any Sagan before reading this, nor had I seen him on television. I profess to always having been some what Sagan-illiterate. After reading this, I see why he was such an iconic figure. He had a real gift for scientific communication. Cosmos is so lucid, and really does a great job of expressing the enormity of its subject matter.However, it is often outdated. The chapters on the history of astronomy (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, etc.) are likely to be timeless. Much of what is written about our own solar system is still (to the best of my knowledge) mostly accurate. Of course, Voyager had not yet reached Uranus when this was published, so there's very little on the ice giants, for example, and we knew much less about Mars than we do now (having since visited it with a rover). And our understanding of the life cycle of stars have also (in the big picture) not changed enormously since this book was written. However, our conception of deep space has changed substantially. This book was published before dark energy / dark matter became accepted and, as such, the discussion on the expansion of the universe and the composition of deep space is very obviously dated, even in much of its basics. The final chapter on avoiding the risk of nuclear war is also less prescient in our post-Cold War present.Nevertheless, I can't not recommend this book. Sagan is an awesome nonfiction writer, and no doubt inspired countless thousands of people to pursue astronomy and physics. This shouldn't be your only stop in exploring the mysteries of the universe beyond our earth, but even if it is - well, you could do much worse."
226,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"I've seen a few people in Internet forums over the years say if there's any religion they subscribe to, it's Saganism. Obviously, it's a clever turn of phrase, but it also speaks to the fact the cosmic, scientific truths Sagan conveys here really do activate the same neural pathways of more traditional sacred experience. It's hard to walk away from any page of this book without feeling an immense sense of awe at the natural world, reverence for the universe as a whole, and a deep ethical commitment to not screw up this incredible opportunity we've been given to exist on this planet in this universe. I'm eager to read his other stuff and watch the original series now. After years of hearing so much hype about Sagan's ability to clearly communicate the inspirational wonders of scientific discovery, I was so excited to find he not just met but exceeded my high expectations."
227,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214318-roddy,5,"Stunning, beautiful prose, excellent description and metaphor, incredibly accessible. Its also one of those books where you get to see the author's own genius slip into the pages accidentally, every so often. This book is the book A Brief History of Time wants to be. Problem is, ABHOT is much more boring and high concept. Sagan is and ever will be the great teacher of the masses in my opinion. This book starts out simpler than ABHOT - here on earth. It begins with what you know and slowly expands your circle of knowledge with insightful description and simile (""the dancing of electrons with their nuclear partners across the surface of ice is like..."") Once you've got your basics, he starts taking you through the process of thinking about how it all might fit together, what scientists are currently working on (were, then working on) and thinking about. I don't hesitate to loan this to my most unscientific minded friends because its actually a great way to get them to stop thinking that stars are made from the souls of people who have died and that people just appeared on the face of the earth fully formed and wearing neckties, some 4000 years ago. Cosmos is also a very holistic book, it discusses evolution, life, the beginnings of the universe the end of the universe, the possiblity of life on other planets - and, very convincingly suggests what that might look like. It at least drives home that we have to step away from the life we are familiar with when we start theorizing what life might be like elsewhere. I can't say enough about how great this book is, how well it imbues its reader with scientific mojo, and how a book that covers textbook type material manages to be so readable. There are also (especially in the hardcover) some very pretty pictures. Note: The book cosmos was a companion/derivative of the PBS special ""Cosmos"" which Sagan worked to explain the mysteries of the universe in something like 14 episodes. You can probably buy this online if you're one of those total lamos that prefers ""the movie"". However, this movie is actually pretty awesome, albeit with very old school animations. Also Note: This book was written in the 1970s. From an outsider's perspective, physics and astrophysics (which is technically more what Cosmos is about) don't change much in 30 years, but in fact they do. Many of the theories Sagan puts forth have since proven to be quite accurate, and some, have understandably proven to be not quite accurate. Not knowing which these are won't hurt the reader; just learning how he begins his process of hypothesizing, and the idea of thinking big picture and how it all fits together is the real lesson of Cosmos. You'll need a recent astronomy or astrophysics (basic) textbook to find the plot holes though, so the recreational reader should fear not. "
228,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5120947-haritha,5,"I cannot begin to describe how amazing this book is. Of all the books I have read in my life till now, I will always remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos as the book that brought back meaning into my life. With wonderful humility, Dr. Sagan makes the unfathomably huge Cosmos come to life. His words, clearly written from the heart, are complemented by beautiful photographs and illustrations. I cannot imagine any reader being unmoved by what Dr. Sagan is telling us. As I progressed through the thirteen chapters that make this book, I went through phases of awe about how big the known Universe is, how little we know, how insignificant we are in the Cosmic scale of things, hopelessness of how petty even the biggest and most serious of international arguments (forget the minutiae of daily petty fights and grudges) are, poignancy about lost knowledge and civilizations, before I realized truly what Dr. Sagan wishes to say- human life is so, so, so, very precious. In the deafening noise of various philosophies that concern the meaning of life, Dr. Sagan's voice is the soothing balm of reason to chaffed and tired ears. This lonely planet called Earth in a forgotten corner of the Universe desperately needs more people like Dr. Sagan who can write as eloquent a book as the Cosmos. I recommend this book to each and every one. If I have kids, this book will be one they will quote as the formative book of their childhood. Carl Sagan, we miss you and you will always be my hero. "
229,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,5,"It was absolutely a stunning experience, this book is a treasure, seriously a TREASURE! It has in it almost everything you'd want to know about our universe.I won't deny that I learned a lot, and slightly appeased my eager to science, Astronomy in particular.One thing that I'd like is having the show Cosmos produced again, it would be a great opportunity to introduce ""people"" into a world of wonders."
230,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,Even after all these years (I read it for the first time ten years ago) Cosmos is still of the best science books I've ever read. 
231,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Carl Sagan's boyish enthusiasm fills this book ranging widely on scientific topics while emphasizing his life-long passion for communication with other intelligence in the universe.Like Issac Asimov, Sagan is captivated by the wonder of our physical world and eager to explain it to the general public, though Sagan ventures more into speculation while Asimov is more detail oriented - not only wanting you to know about the atom, but about the parts and the forces involved, never departing from the facts.It's impossible to read this book without finding out new things, even though it was written almost 30 years ago. For example, I did not know that our sun was formed in the company of other stars that have since dispersed across the galaxy, nor did I know that the spiral arms of our Milky Way are areas of star formation that move independently of the stars they move through. Ten million years ago the earth was within one of these spiral arms, now it is on the edge.In Cosmos, Sagan moves out from the Sun as he also takes us forward from the dawn of science. Since I've read quite a bit about the history of scientific discovery, I found the first part of this book, dealing with that subject, far less interesting than the last third where Sagan takes us off into the vastness of space, ponders the chances of life on other worlds, informs us of the weirdness of black holes, describes the life of stars and explains the possibility of another dimension that we cannot experience. He addresses the reader with respect. You feel like you are in the company of a good friend who responds to something you say with, ""yeah, I've wondered about that too and here's what I think.""Sagan has a marvelous capacity to take a subject just so far without getting bogged down in detail. There were several times I became engaged in his topic and he would carry it forward far enough for my curiosity to be satisfied. I never had that disappointing feeling of the child who says to the storytelling parent, ""but THEN what happened!?"" only to be told the story is over.The style of writing is free-flowing and natural. I don't know that I've ever sped through a book like I did this one, quickly grasping what the author has to say. There is a special kind of genius in being able to take the most abstruse subjects and present them in an understandable way. Carl Sagan writes like he was born with a pen in his hand. At the same time, his imagination is so fertile that you never can tell where he will go with a subject. His speculations about contact with another intelligence in the universe are broad and deep, this obviously being where is heart is.After closing the book, I'm impressed by how microscopic humanity is in the vastness of space and how recent we are in the immensity of time. We've only had radio for 100 years, so our electromagnetic voice has reached only 100 light years from earth, enough to get to the nearest few dozen stars, yet we are aware of, able to see through optical or radio astronomy, objects that are billions of light years from us, dating to not long after the origin of the universe.The question that hangs over this book is - are we alone? Over the billions of stars that are out there, why is there no evidence at all of intelligence elsewhere?I'm tempted to get the e-reader version of this book simply to be able to look things up easily in the future. Sagan answers so many questions, it will be easy for me to forget the answers."
232,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72985691-osama-siddique,5,"What can one say about Sagan and Cosmos that hasn't already been said. Of course I keenly devoured the show, I did have very early and deep fascination for the heavens above, and I have zealously read this one quite a few times. What Sagan has is this unique and very rare ability not just to make complex things simple, or to really bring forth and radiate the sense of awe evoked by the scale and nature of the cosmos, or a vital sense of timing and drama - of course he had all that and he was a superb scientist, teacher, presenter, actor and dramatist all rolled in one - but the unique and rare ability I want to highlight is to retain and flamboyantly convey the same deep and abiding sense of wonder, joy and excitement in the reader or the viewer as he probably felt himself the very first time he started looking for patterns in the stars. Give this book to every child, every dreamer, every would be scientist, every poet and anyone with a questioning mind. Give it also to the myopic, the dullard, the accountant and the bore. For who knows it may cure all of them. It rolls out a cosmic tapestry woven out of stars - the stuff of dreams, awe and imagination - with a master conductor and choreographer explaining the melody and rhythm of our universe. This is one of those books that you sometimes hope you had not read. Simply so that you can rediscover it and reread it and relive the thrill. Hope you are voyaging happily somewhere amongst the stars Carl. "
233,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I don't get people who find this too dry, or lacking in a sense of wonder about the world. It's full of a sense of wonder, no less potent because Sagan was agnostic (not atheist, as some people say), and he expresses this almost poetically. While some of the science is falling out of date now, it's still worth reading Cosmos -- as a primer, and for Sagan's clear explanations of how the world works, and how our understanding got to this point.I actually have the DVDs of the series as well, and while I know from seeing clips the book and the series are very similar, I'm gonna have to get round to seeing it soon. And if you've never heard of Symphony of Science, I definitely recommend it -- my favourite is 'A Glorious Dawn'.One of the things reading this really made me wonder is what Sagan would think of what we've made of the world in the last two decades. We haven't destroyed ourselves yet, but we haven't yet disarmed, we haven't even convinced everybody that climate change exists, and we still haven't gone any further from our own small planet. I wish we still had Sagan, speaking clearly and rationally about all the problems we face -- particularly because he had hope for us, as well as a warning."
234,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84821-amy,5,"I think I could categorize this book as ""life-changing"" for me. I think the reason I am interested in subjects such as classics and anthropology can be traced to this book! It's a very broad look at the history of the universe and the history of science, so even though it is a good 20+ years old, most of it still stands. Sagan writes in an engaging and accessible manner. This is definitely a great book for people who are interested in science, but a little afraid to approach a book about it. Sagan looks at the universe with awe and wonder, and he conveys these feelings to the reader."
235,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8895258-andrew-culyer,5,"There are not many books that I keep. The only ones I do keep are the ones I know I am going to read again, and this is my third time reading this.As general books about physics go, this is the best one I've ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.The subject might not appeal to a lot of people, but if you want an introduction to the cosmos, the universe, and our planet's place in it, and you don't mind having your mind opened a little bit, then I completely recommend this bookIt's going to stay on my shelf forever (or, more accurately, til the day I die)"
236,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4902544-katie,4,"I love Carl Sagan. He really does make you feel like a kid again. His excitement and enthusiasm come through clearly right from the start of this book and I'd think it would be hard for anyone not to get swept up by it. The facts and mysteries of the cosmos are fascinating especially when Carl Sagan is talking about them. There are inevitably some dry and drawn out parts,being the reason for 4 stars, but all in all fantastic. "

It leaves you somewhat different, somewhat better of a person than you were before. But rarely, very rarely, a book fundamentally alters your outlook on life and the world around you. Cosmos is such a book.Us human beings have a tendency to become complacent and indifferent as we get trapped in the humdrum rhythm of life on earth. Our minds occupied by mundane, pressing issues, we tend to forget the absurd immensity of it the cosmos - both in space and in time. This book wakes you from that slumber and takes you on a voyage from the very beginning of time to now, from the microcosm of what makes up everything to the macrocosm of everything that is. It makes you realize just how puny and insignificant, yet how remarkably special we are. We are, in Sagan's words, “starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms”Our future depends on this realization. It depends on whether we will be able to avoid self-destructing before we set on daring voyages beyond our lonely solar system. Cosmos is a book that must be read and reread, because its lessons are ones we cannot afford to forget."

“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”
Remarkable, strong, well crafted, Cosmos as far as I am concerned is a masterpiece of popular science.Carl Sagan is now one of my favorite authors and a person I greatly admire. You can see plainly how much effort was put into this book, and how genuine it is. To put it simply, he is a great writer and a great person.This book was meant as a companion to the TV show Cosmos (1980), a masterpiece on its own accord, I advise going over the two together and following up with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.As to the contents of this book, it is fair to say this book encompasses a great deal of information ranging between science and history, I guess I would call it a history of science, but it also touches on many other fields such as civilization, philosophy, and religion.The scientific fields the book goes through are many, but the main focus is, of course, astronomy.However, I would not recommend this book for its scientific content, as a lot has changed since 1980, almost 40 years now. Not that what we knew back then is now irrelevant, just less relevant as new information go piled on top of it.I recommend reading this book for several reasons. Sagan himself as one, I believe everyone should get acquainted with the men, what way would be better than hearing his words? Two, this book serves as a near-perfect gateway for astronomy and science in general, a kind of why you should care answer. Three, the historical view and perspective over the development of science are very enlightening, one can never know enough of one's own species. Four, a vision of where we are, how we came to be, and where we are going.I am pretty sure there is more, that was just off the top of my head.What I might criticize about this book is some repetitions, it made this feel less like a book and more like speech, and also like Sagan was trying to sell something, his points about extraterrestrial life and views on religion to be specific. Also, this is not exactly a very scientific book, nor an objective historical account, but that may not be a concern as it is not sold as one or the other. Arguably, if it was one of those it would not have been as beautiful and attractive. It would not have achieved as wide as an impact as it had. The emotion is a great part of why this book is so valuable.I recommend this book, for fun, for knowledge, for humanity.“What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.”“The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”"
242,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,This book and series sparked my interest in science and the universe in 1980 when I was thirteen. It is not cutting edge today but the poetry and wonder of Carl Sagan's vision still is current. Reading this book 36 years after the series reminds me of how science and a vision of universe can inspire people long after the science of the book has been surpassed. Beautiful book.

It is us understanding, getting to know who we really are. So many questions are still out there, but we, the people in our wonderful and unique planet, have been able to wonder, search, and find answers always closer to the truth thanks to science.Life is so wonderful and rare, and I'm so happy my life took place in this period of time when we have been able to inherit the science and knowledge of so many generations of people and such brilliant minds as Erathostenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, and so many others. I have to make a special mention of Christian Huygens, a brilliant man I barely knew about. I definitely want to read much more about him. Also Hipatia, the last guardian of the library of Alexandria. I experienced once more the pity and overwhelming sorrow for such terrible loss. Well, in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about the path of science from the beginning, when men began to wonder, question, and learn to have a conscience of our existence and who we are up to this point when we have developed technology that allows us to keep learning about other places in our Universe beyond the only place we have ever known and where everything has ever happened to each person that has ever existed: our Earth. My final feeling is still this great awe about us, about every form of life that we see as normal and common. I share Sagan's thoughts about how pointless wars are, and hope that we can survive past them and humanity can finally learn to live only to build and perpetuate life in all its forms. If you haven't read this book yet, read it. For me it's one of those ""must""."
245,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44347175-rashit,4,"Carl Sagan presents us with a journey from the Library of Alexandria to the void of the universe. This journey is mostly a scientific journey. From time to time, non-scientific elements become part of this journey. So the book doesn't contain very heavy information. Anyway, Sagan's tongue quite understandable. That's the most powerful side of the book. On the other hand, due to science is constantly improving, some information isn't up to date. He updates some information in Cosmos's documentary. That information will be insufficient over time. Although he protects his objectivity in the whole book, he loses his objectivity in a few places. The reason is the western admiration. He says that in the development of scientific civilization, the weight of west is. This attitude isn’t scientific. Because the basis of today's science occurs works which done in the Library of Alexandria period (Sagan also agrees). After the library was burned, burned books haven’t reached today (He agrees again). It isn't known most of those books of their titles and their writers (He continues to agree). Well, if there are many writers from that library that we don't know, how can we talk so confidently about the fact that science is based on the west?"

“Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life—moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.”
Cosmos contained a great deal of information, much of which was engaging. The subject matter included: a history of humanity’s quest for understanding and notable scientific discoveries, evolution and genetics, some basic chemistry and physics (including a brief description of relativity), and, of course, astronomy. The following are some of the astronomy topics covered: the Big Bang, the life cycles of stars, details about many of our solar system’s planets and their satellites, information on a few NASA space missions, and speculation about intelligent alien life.Overall, while Cosmos was a very comprehensive summary of many different branches of knowledge, I really didn’t care for Sagan’s writing style. The first issue I had with his style is that he was often overly lyrical/mystical in tone. The text was abundantly peppered with phrases such as “the bastion and the citadel of the stars.” In my opinion, science and math are beautiful just as they are, and so dressing them up in flowery language is overkill, and can even be counterproductive. An example of this type of thing occurred when Sagan discussed nuclear fusion in stars, and where heavier chemical elements come from. This is a truly fascinating process. But then Sagan goes on to state that: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” I’m assuming he included that last sentence because he wanted readers to feel pretty pleased with ourselves…we’re all literally made out of stars! Far out! How cool are we? But if you think about it, excrement can lay claim to the same stellar forebears, which somewhat diminishes that beautiful, lofty sentiment we’re (presumably) supposed to be feeling about ourselves.My other issue with the writing is that, when it was not waxing poetic, it tended to be far too dumbed down. True, he was trying to reach a very large audience, many of whom have no background in science. That said, it would have been nice to read a book written for grown-ups.Overall, the book was just okay for me. Maybe it’s more exciting to those who haven’t taken an Intro to Astronomy course. If you’ve already studied Astronomy 101, however, there is nothing in either the writing or the personal opinions presented herein that qualify this as a must-read book."

Scientists like Carl Sagan have played an important role in lifting those veils, not only by their direct contribution to the sciences, but also through their ability to communicate such esoteric wisdom to the masses, to laymen that are keen on understanding their surroundings but limited in their ability to do so.Books like ‘The Origin of Species’ remain special, not just because they tell us about groundbreaking discoveries, but also due to their telling it in a language that we, the laypersons, can understand. While ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan may not be as earth-shattering as ‘The Origin of Species’, it is special by its own right. Written nearly four decades ago, co-developed with a television series of the same name, this book was produced with the idea of popularizing the sciences, especially astronomy, among the masses. To the uninitiated but curious mind, this book is the ideal beginning into the wonderous realms of the cosmos. This book is to the budding astronomer what the alphabets and the arithmetic are to the young child.From the ancient budding of scientific thoughts at the Ionian islands to the then-latest launching of space missions like Voyager-2, Carl Sagan takes each stage in the evolution of science as we know it, elaborates on the circumstances prevailing at those times, enumerates important contributions by various scientists. The real fun is his doing all this in an interesting, pacey manner, without letting the reader feel bored even once. After helping us navigate the unimaginably vast expanse of our Universe and showing us the wonders of our solar system, stars, planets, galaxies and the bleak black holes along the way, Sagan ends the book with philosophical musings on the future of mankind on this nuclear era and the possibilities of our encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.This is not just a book on astronomy. Burgeoning with interesting details on history, evolution, atomic science and mathematics, this is one complete book that every mind passionate about learning must possess."

More so if you aren't :)Wasn't sure of picking this in 2018, thinking much of the stuff could be outdated.Well... this is evergreen!This is the story of evolution of science.

251,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7597055-asma,5,Kind of want to change the rating of everything I've read just so Cosmos can have 5 stars and Cosmos alone. 
252,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365191-daniel,5,"I went into this book hoping to learn more about the Universe, and learn more I did. The chapters that dealt with star and galaxy formations were excellent, and many times I put down the book to look up something online. I had heard about a number of these topics in passing, and it was nice to read about them with more depth. For some reason, I was entranced by the concept of the 'heliopause' (look it up: it's freaking amazing), while I was outright blown away by the fact that both Voyager satellites are only a few years away from reaching this threshold of our solar system. In one of these searches, I discovered that you can subscribe to a Twitter feed for Voyager 2 that states (from a first-person POV, as if V2 is talking to you; nice) how far the satellite has traveled. According to a tweet that is one hour old (at 21:47 EST on 7/15/12), Voyager 2 was 13 hrs, 36 mins, and 44 seconds of light-travel time from Earth.One word: geekgasm.I enjoyed the historical passages, though I once again felt a massive need to branch out beyond the usual coterie of Greeks and Europeans. Sagan makes a passing reference to this cultural bias in his last chapter, stating that ""the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western Civilization"" (281). I want to contest this statement, and the fact that I feel ill-educated to do so is evidence that I have read far more about these portions of history than any other.Sagan includes passionate passages that touch upon our birthright as a species that, ultimately, comes from ""starstuff."" Though I have heard this idea before, Sagan writes about it with a conviction that snared my sympathies anew. His point is just as poignant today as it was 32 (damn) years ago: our specie's propensity for killing each other is frightening and tragic, and the billions of dollars that governments devote to this enterprise only divert our attention and energy from pursuits that could sustain humanity on this planet, if not propel it well beyond our own stellar backyard.This book awakened another perturbing thought: I should have read about this decades ago and read further thereafter. Better now, I suppose, than never."
253,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074534-emily,1,"I have heard great things about this book and Carl Sagan for so long that I am ashamed to admit how little I liked it. I am only about 50 pages in and since I haven't been able to finish a single paragraph without skimming I'm just going to stop reading it. Cosmos is written in a casual, simple style almost like a story. To me it was way too simple and slow paced. Most of the first three chapters cover simple world setup and astronomy that I had learned about in more depth elsewhere. The book feels outdated to me though the facts are all still correct - very similar to the tv show of the same name (which we tried to watch but gave up on). I can't recommend this. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' much more and I feel like they have a similar purpose. "
254,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6515529-waqas-mhd,4,wow TMI. literally too much info. i don't know if i got everything but i really enjoyed it.
255,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,4,"Wow, this is pretty good. I'd never read any Sagan before reading this, nor had I seen him on television. I profess to always having been some what Sagan-illiterate. After reading this, I see why he was such an iconic figure. He had a real gift for scientific communication. Cosmos is so lucid, and really does a great job of expressing the enormity of its subject matter.However, it is often outdated. The chapters on the history of astronomy (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, etc.) are likely to be timeless. Much of what is written about our own solar system is still (to the best of my knowledge) mostly accurate. Of course, Voyager had not yet reached Uranus when this was published, so there's very little on the ice giants, for example, and we knew much less about Mars than we do now (having since visited it with a rover). And our understanding of the life cycle of stars have also (in the big picture) not changed enormously since this book was written. However, our conception of deep space has changed substantially. This book was published before dark energy / dark matter became accepted and, as such, the discussion on the expansion of the universe and the composition of deep space is very obviously dated, even in much of its basics. The final chapter on avoiding the risk of nuclear war is also less prescient in our post-Cold War present.Nevertheless, I can't not recommend this book. Sagan is an awesome nonfiction writer, and no doubt inspired countless thousands of people to pursue astronomy and physics. This shouldn't be your only stop in exploring the mysteries of the universe beyond our earth, but even if it is - well, you could do much worse."
256,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"I've seen a few people in Internet forums over the years say if there's any religion they subscribe to, it's Saganism. Obviously, it's a clever turn of phrase, but it also speaks to the fact the cosmic, scientific truths Sagan conveys here really do activate the same neural pathways of more traditional sacred experience. It's hard to walk away from any page of this book without feeling an immense sense of awe at the natural world, reverence for the universe as a whole, and a deep ethical commitment to not screw up this incredible opportunity we've been given to exist on this planet in this universe. I'm eager to read his other stuff and watch the original series now. After years of hearing so much hype about Sagan's ability to clearly communicate the inspirational wonders of scientific discovery, I was so excited to find he not just met but exceeded my high expectations."
257,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214318-roddy,5,"Stunning, beautiful prose, excellent description and metaphor, incredibly accessible. Its also one of those books where you get to see the author's own genius slip into the pages accidentally, every so often. This book is the book A Brief History of Time wants to be. Problem is, ABHOT is much more boring and high concept. Sagan is and ever will be the great teacher of the masses in my opinion. This book starts out simpler than ABHOT - here on earth. It begins with what you know and slowly expands your circle of knowledge with insightful description and simile (""the dancing of electrons with their nuclear partners across the surface of ice is like..."") Once you've got your basics, he starts taking you through the process of thinking about how it all might fit together, what scientists are currently working on (were, then working on) and thinking about. I don't hesitate to loan this to my most unscientific minded friends because its actually a great way to get them to stop thinking that stars are made from the souls of people who have died and that people just appeared on the face of the earth fully formed and wearing neckties, some 4000 years ago. Cosmos is also a very holistic book, it discusses evolution, life, the beginnings of the universe the end of the universe, the possiblity of life on other planets - and, very convincingly suggests what that might look like. It at least drives home that we have to step away from the life we are familiar with when we start theorizing what life might be like elsewhere. I can't say enough about how great this book is, how well it imbues its reader with scientific mojo, and how a book that covers textbook type material manages to be so readable. There are also (especially in the hardcover) some very pretty pictures. Note: The book cosmos was a companion/derivative of the PBS special ""Cosmos"" which Sagan worked to explain the mysteries of the universe in something like 14 episodes. You can probably buy this online if you're one of those total lamos that prefers ""the movie"". However, this movie is actually pretty awesome, albeit with very old school animations. Also Note: This book was written in the 1970s. From an outsider's perspective, physics and astrophysics (which is technically more what Cosmos is about) don't change much in 30 years, but in fact they do. Many of the theories Sagan puts forth have since proven to be quite accurate, and some, have understandably proven to be not quite accurate. Not knowing which these are won't hurt the reader; just learning how he begins his process of hypothesizing, and the idea of thinking big picture and how it all fits together is the real lesson of Cosmos. You'll need a recent astronomy or astrophysics (basic) textbook to find the plot holes though, so the recreational reader should fear not. "
258,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5120947-haritha,5,"I cannot begin to describe how amazing this book is. Of all the books I have read in my life till now, I will always remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos as the book that brought back meaning into my life. With wonderful humility, Dr. Sagan makes the unfathomably huge Cosmos come to life. His words, clearly written from the heart, are complemented by beautiful photographs and illustrations. I cannot imagine any reader being unmoved by what Dr. Sagan is telling us. As I progressed through the thirteen chapters that make this book, I went through phases of awe about how big the known Universe is, how little we know, how insignificant we are in the Cosmic scale of things, hopelessness of how petty even the biggest and most serious of international arguments (forget the minutiae of daily petty fights and grudges) are, poignancy about lost knowledge and civilizations, before I realized truly what Dr. Sagan wishes to say- human life is so, so, so, very precious. In the deafening noise of various philosophies that concern the meaning of life, Dr. Sagan's voice is the soothing balm of reason to chaffed and tired ears. This lonely planet called Earth in a forgotten corner of the Universe desperately needs more people like Dr. Sagan who can write as eloquent a book as the Cosmos. I recommend this book to each and every one. If I have kids, this book will be one they will quote as the formative book of their childhood. Carl Sagan, we miss you and you will always be my hero. "
259,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,5,"It was absolutely a stunning experience, this book is a treasure, seriously a TREASURE! It has in it almost everything you'd want to know about our universe.I won't deny that I learned a lot, and slightly appeased my eager to science, Astronomy in particular.One thing that I'd like is having the show Cosmos produced again, it would be a great opportunity to introduce ""people"" into a world of wonders."
260,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,Even after all these years (I read it for the first time ten years ago) Cosmos is still of the best science books I've ever read. 
261,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Carl Sagan's boyish enthusiasm fills this book ranging widely on scientific topics while emphasizing his life-long passion for communication with other intelligence in the universe.Like Issac Asimov, Sagan is captivated by the wonder of our physical world and eager to explain it to the general public, though Sagan ventures more into speculation while Asimov is more detail oriented - not only wanting you to know about the atom, but about the parts and the forces involved, never departing from the facts.It's impossible to read this book without finding out new things, even though it was written almost 30 years ago. For example, I did not know that our sun was formed in the company of other stars that have since dispersed across the galaxy, nor did I know that the spiral arms of our Milky Way are areas of star formation that move independently of the stars they move through. Ten million years ago the earth was within one of these spiral arms, now it is on the edge.In Cosmos, Sagan moves out from the Sun as he also takes us forward from the dawn of science. Since I've read quite a bit about the history of scientific discovery, I found the first part of this book, dealing with that subject, far less interesting than the last third where Sagan takes us off into the vastness of space, ponders the chances of life on other worlds, informs us of the weirdness of black holes, describes the life of stars and explains the possibility of another dimension that we cannot experience. He addresses the reader with respect. You feel like you are in the company of a good friend who responds to something you say with, ""yeah, I've wondered about that too and here's what I think.""Sagan has a marvelous capacity to take a subject just so far without getting bogged down in detail. There were several times I became engaged in his topic and he would carry it forward far enough for my curiosity to be satisfied. I never had that disappointing feeling of the child who says to the storytelling parent, ""but THEN what happened!?"" only to be told the story is over.The style of writing is free-flowing and natural. I don't know that I've ever sped through a book like I did this one, quickly grasping what the author has to say. There is a special kind of genius in being able to take the most abstruse subjects and present them in an understandable way. Carl Sagan writes like he was born with a pen in his hand. At the same time, his imagination is so fertile that you never can tell where he will go with a subject. His speculations about contact with another intelligence in the universe are broad and deep, this obviously being where is heart is.After closing the book, I'm impressed by how microscopic humanity is in the vastness of space and how recent we are in the immensity of time. We've only had radio for 100 years, so our electromagnetic voice has reached only 100 light years from earth, enough to get to the nearest few dozen stars, yet we are aware of, able to see through optical or radio astronomy, objects that are billions of light years from us, dating to not long after the origin of the universe.The question that hangs over this book is - are we alone? Over the billions of stars that are out there, why is there no evidence at all of intelligence elsewhere?I'm tempted to get the e-reader version of this book simply to be able to look things up easily in the future. Sagan answers so many questions, it will be easy for me to forget the answers."
262,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72985691-osama-siddique,5,"What can one say about Sagan and Cosmos that hasn't already been said. Of course I keenly devoured the show, I did have very early and deep fascination for the heavens above, and I have zealously read this one quite a few times. What Sagan has is this unique and very rare ability not just to make complex things simple, or to really bring forth and radiate the sense of awe evoked by the scale and nature of the cosmos, or a vital sense of timing and drama - of course he had all that and he was a superb scientist, teacher, presenter, actor and dramatist all rolled in one - but the unique and rare ability I want to highlight is to retain and flamboyantly convey the same deep and abiding sense of wonder, joy and excitement in the reader or the viewer as he probably felt himself the very first time he started looking for patterns in the stars. Give this book to every child, every dreamer, every would be scientist, every poet and anyone with a questioning mind. Give it also to the myopic, the dullard, the accountant and the bore. For who knows it may cure all of them. It rolls out a cosmic tapestry woven out of stars - the stuff of dreams, awe and imagination - with a master conductor and choreographer explaining the melody and rhythm of our universe. This is one of those books that you sometimes hope you had not read. Simply so that you can rediscover it and reread it and relive the thrill. Hope you are voyaging happily somewhere amongst the stars Carl. "
263,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I don't get people who find this too dry, or lacking in a sense of wonder about the world. It's full of a sense of wonder, no less potent because Sagan was agnostic (not atheist, as some people say), and he expresses this almost poetically. While some of the science is falling out of date now, it's still worth reading Cosmos -- as a primer, and for Sagan's clear explanations of how the world works, and how our understanding got to this point.I actually have the DVDs of the series as well, and while I know from seeing clips the book and the series are very similar, I'm gonna have to get round to seeing it soon. And if you've never heard of Symphony of Science, I definitely recommend it -- my favourite is 'A Glorious Dawn'.One of the things reading this really made me wonder is what Sagan would think of what we've made of the world in the last two decades. We haven't destroyed ourselves yet, but we haven't yet disarmed, we haven't even convinced everybody that climate change exists, and we still haven't gone any further from our own small planet. I wish we still had Sagan, speaking clearly and rationally about all the problems we face -- particularly because he had hope for us, as well as a warning."
264,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84821-amy,5,"I think I could categorize this book as ""life-changing"" for me. I think the reason I am interested in subjects such as classics and anthropology can be traced to this book! It's a very broad look at the history of the universe and the history of science, so even though it is a good 20+ years old, most of it still stands. Sagan writes in an engaging and accessible manner. This is definitely a great book for people who are interested in science, but a little afraid to approach a book about it. Sagan looks at the universe with awe and wonder, and he conveys these feelings to the reader."
265,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8895258-andrew-culyer,5,"There are not many books that I keep. The only ones I do keep are the ones I know I am going to read again, and this is my third time reading this.As general books about physics go, this is the best one I've ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.The subject might not appeal to a lot of people, but if you want an introduction to the cosmos, the universe, and our planet's place in it, and you don't mind having your mind opened a little bit, then I completely recommend this bookIt's going to stay on my shelf forever (or, more accurately, til the day I die)"
266,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4902544-katie,4,"I love Carl Sagan. He really does make you feel like a kid again. His excitement and enthusiasm come through clearly right from the start of this book and I'd think it would be hard for anyone not to get swept up by it. The facts and mysteries of the cosmos are fascinating especially when Carl Sagan is talking about them. There are inevitably some dry and drawn out parts,being the reason for 4 stars, but all in all fantastic. "
267,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17196555-ankit,5,I don't think I will ever encounter a better book in science genre. I urge you to read this!

It leaves you somewhat different, somewhat better of a person than you were before. But rarely, very rarely, a book fundamentally alters your outlook on life and the world around you. Cosmos is such a book.Us human beings have a tendency to become complacent and indifferent as we get trapped in the humdrum rhythm of life on earth. Our minds occupied by mundane, pressing issues, we tend to forget the absurd immensity of it the cosmos - both in space and in time. This book wakes you from that slumber and takes you on a voyage from the very beginning of time to now, from the microcosm of what makes up everything to the macrocosm of everything that is. It makes you realize just how puny and insignificant, yet how remarkably special we are. We are, in Sagan's words, “starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms”Our future depends on this realization. It depends on whether we will be able to avoid self-destructing before we set on daring voyages beyond our lonely solar system. Cosmos is a book that must be read and reread, because its lessons are ones we cannot afford to forget."

“Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.”
Remarkable, strong, well crafted, Cosmos as far as I am concerned is a masterpiece of popular science.Carl Sagan is now one of my favorite authors and a person I greatly admire. You can see plainly how much effort was put into this book, and how genuine it is. To put it simply, he is a great writer and a great person.This book was meant as a companion to the TV show Cosmos (1980), a masterpiece on its own accord, I advise going over the two together and following up with Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.As to the contents of this book, it is fair to say this book encompasses a great deal of information ranging between science and history, I guess I would call it a history of science, but it also touches on many other fields such as civilization, philosophy, and religion.The scientific fields the book goes through are many, but the main focus is, of course, astronomy.However, I would not recommend this book for its scientific content, as a lot has changed since 1980, almost 40 years now. Not that what we knew back then is now irrelevant, just less relevant as new information go piled on top of it.I recommend reading this book for several reasons. Sagan himself as one, I believe everyone should get acquainted with the men, what way would be better than hearing his words? Two, this book serves as a near-perfect gateway for astronomy and science in general, a kind of why you should care answer. Three, the historical view and perspective over the development of science are very enlightening, one can never know enough of one's own species. Four, a vision of where we are, how we came to be, and where we are going.I am pretty sure there is more, that was just off the top of my head.What I might criticize about this book is some repetitions, it made this feel less like a book and more like speech, and also like Sagan was trying to sell something, his points about extraterrestrial life and views on religion to be specific. Also, this is not exactly a very scientific book, nor an objective historical account, but that may not be a concern as it is not sold as one or the other. Arguably, if it was one of those it would not have been as beautiful and attractive. It would not have achieved as wide as an impact as it had. The emotion is a great part of why this book is so valuable.I recommend this book, for fun, for knowledge, for humanity.“What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""“The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.”“The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.”"
272,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,This book and series sparked my interest in science and the universe in 1980 when I was thirteen. It is not cutting edge today but the poetry and wonder of Carl Sagan's vision still is current. Reading this book 36 years after the series reminds me of how science and a vision of universe can inspire people long after the science of the book has been surpassed. Beautiful book.

It is us understanding, getting to know who we really are. So many questions are still out there, but we, the people in our wonderful and unique planet, have been able to wonder, search, and find answers always closer to the truth thanks to science.Life is so wonderful and rare, and I'm so happy my life took place in this period of time when we have been able to inherit the science and knowledge of so many generations of people and such brilliant minds as Erathostenes, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Darwin, and so many others. I have to make a special mention of Christian Huygens, a brilliant man I barely knew about. I definitely want to read much more about him. Also Hipatia, the last guardian of the library of Alexandria. I experienced once more the pity and overwhelming sorrow for such terrible loss. Well, in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about the path of science from the beginning, when men began to wonder, question, and learn to have a conscience of our existence and who we are up to this point when we have developed technology that allows us to keep learning about other places in our Universe beyond the only place we have ever known and where everything has ever happened to each person that has ever existed: our Earth. My final feeling is still this great awe about us, about every form of life that we see as normal and common. I share Sagan's thoughts about how pointless wars are, and hope that we can survive past them and humanity can finally learn to live only to build and perpetuate life in all its forms. If you haven't read this book yet, read it. For me it's one of those ""must""."

This journey is mostly a scientific journey. From time to time, non-scientific elements become part of this journey. So the book doesn't contain very heavy information. Anyway, Sagan's tongue quite understandable. That's the most powerful side of the book. On the other hand, due to science is constantly improving, some information isn't up to date. He updates some information in Cosmos's documentary. That information will be insufficient over time. Although he protects his objectivity in the whole book, he loses his objectivity in a few places. The reason is the western admiration. He says that in the development of scientific civilization, the weight of west is. This attitude isn’t scientific. Because the basis of today's science occurs works which done in the Library of Alexandria period (Sagan also agrees). After the library was burned, burned books haven’t reached today (He agrees again). It isn't known most of those books of their titles and their writers (He continues to agree). Well, if there are many writers from that library that we don't know, how can we talk so confidently about the fact that science is based on the west?"

“Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is perfectly suitable for life—moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely well adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms of life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well. Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.”
Cosmos contained a great deal of information, much of which was engaging. The subject matter included: a history of humanity’s quest for understanding and notable scientific discoveries, evolution and genetics, some basic chemistry and physics (including a brief description of relativity), and, of course, astronomy. The following are some of the astronomy topics covered: the Big Bang, the life cycles of stars, details about many of our solar system’s planets and their satellites, information on a few NASA space missions, and speculation about intelligent alien life.Overall, while Cosmos was a very comprehensive summary of many different branches of knowledge, I really didn’t care for Sagan’s writing style. The first issue I had with his style is that he was often overly lyrical/mystical in tone. The text was abundantly peppered with phrases such as “the bastion and the citadel of the stars.” In my opinion, science and math are beautiful just as they are, and so dressing them up in flowery language is overkill, and can even be counterproductive. An example of this type of thing occurred when Sagan discussed nuclear fusion in stars, and where heavier chemical elements come from. This is a truly fascinating process. But then Sagan goes on to state that: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” I’m assuming he included that last sentence because he wanted readers to feel pretty pleased with ourselves…we’re all literally made out of stars! Far out! How cool are we? But if you think about it, excrement can lay claim to the same stellar forebears, which somewhat diminishes that beautiful, lofty sentiment we’re (presumably) supposed to be feeling about ourselves.My other issue with the writing is that, when it was not waxing poetic, it tended to be far too dumbed down. True, he was trying to reach a very large audience, many of whom have no background in science. That said, it would have been nice to read a book written for grown-ups.Overall, the book was just okay for me. Maybe it’s more exciting to those who haven’t taken an Intro to Astronomy course. If you’ve already studied Astronomy 101, however, there is nothing in either the writing or the personal opinions presented herein that qualify this as a must-read book."
277,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,5,"We humans have come a long way. From the days we were wandering the planet looking little different from our primate cousins, to these modern times where we take for granted technologies that would have been equated to magic just a century or so ago, we humans have made amazing progress. Science is what brought us here and science is what is going to help us evolve in the days ahead too. Science helped us see things as they are, dispelled our fears, gave us hope, made us discover fire and invent the wheel – two of the most important findings till today. While science may not have solved all our queries yet - and raises as many demons as it lays to rest - it makes genuine, continuous efforts to arrive at the Truth. Armed with science, we humans have started exploring all around us. From the microcosmic wonders of atoms to the mega marvels of Universe, science has lifted many veils and shown us things beyond our limited understanding. Scientists like Carl Sagan have played an important role in lifting those veils, not only by their direct contribution to the sciences, but also through their ability to communicate such esoteric wisdom to the masses, to laymen that are keen on understanding their surroundings but limited in their ability to do so.Books like ‘The Origin of Species’ remain special, not just because they tell us about groundbreaking discoveries, but also due to their telling it in a language that we, the laypersons, can understand. While ‘Cosmos’ by Carl Sagan may not be as earth-shattering as ‘The Origin of Species’, it is special by its own right. Written nearly four decades ago, co-developed with a television series of the same name, this book was produced with the idea of popularizing the sciences, especially astronomy, among the masses. To the uninitiated but curious mind, this book is the ideal beginning into the wonderous realms of the cosmos. This book is to the budding astronomer what the alphabets and the arithmetic are to the young child.From the ancient budding of scientific thoughts at the Ionian islands to the then-latest launching of space missions like Voyager-2, Carl Sagan takes each stage in the evolution of science as we know it, elaborates on the circumstances prevailing at those times, enumerates important contributions by various scientists. The real fun is his doing all this in an interesting, pacey manner, without letting the reader feel bored even once. After helping us navigate the unimaginably vast expanse of our Universe and showing us the wonders of our solar system, stars, planets, galaxies and the bleak black holes along the way, Sagan ends the book with philosophical musings on the future of mankind on this nuclear era and the possibilities of our encountering extra-terrestrial intelligence.This is not just a book on astronomy. Burgeoning with interesting details on history, evolution, atomic science and mathematics, this is one complete book that every mind passionate about learning must possess."

More so if you aren't :)Wasn't sure of picking this in 2018, thinking much of the stuff could be outdated.Well... this is evergreen!This is the story of evolution of science.

282,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365191-daniel,5,"I went into this book hoping to learn more about the Universe, and learn more I did. The chapters that dealt with star and galaxy formations were excellent, and many times I put down the book to look up something online. I had heard about a number of these topics in passing, and it was nice to read about them with more depth. For some reason, I was entranced by the concept of the 'heliopause' (look it up: it's freaking amazing), while I was outright blown away by the fact that both Voyager satellites are only a few years away from reaching this threshold of our solar system. In one of these searches, I discovered that you can subscribe to a Twitter feed for Voyager 2 that states (from a first-person POV, as if V2 is talking to you; nice) how far the satellite has traveled. According to a tweet that is one hour old (at 21:47 EST on 7/15/12), Voyager 2 was 13 hrs, 36 mins, and 44 seconds of light-travel time from Earth.One word: geekgasm.I enjoyed the historical passages, though I once again felt a massive need to branch out beyond the usual coterie of Greeks and Europeans. Sagan makes a passing reference to this cultural bias in his last chapter, stating that ""the emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western Civilization"" (281). I want to contest this statement, and the fact that I feel ill-educated to do so is evidence that I have read far more about these portions of history than any other.Sagan includes passionate passages that touch upon our birthright as a species that, ultimately, comes from ""starstuff."" Though I have heard this idea before, Sagan writes about it with a conviction that snared my sympathies anew. His point is just as poignant today as it was 32 (damn) years ago: our specie's propensity for killing each other is frightening and tragic, and the billions of dollars that governments devote to this enterprise only divert our attention and energy from pursuits that could sustain humanity on this planet, if not propel it well beyond our own stellar backyard.This book awakened another perturbing thought: I should have read about this decades ago and read further thereafter. Better now, I suppose, than never."
283,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074534-emily,1,"I have heard great things about this book and Carl Sagan for so long that I am ashamed to admit how little I liked it. I am only about 50 pages in and since I haven't been able to finish a single paragraph without skimming I'm just going to stop reading it. Cosmos is written in a casual, simple style almost like a story. To me it was way too simple and slow paced. Most of the first three chapters cover simple world setup and astronomy that I had learned about in more depth elsewhere. The book feels outdated to me though the facts are all still correct - very similar to the tv show of the same name (which we tried to watch but gave up on). I can't recommend this. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' much more and I feel like they have a similar purpose. "
284,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6515529-waqas-mhd,4,wow TMI. literally too much info. i don't know if i got everything but i really enjoyed it.
285,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22327118-felix,4,"Wow, this is pretty good. I'd never read any Sagan before reading this, nor had I seen him on television. I profess to always having been some what Sagan-illiterate. After reading this, I see why he was such an iconic figure. He had a real gift for scientific communication. Cosmos is so lucid, and really does a great job of expressing the enormity of its subject matter.However, it is often outdated. The chapters on the history of astronomy (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, etc.) are likely to be timeless. Much of what is written about our own solar system is still (to the best of my knowledge) mostly accurate. Of course, Voyager had not yet reached Uranus when this was published, so there's very little on the ice giants, for example, and we knew much less about Mars than we do now (having since visited it with a rover). And our understanding of the life cycle of stars have also (in the big picture) not changed enormously since this book was written. However, our conception of deep space has changed substantially. This book was published before dark energy / dark matter became accepted and, as such, the discussion on the expansion of the universe and the composition of deep space is very obviously dated, even in much of its basics. The final chapter on avoiding the risk of nuclear war is also less prescient in our post-Cold War present.Nevertheless, I can't not recommend this book. Sagan is an awesome nonfiction writer, and no doubt inspired countless thousands of people to pursue astronomy and physics. This shouldn't be your only stop in exploring the mysteries of the universe beyond our earth, but even if it is - well, you could do much worse."
286,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"I've seen a few people in Internet forums over the years say if there's any religion they subscribe to, it's Saganism. Obviously, it's a clever turn of phrase, but it also speaks to the fact the cosmic, scientific truths Sagan conveys here really do activate the same neural pathways of more traditional sacred experience. It's hard to walk away from any page of this book without feeling an immense sense of awe at the natural world, reverence for the universe as a whole, and a deep ethical commitment to not screw up this incredible opportunity we've been given to exist on this planet in this universe. I'm eager to read his other stuff and watch the original series now. After years of hearing so much hype about Sagan's ability to clearly communicate the inspirational wonders of scientific discovery, I was so excited to find he not just met but exceeded my high expectations."
287,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214318-roddy,5,"Stunning, beautiful prose, excellent description and metaphor, incredibly accessible. Its also one of those books where you get to see the author's own genius slip into the pages accidentally, every so often. This book is the book A Brief History of Time wants to be. Problem is, ABHOT is much more boring and high concept. Sagan is and ever will be the great teacher of the masses in my opinion. This book starts out simpler than ABHOT - here on earth. It begins with what you know and slowly expands your circle of knowledge with insightful description and simile (""the dancing of electrons with their nuclear partners across the surface of ice is like..."") Once you've got your basics, he starts taking you through the process of thinking about how it all might fit together, what scientists are currently working on (were, then working on) and thinking about. I don't hesitate to loan this to my most unscientific minded friends because its actually a great way to get them to stop thinking that stars are made from the souls of people who have died and that people just appeared on the face of the earth fully formed and wearing neckties, some 4000 years ago. Cosmos is also a very holistic book, it discusses evolution, life, the beginnings of the universe the end of the universe, the possiblity of life on other planets - and, very convincingly suggests what that might look like. It at least drives home that we have to step away from the life we are familiar with when we start theorizing what life might be like elsewhere. I can't say enough about how great this book is, how well it imbues its reader with scientific mojo, and how a book that covers textbook type material manages to be so readable. There are also (especially in the hardcover) some very pretty pictures. Note: The book cosmos was a companion/derivative of the PBS special ""Cosmos"" which Sagan worked to explain the mysteries of the universe in something like 14 episodes. You can probably buy this online if you're one of those total lamos that prefers ""the movie"". However, this movie is actually pretty awesome, albeit with very old school animations. Also Note: This book was written in the 1970s. From an outsider's perspective, physics and astrophysics (which is technically more what Cosmos is about) don't change much in 30 years, but in fact they do. Many of the theories Sagan puts forth have since proven to be quite accurate, and some, have understandably proven to be not quite accurate. Not knowing which these are won't hurt the reader; just learning how he begins his process of hypothesizing, and the idea of thinking big picture and how it all fits together is the real lesson of Cosmos. You'll need a recent astronomy or astrophysics (basic) textbook to find the plot holes though, so the recreational reader should fear not. "
288,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5120947-haritha,5,"I cannot begin to describe how amazing this book is. Of all the books I have read in my life till now, I will always remember Carl Sagan's Cosmos as the book that brought back meaning into my life. With wonderful humility, Dr. Sagan makes the unfathomably huge Cosmos come to life. His words, clearly written from the heart, are complemented by beautiful photographs and illustrations. I cannot imagine any reader being unmoved by what Dr. Sagan is telling us. As I progressed through the thirteen chapters that make this book, I went through phases of awe about how big the known Universe is, how little we know, how insignificant we are in the Cosmic scale of things, hopelessness of how petty even the biggest and most serious of international arguments (forget the minutiae of daily petty fights and grudges) are, poignancy about lost knowledge and civilizations, before I realized truly what Dr. Sagan wishes to say- human life is so, so, so, very precious. In the deafening noise of various philosophies that concern the meaning of life, Dr. Sagan's voice is the soothing balm of reason to chaffed and tired ears. This lonely planet called Earth in a forgotten corner of the Universe desperately needs more people like Dr. Sagan who can write as eloquent a book as the Cosmos. I recommend this book to each and every one. If I have kids, this book will be one they will quote as the formative book of their childhood. Carl Sagan, we miss you and you will always be my hero. "
289,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,5,"It was absolutely a stunning experience, this book is a treasure, seriously a TREASURE! It has in it almost everything you'd want to know about our universe.I won't deny that I learned a lot, and slightly appeased my eager to science, Astronomy in particular.One thing that I'd like is having the show Cosmos produced again, it would be a great opportunity to introduce ""people"" into a world of wonders."
290,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,Even after all these years (I read it for the first time ten years ago) Cosmos is still of the best science books I've ever read. 
291,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Carl Sagan's boyish enthusiasm fills this book ranging widely on scientific topics while emphasizing his life-long passion for communication with other intelligence in the universe.Like Issac Asimov, Sagan is captivated by the wonder of our physical world and eager to explain it to the general public, though Sagan ventures more into speculation while Asimov is more detail oriented - not only wanting you to know about the atom, but about the parts and the forces involved, never departing from the facts.It's impossible to read this book without finding out new things, even though it was written almost 30 years ago. For example, I did not know that our sun was formed in the company of other stars that have since dispersed across the galaxy, nor did I know that the spiral arms of our Milky Way are areas of star formation that move independently of the stars they move through. Ten million years ago the earth was within one of these spiral arms, now it is on the edge.In Cosmos, Sagan moves out from the Sun as he also takes us forward from the dawn of science. Since I've read quite a bit about the history of scientific discovery, I found the first part of this book, dealing with that subject, far less interesting than the last third where Sagan takes us off into the vastness of space, ponders the chances of life on other worlds, informs us of the weirdness of black holes, describes the life of stars and explains the possibility of another dimension that we cannot experience. He addresses the reader with respect. You feel like you are in the company of a good friend who responds to something you say with, ""yeah, I've wondered about that too and here's what I think.""Sagan has a marvelous capacity to take a subject just so far without getting bogged down in detail. There were several times I became engaged in his topic and he would carry it forward far enough for my curiosity to be satisfied. I never had that disappointing feeling of the child who says to the storytelling parent, ""but THEN what happened!?"" only to be told the story is over.The style of writing is free-flowing and natural. I don't know that I've ever sped through a book like I did this one, quickly grasping what the author has to say. There is a special kind of genius in being able to take the most abstruse subjects and present them in an understandable way. Carl Sagan writes like he was born with a pen in his hand. At the same time, his imagination is so fertile that you never can tell where he will go with a subject. His speculations about contact with another intelligence in the universe are broad and deep, this obviously being where is heart is.After closing the book, I'm impressed by how microscopic humanity is in the vastness of space and how recent we are in the immensity of time. We've only had radio for 100 years, so our electromagnetic voice has reached only 100 light years from earth, enough to get to the nearest few dozen stars, yet we are aware of, able to see through optical or radio astronomy, objects that are billions of light years from us, dating to not long after the origin of the universe.The question that hangs over this book is - are we alone? Over the billions of stars that are out there, why is there no evidence at all of intelligence elsewhere?I'm tempted to get the e-reader version of this book simply to be able to look things up easily in the future. Sagan answers so many questions, it will be easy for me to forget the answers."
292,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72985691-osama-siddique,5,"What can one say about Sagan and Cosmos that hasn't already been said. Of course I keenly devoured the show, I did have very early and deep fascination for the heavens above, and I have zealously read this one quite a few times. What Sagan has is this unique and very rare ability not just to make complex things simple, or to really bring forth and radiate the sense of awe evoked by the scale and nature of the cosmos, or a vital sense of timing and drama - of course he had all that and he was a superb scientist, teacher, presenter, actor and dramatist all rolled in one - but the unique and rare ability I want to highlight is to retain and flamboyantly convey the same deep and abiding sense of wonder, joy and excitement in the reader or the viewer as he probably felt himself the very first time he started looking for patterns in the stars. Give this book to every child, every dreamer, every would be scientist, every poet and anyone with a questioning mind. Give it also to the myopic, the dullard, the accountant and the bore. For who knows it may cure all of them. It rolls out a cosmic tapestry woven out of stars - the stuff of dreams, awe and imagination - with a master conductor and choreographer explaining the melody and rhythm of our universe. This is one of those books that you sometimes hope you had not read. Simply so that you can rediscover it and reread it and relive the thrill. Hope you are voyaging happily somewhere amongst the stars Carl. "
293,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I don't get people who find this too dry, or lacking in a sense of wonder about the world. It's full of a sense of wonder, no less potent because Sagan was agnostic (not atheist, as some people say), and he expresses this almost poetically. While some of the science is falling out of date now, it's still worth reading Cosmos -- as a primer, and for Sagan's clear explanations of how the world works, and how our understanding got to this point.I actually have the DVDs of the series as well, and while I know from seeing clips the book and the series are very similar, I'm gonna have to get round to seeing it soon. And if you've never heard of Symphony of Science, I definitely recommend it -- my favourite is 'A Glorious Dawn'.One of the things reading this really made me wonder is what Sagan would think of what we've made of the world in the last two decades. We haven't destroyed ourselves yet, but we haven't yet disarmed, we haven't even convinced everybody that climate change exists, and we still haven't gone any further from our own small planet. I wish we still had Sagan, speaking clearly and rationally about all the problems we face -- particularly because he had hope for us, as well as a warning."
294,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84821-amy,5,"I think I could categorize this book as ""life-changing"" for me. I think the reason I am interested in subjects such as classics and anthropology can be traced to this book! It's a very broad look at the history of the universe and the history of science, so even though it is a good 20+ years old, most of it still stands. Sagan writes in an engaging and accessible manner. This is definitely a great book for people who are interested in science, but a little afraid to approach a book about it. Sagan looks at the universe with awe and wonder, and he conveys these feelings to the reader."
295,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8895258-andrew-culyer,5,"There are not many books that I keep. The only ones I do keep are the ones I know I am going to read again, and this is my third time reading this.As general books about physics go, this is the best one I've ever read, and believe me, I've read a few.The subject might not appeal to a lot of people, but if you want an introduction to the cosmos, the universe, and our planet's place in it, and you don't mind having your mind opened a little bit, then I completely recommend this bookIt's going to stay on my shelf forever (or, more accurately, til the day I die)"
296,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4902544-katie,4,"I love Carl Sagan. He really does make you feel like a kid again. His excitement and enthusiasm come through clearly right from the start of this book and I'd think it would be hard for anyone not to get swept up by it. The facts and mysteries of the cosmos are fascinating especially when Carl Sagan is talking about them. There are inevitably some dry and drawn out parts,being the reason for 4 stars, but all in all fantastic. "
297,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17196555-ankit,5,I don't think I will ever encounter a better book in science genre. I urge you to read this!

299,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18782259-neeraj-adhikari,5,"Every once in a while a book you read compels you to think in a different way and broadens your perception. It leaves you somewhat different, somewhat better of a person than you were before. But rarely, very rarely, a book fundamentally alters your outlook on life and the world around you. Cosmos is such a book.Us human beings have a tendency to become complacent and indifferent as we get trapped in the humdrum rhythm of life on earth. Our minds occupied by mundane, pressing issues, we tend to forget the absurd immensity of it the cosmos - both in space and in time. This book wakes you from that slumber and takes you on a voyage from the very beginning of time to now, from the microcosm of what makes up everything to the macrocosm of everything that is. It makes you realize just how puny and insignificant, yet how remarkably special we are. We are, in Sagan's words, “starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms”Our future depends on this realization. It depends on whether we will be able to avoid self-destructing before we set on daring voyages beyond our lonely solar system. Cosmos is a book that must be read and reread, because its lessons are ones we cannot afford to forget."
300,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6075900-gayane,4,"The span of subjects in Carl Sagan's Cosmos is wide, from the history of science to (almost) modern cosmology, from the theory of evolution to interstellar flights, from creating gods to knowing our own home - Solar System. One thing you should keep in mind: I would not recommend this book to anyone with only very basic knowledge in physics. Cosmos was first published in 1980, and science has developed enormously since. There are new theories about space that correct or completely reject some of the assumptions in this book. And for those with deeper knowledge in physics there's not much to learn, but personally for me it was interesting to see what cosmology was like in 70-80s.For example, when it comes to The Big Bang and black holes I take the side of the theory of singularities. There's nothing about singularities in Cosmos. We just have to accept that we didn't know much about black holes back in 1980. That they're not completely black, that they radiate? Also, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the suggested theory that our expanding Universe can be viewed as a black hole. Nope. There were other small disagreements I had during reading but that didn't make my experience any less exciting.As for the writing, Cosmos is accessible for anyone. There's no going into equations, diagrams or whatsoever.Coming to my favourite part of the book, it has to be chapters devoted to extraterrestrial life and search for it. I just can't help it.And, if you ignore generalized or incorrect theories in the book, there are a lot of philosophical questions raised to ponder about."
301,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Quite simply—and obviously—the best popular science book ever written. Using beautiful prose, solid reasoning, historical context, philosophical power, and lavish illustrations, Sagan does an unsurpassed job conveying the mystery of the cosmos to the average reader. To be sure, some of the material is dated or has been superseded by later research, but as a snapshot of the understanding as of 1980 it is excellent. Even better, for those up-to-date with current theories and observational data, the book offers a fun way to see for yourself how science evolves itself toward better understanding, unlike some other more rigid value systems. In fact, I first read this book thirty years ago, and re-read it recently to compare with the upcoming 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey"" by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, billed as an update to Sagan's original series.Don't be afraid to read Sagan's book, all that's required is an open mind."
302,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577893-geekchick,5,"While the PBS series is dated now in its special effects, the ability of Sagan to inspire the wonderment of science and our connection with the universe is unparalleled to this day. I recommend the hardback edition, which has excellent photographs and other images. I read somewhere that Cosmos has sold more books in foreign languages than any book other than the Bible. I hope this is true. It is a book that everyone should read, and if you can watch the series, do so! (just accept the goofy effects as being a product of their age). Maybe if we all realize that we are starstuff, we would work together to save ourselves and our planet, rather than continuing on our consumeristic, capitalistic path of self destruction. Carl is king!"
303,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4,"Given that this book was published in 1980, it is naturally a bit dated. Sagan only dreams of rovers on Mars and rendezvous with comets, and is much concerned with the arms race between US and USSR.

311,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,4,"Carl Sagan's enthusiasm and passion for astronomy made Cosmos a pleasure to read. Sagan is a master at explaining astronomical concepts in layman's terms. But this book touches on not just cosmology, but also goes into the history of scientific thought and introduces the reader to some of the most influential scientists/philosophers who have contributed to man's understanding of the universe over the last 2500 years. His book also weaves in evolutionary concepts, chemistry and physics. Because Cosmos was written in the 1980's, some parts of the book are dated, but I really don't think this takes away from the overall story. It is well worth a read for someone interested in cosmology."
312,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5670472-mizzsandie,3,"I quite liked this book. Apart from Sagan’s ridicule of astrology and all things spiritual and God’ish, that is. That seemed quite counterintuitive and counterproductive, as well as close minded and prejudiced, after claiming his aim is to understand, and after he himself points out, that research needs to stay humble and open minded and to not fall into the trap of thinking it knows best.... [eyeroll]If we are made of the atoms of the universe, if there is gravity pulling planets and whole star systems and galaxies around, why not even entertain and investigate the astrological notions of humans being affected by astrological events?Because that is what’s at the base of astrology as a science, which isn’t very comparable to do with a few apparent ‘astrology’ lines in a weekly magazine. That’s like reducing math to a few basic calculations that you can do with your 10 fingers, and then ridiculing it as childish, claiming it not to be a science.Or claiming that art doesn’t exist or isn’t real, just because every child can draw, or hit a few piano keys, but not every child turns out to be an artist or a musical genius. If you claim to be a scientist, then please, at least study the complex math, astronomy and psychology behind real astrology, before you rule it out. You might want to reconsider your prejudices once you get to know the science behind it.....The same goes for spiritual notions and claims of extraterrestrial visits and messages like cropcircles that is either not even considered in the book or taken a firm stand against. Look a little deeper into it, and you will see that a lot of the explanations, views, causalities are actually both interesting and probable, and fit with many of the scienctific principles and finds that is described in this book, and so deserve a lot more attention from science than scorn. What about time- and placetravel possibilities? And maybe, just maybe, extraterrestrials ciukd have technology that they don’t have to obey the same ‘slow’ laws that we abide by? What about at least just CONSIDERING these possibilities?Maybe there is information and keys to apparent mysteries right under your noses, that the ‘scientists’ are just too arrogant to consider, and therefore they will miss out. Untill the next non-dogmatic, fearless, open minded, curious, thinker comes along and makes discoveries and deductions, and experiements, and finds new proof and open up the whole field again...Here is a possible hypotheses, that would actually help explain some of the plot holes and mysteries in the evolutionary theory that claims that EVERYTHING happens by chance [cue; eyeroll]. The hypothesis goes that extraterrestrials helped ‘seed’ the planet, and potentially has been involved throughout at certain points, watching or interacting, like scientist, and we are the experimental objects. So maybe they experimented on Earth, on us, and that helped evolution along. So then it would not ALL just be plain coincidence, some of course, as a scientist controls certain factors and let others unfold to see what happens, but there would be an intelligence at play. Adding an intelligence factor that can observe, adjust, and manipulate with the objects and the process, would explain a lot of the ‘gaps’ that evolution theories and biologist can’t fill out or wrap their minds around. Sagan actually comes very close to this idea, as he does wonder if maybe alien forces ARE already here, invisibly watching us. But then how come he hasn’t even considered the idea or made the leap that they might have been here on/off throughout the millennia, helping evolution along? And that maybe back then they interacted with us? And maybe many of the old religions and descriptions of Gods is just that; humans interacting with more advanced extraterrestrials, or Gods, as they might have perceived them to be? Worth considering and investigating if you are a true scientist, claiming to wanting to know, and not being blinded by your prejudices or what you claim to know as the Truth, I’d say.Also; a real and good scientist should be careful of their own bias and prejudice as it closes down their mind to possibilities. I liked the ties to biological, historical and sociological and psychological areas the most, as those are my main field of interests, and overall I felt enriched by reading this book and by the knowledge it presented. I only wish Sagan and other scientists would use their voice and knowledge even more to speak for Earth and humans though, and how we are headed for self-destruction if we don’t change our ways and values."
313,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3389050-sean-delauder,5,"My earliest recollections of this book are a mix of the blurred stars of the book jacket, the original airing of the PBS series, and its connection to my father. Considering I was only 3 years old at the time, this strikes me as an indication of its import. What I remember distinctly are sitting beside the couch and watching with my father as a long DNA strand stretched out across the television screen and images of the hardbound book in my father's personal library.A few years after the first run of this series on PBS, my father died. Cosmos always held a certain fascination for me, as a book, as I identified it with my father, but I never read it. Not until a few years ago. Perhaps just to see what my father saw, or to learn what brought the book and series such reverence.Oh, and what a world.Inspirational, life affirming, and filled with starry-eyed wonder, Sagan's magnum opus pleads the case for science as the preferred lens through which to see the world. Written in a time when humanity seemed to teeter on the brink of mutually assured destruction, Sagan argued for rational behavior, for the unity of humanity and absurdity of petty power struggles, for the scientific method as a way to interpret events around us rather than prominent pseudosciences (e.g., astrology) with tenets that seemed deliberately vague and arbitrary (and surprisingly easy to debunk, given their popularity), how we benefit from being skeptical, and the great potential of the human race.This book earns my unadulterated praise for building upon a philosophy that human beings can do well for themselves if they'd bother considering their ridiculous behaviors and learn how to act sensibly. The potential is there, as evinced by the leaps made by individuals throughout human history. Whether or not we choose to stand upon the shoulders of giants, or cower in their shadows, remains to be seen.I like to believe that this was a philosophy my father shared and would have taught me firsthand if he'd been around. It's a philosophy I feel I adopted anyway, and, as a result of this similarity, I want to believe in some way a bit of him is preserved in me.But don't just read the book. To get the full experience, watch the PBS series released in 1980, narrated by Sagan himself and scored by Vangelis (later known for 
Chariots of Fire
, 
The Last of the Mohicans
,and 
Blade Runner
, to name a few, but his breakthrough, and one of his best works, remains one of the themes to the 1970 French documentary on the animal kingdom, L'Apocalypse des animaux, la petite fille de la mer).There's a reason Cosmos is the most widely viewed PBS Series in the world. Beautifully stated and brilliantly scored, it tells the story of humanity, our universe, and how we fit within it.On a personal level, it is a bridge back to my father, an inspiring philosophy, a source of wonder regarding how our world might evolve if the portions of ourselves that influence what is best in us are lost, and whether or not we can avoid disaster long enough to fully realize our potential in spite of ourselves.If you can't read the book, or watch the series, do yourself a favor and, at the very least, watch this.ADDENDUM:It has come to my attention that an updated version of this landmark series will be hosted in 2014 by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson, entitled COSMOS: A SpaceTime Odyssey. The trailer shows the new version is very true to the original, with Sagan's infamous Cosmic Calendar, the spaceship of the mind, Johannes Kepler, and several other memorable moments from the 1980s series."

315,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5594063-anurag,5,"When you spot a rainbow, you point it out to people who might not be looking. When you see a shooting star flash across the sky but your friends miss it, you wish they could have seen it as well. It is in our nature to share the wonder of extraordinary experiences with others. We do it instinctively. Perhaps, we want so desperately for others to look because we know, subconsciously, that there is no way we could describe the hues of that rainbow or the awe inspired by that shooting star in our own words. I feel something similar about this book and I hope that you will read it for yourself. This book is a history of science and the culmination of one man's lifelong wonder for it. It is a paean to the fact that we are not the center of the universe, as individuals or species, and how that is in fact a beautiful thing. If nothing else, you will cherish that one lesson for long after you read this. I know I will."

If you read only one book in your lifetime, this should be that book. It covers everything: the origins of the Universe, the creation of chemical elements, formation of planets, evolution of life, the slow process humankind has gone through to discover the world and Universe, why it has taken so long to relearn what was lost in the Dark Ages, the harmful effects of religion, the reason for so many Creation myths, the possibility of other life in the Universe, the danger of nuclear war (happily, this discussion felt quite dated), and why space exploration is important.I consider myself fortunate to have seen Mr Sagan speak, on the danger of nuclear proliferation. He was a fantastic speaker; I should have known then that his books would be equally (if not more!) fantastic."
317,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11713906-eduard-gafton,5,"“Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together.” “The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.” "

In other words, it is quite outdated. Sagan is a talented writer, but I found myself tiring of his overawed tone by the later chapters. As work became significantly busier about halfway through reading this, I ended up leaving it to sit for over two weeks with just 78 pages left to read. Realistically, if I had been enjoying it more I would have found the time to finish it. If nothing else it provided a lesson in why one should not choose a book by fame alone.2/5 stars"

Sagan, in depth knowledge and passion in every area of sciences cannot go without amusing anyone. Books not only about genesis of universe but speaks very well about origins of life and evolution, hence you feel more like complete handbook of science when you read it.

327,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6824064-zhixin,5,"Cosmos is a joyous romp through space and time; genuine wonder at the beauty of galaxies, the music of spheres, the mountain of history it took to get us to the knowledge we possess about the universe today. It is not so much a science book as it is a book about everything, giving us much-needed context on the scale of things — how vast a universe measured in light years, how temporary a human lifespan, how microscopic the building blocks of matter — and how splendous the whole concoction: tiny electrical forces of push and pull holding together entire galaxies, and creating beings capable of marvelling at it all.I especially enjoyed the chapters bringing me to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and allowing me to bear witness to the birth and death of stars. Venus: a hellish place with 480°C surface temperature and 90 atmospheres of surface pressure, and an eternal rain of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere which never reaches the surface due to the high temperature. Mars: open bodies of water are impossible because the pressure is too low to keep it from boiling. Jupiter: a failed star radiating light in the infrared spectrum, big enough to contain a thousand Earths. And stars: their gravity brings particles close together for nuclear forces to overcome the natural repulsion between protons and electrons, fusing hydrogen particles together to form helium and giving off gamma photons in the process. When all the hydrogen is fused, the mass of the star determines its eventual fate into black dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. Along the way, the methods that astronomy has developed, like astronomical spectroscopy, to deduce these faraway conditions, and the expeditions — including the failures — to these planets for verification.Of noteworthy mention is Sagan’s inclusion of the process of arriving at our present conclusions, as he briefly presents a history of mistaken beliefs continuously corrected by scientific inquiry. What this serves to reinforce is the idea that what we know about the world is subject to change — but this is beautiful because we, coming later on the timeline of human civilisation, can still contribute to this giant repository of knowledge.Science is not just a pure pursuit of knowledge; it is very much affected by prevailing systems of power and beliefs. Sagan synthesizes thousands of years of (mostly Western) civilised history to present an argument for the causes of the acceleration and deceleration of the rate of scientific discovery. A great scientific boom occurred around the 5th to 6th century BC in Ionia, with the seeds of thought for a world formed not by Gods but by natural processes, the establishment of medical tradition (Hippocrates), the conception of the atom (Greek for unable to be cut), and many more, because, Sagan believes, it was comprised of a group of islands with no single concentration of power to enforce social and intellectual conformity. Diversity is the key ingredient to progress, providing a healthy cross fertilisation of ideas. Yet its reliance on the slave economy led to a lack of impetus for advancing technology, as well as an increased disdain towards manual labour, which was placed in opposition to spiritual pursuits, associated with the so-called elites. Ironically, Pythagoras and his followers, with their belief in pure theory unsullied by the world, contributed to the demise of progress, and would later influence a Christianity that suppressed free thought in order to maintain its hold on power.I found the last couple of chapters — arguments for the possibility of life elsewhere, and a warning against self-destruction through war — less satisfying than the rest of the book, as it wades into social science territory that comes off less as condensed material than as simplistic models. I raised my eyebrows at Sagan’s summary of a James W. Prescott’s findings — cultures lavishing physical affection on infants and allowing expression of sexual activity in adolescents are disinclined to violence — which Sagan proffers as the solution to world peace. While well-intentioned, it does not stand up in the strength of its argument to the rest of the book, and would perhaps have been better left as a couple of concluding paragraphs painting our possible paths: humanity annihilated through nuclear wars, versus the continued potential for awe at the worlds left for us to discover.This is a book in love with the universe; you will come off it with a renewed sense of wonder, and a growing curiosity for all things space and quantum.4.5/5"
328,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"I have read this book after having watched the (amazing!) thirteen parts documentary, so, to be honest, here's just a template to the show. In fact, I couldn't but hear Sagan's voice and picture images from the show while reading; a great testimony to how striking and enthralling 'Cosmos' is! Having said that, who doesn't like Carl Sagan? On paper or live, he truly owns it! There is something akin to childish wonders with him, and he never fails to take you in amazing journey. 'Cosmos' the book is like 'Cosmos' the documentary: a wealth of informations that leaves you thirsty for more, a true classic that goes beyond space to delve into history, biology, or, again, ecology in a breath-taking journey which is, in the end, all about us - the human drive to understand, explore, conquer. Sure, being passionate, lyric, enthusiastic, it suffers at time of wild speculations! Embracing such a wide range of topics, some are obviously also more engrossing than others, depending on your own personal likes and dislikes. But, considering this is was written about thirty years ago, it remains rich in prophecies, and, more importantly, still is relevant through and through. What else to add? Carl Sagan was one of those great mind who had the ability to fire up your imagination. 'Cosmos' is, again, one of his many books proving the point. Thrilling! "
329,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88527427-daniel-aronskind,4,"Certainly dense but once you get into a passage it’s enthralling. Some concepts were raised in ways that made me put the book down and reconsider what I’d read. Quotes:“The secrets of evolution are death and time.”“What a marvelous cooperation arrangement—plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away.”“But if the Cosmos is closed and light cannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to deceive the universe as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a black hole, look around you.”It’s also insane how stacked the 6th century BC was: “Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras in Ionia, Pharaoh Necho in Egypt, Zoroaster in Persia, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Jewish prophets in Israel, Egypt and Babylonia, and Guatama Buddha in India”."
330,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6075900-gayane,4,"The span of subjects in Carl Sagan's Cosmos is wide, from the history of science to (almost) modern cosmology, from the theory of evolution to interstellar flights, from creating gods to knowing our own home - Solar System. One thing you should keep in mind: I would not recommend this book to anyone with only very basic knowledge in physics. Cosmos was first published in 1980, and science has developed enormously since. There are new theories about space that correct or completely reject some of the assumptions in this book. And for those with deeper knowledge in physics there's not much to learn, but personally for me it was interesting to see what cosmology was like in 70-80s.For example, when it comes to The Big Bang and black holes I take the side of the theory of singularities. There's nothing about singularities in Cosmos. We just have to accept that we didn't know much about black holes back in 1980. That they're not completely black, that they radiate? Also, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the suggested theory that our expanding Universe can be viewed as a black hole. Nope. There were other small disagreements I had during reading but that didn't make my experience any less exciting.As for the writing, Cosmos is accessible for anyone. There's no going into equations, diagrams or whatsoever.Coming to my favourite part of the book, it has to be chapters devoted to extraterrestrial life and search for it. I just can't help it.And, if you ignore generalized or incorrect theories in the book, there are a lot of philosophical questions raised to ponder about."
331,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Quite simply—and obviously—the best popular science book ever written. Using beautiful prose, solid reasoning, historical context, philosophical power, and lavish illustrations, Sagan does an unsurpassed job conveying the mystery of the cosmos to the average reader. To be sure, some of the material is dated or has been superseded by later research, but as a snapshot of the understanding as of 1980 it is excellent. Even better, for those up-to-date with current theories and observational data, the book offers a fun way to see for yourself how science evolves itself toward better understanding, unlike some other more rigid value systems. In fact, I first read this book thirty years ago, and re-read it recently to compare with the upcoming 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey"" by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, billed as an update to Sagan's original series.Don't be afraid to read Sagan's book, all that's required is an open mind."
332,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577893-geekchick,5,"While the PBS series is dated now in its special effects, the ability of Sagan to inspire the wonderment of science and our connection with the universe is unparalleled to this day. I recommend the hardback edition, which has excellent photographs and other images. I read somewhere that Cosmos has sold more books in foreign languages than any book other than the Bible. I hope this is true. It is a book that everyone should read, and if you can watch the series, do so! (just accept the goofy effects as being a product of their age). Maybe if we all realize that we are starstuff, we would work together to save ourselves and our planet, rather than continuing on our consumeristic, capitalistic path of self destruction. Carl is king!"
333,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4,"Given that this book was published in 1980, it is naturally a bit dated.

But the fundamentals of astrophysics and rich history of early space exploration are still very much the way they would be described in a modern popular science book. It captures imagination and gets you excited about the universe all over again.

341,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,4,"Carl Sagan's enthusiasm and passion for astronomy made Cosmos a pleasure to read. Sagan is a master at explaining astronomical concepts in layman's terms. But this book touches on not just cosmology, but also goes into the history of scientific thought and introduces the reader to some of the most influential scientists/philosophers who have contributed to man's understanding of the universe over the last 2500 years. His book also weaves in evolutionary concepts, chemistry and physics. Because Cosmos was written in the 1980's, some parts of the book are dated, but I really don't think this takes away from the overall story. It is well worth a read for someone interested in cosmology."
342,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5670472-mizzsandie,3,"I quite liked this book. Apart from Sagan’s ridicule of astrology and all things spiritual and God’ish, that is. That seemed quite counterintuitive and counterproductive, as well as close minded and prejudiced, after claiming his aim is to understand, and after he himself points out, that research needs to stay humble and open minded and to not fall into the trap of thinking it knows best.... [eyeroll]If we are made of the atoms of the universe, if there is gravity pulling planets and whole star systems and galaxies around, why not even entertain and investigate the astrological notions of humans being affected by astrological events?Because that is what’s at the base of astrology as a science, which isn’t very comparable to do with a few apparent ‘astrology’ lines in a weekly magazine. That’s like reducing math to a few basic calculations that you can do with your 10 fingers, and then ridiculing it as childish, claiming it not to be a science.Or claiming that art doesn’t exist or isn’t real, just because every child can draw, or hit a few piano keys, but not every child turns out to be an artist or a musical genius. If you claim to be a scientist, then please, at least study the complex math, astronomy and psychology behind real astrology, before you rule it out. You might want to reconsider your prejudices once you get to know the science behind it.....The same goes for spiritual notions and claims of extraterrestrial visits and messages like cropcircles that is either not even considered in the book or taken a firm stand against. Look a little deeper into it, and you will see that a lot of the explanations, views, causalities are actually both interesting and probable, and fit with many of the scienctific principles and finds that is described in this book, and so deserve a lot more attention from science than scorn. What about time- and placetravel possibilities? And maybe, just maybe, extraterrestrials ciukd have technology that they don’t have to obey the same ‘slow’ laws that we abide by? What about at least just CONSIDERING these possibilities?Maybe there is information and keys to apparent mysteries right under your noses, that the ‘scientists’ are just too arrogant to consider, and therefore they will miss out. Untill the next non-dogmatic, fearless, open minded, curious, thinker comes along and makes discoveries and deductions, and experiements, and finds new proof and open up the whole field again...Here is a possible hypotheses, that would actually help explain some of the plot holes and mysteries in the evolutionary theory that claims that EVERYTHING happens by chance [cue; eyeroll]. The hypothesis goes that extraterrestrials helped ‘seed’ the planet, and potentially has been involved throughout at certain points, watching or interacting, like scientist, and we are the experimental objects. So maybe they experimented on Earth, on us, and that helped evolution along. So then it would not ALL just be plain coincidence, some of course, as a scientist controls certain factors and let others unfold to see what happens, but there would be an intelligence at play. Adding an intelligence factor that can observe, adjust, and manipulate with the objects and the process, would explain a lot of the ‘gaps’ that evolution theories and biologist can’t fill out or wrap their minds around. Sagan actually comes very close to this idea, as he does wonder if maybe alien forces ARE already here, invisibly watching us. But then how come he hasn’t even considered the idea or made the leap that they might have been here on/off throughout the millennia, helping evolution along? And that maybe back then they interacted with us? And maybe many of the old religions and descriptions of Gods is just that; humans interacting with more advanced extraterrestrials, or Gods, as they might have perceived them to be? Worth considering and investigating if you are a true scientist, claiming to wanting to know, and not being blinded by your prejudices or what you claim to know as the Truth, I’d say.Also; a real and good scientist should be careful of their own bias and prejudice as it closes down their mind to possibilities. I liked the ties to biological, historical and sociological and psychological areas the most, as those are my main field of interests, and overall I felt enriched by reading this book and by the knowledge it presented. I only wish Sagan and other scientists would use their voice and knowledge even more to speak for Earth and humans though, and how we are headed for self-destruction if we don’t change our ways and values."
343,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3389050-sean-delauder,5,"My earliest recollections of this book are a mix of the blurred stars of the book jacket, the original airing of the PBS series, and its connection to my father. Considering I was only 3 years old at the time, this strikes me as an indication of its import. What I remember distinctly are sitting beside the couch and watching with my father as a long DNA strand stretched out across the television screen and images of the hardbound book in my father's personal library.A few years after the first run of this series on PBS, my father died. Cosmos always held a certain fascination for me, as a book, as I identified it with my father, but I never read it. Not until a few years ago. Perhaps just to see what my father saw, or to learn what brought the book and series such reverence.Oh, and what a world.Inspirational, life affirming, and filled with starry-eyed wonder, Sagan's magnum opus pleads the case for science as the preferred lens through which to see the world. Written in a time when humanity seemed to teeter on the brink of mutually assured destruction, Sagan argued for rational behavior, for the unity of humanity and absurdity of petty power struggles, for the scientific method as a way to interpret events around us rather than prominent pseudosciences (e.g., astrology) with tenets that seemed deliberately vague and arbitrary (and surprisingly easy to debunk, given their popularity), how we benefit from being skeptical, and the great potential of the human race.This book earns my unadulterated praise for building upon a philosophy that human beings can do well for themselves if they'd bother considering their ridiculous behaviors and learn how to act sensibly. The potential is there, as evinced by the leaps made by individuals throughout human history. Whether or not we choose to stand upon the shoulders of giants, or cower in their shadows, remains to be seen.I like to believe that this was a philosophy my father shared and would have taught me firsthand if he'd been around. It's a philosophy I feel I adopted anyway, and, as a result of this similarity, I want to believe in some way a bit of him is preserved in me.But don't just read the book. To get the full experience, watch the PBS series released in 1980, narrated by Sagan himself and scored by Vangelis (later known for 
Chariots of Fire
, 
The Last of the Mohicans
,and 
Blade Runner
, to name a few, but his breakthrough, and one of his best works, remains one of the themes to the 1970 French documentary on the animal kingdom, L'Apocalypse des animaux, la petite fille de la mer).There's a reason Cosmos is the most widely viewed PBS Series in the world. Beautifully stated and brilliantly scored, it tells the story of humanity, our universe, and how we fit within it.On a personal level, it is a bridge back to my father, an inspiring philosophy, a source of wonder regarding how our world might evolve if the portions of ourselves that influence what is best in us are lost, and whether or not we can avoid disaster long enough to fully realize our potential in spite of ourselves.If you can't read the book, or watch the series, do yourself a favor and, at the very least, watch this.ADDENDUM:It has come to my attention that an updated version of this landmark series will be hosted in 2014 by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson, entitled COSMOS: A SpaceTime Odyssey. The trailer shows the new version is very true to the original, with Sagan's infamous Cosmic Calendar, the spaceship of the mind, Johannes Kepler, and several other memorable moments from the 1980s series."

345,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5594063-anurag,5,"When you spot a rainbow, you point it out to people who might not be looking. When you see a shooting star flash across the sky but your friends miss it, you wish they could have seen it as well. It is in our nature to share the wonder of extraordinary experiences with others. We do it instinctively. Perhaps, we want so desperately for others to look because we know, subconsciously, that there is no way we could describe the hues of that rainbow or the awe inspired by that shooting star in our own words. I feel something similar about this book and I hope that you will read it for yourself. This book is a history of science and the culmination of one man's lifelong wonder for it. It is a paean to the fact that we are not the center of the universe, as individuals or species, and how that is in fact a beautiful thing. If nothing else, you will cherish that one lesson for long after you read this. I know I will."

If you read only one book in your lifetime, this should be that book. It covers everything: the origins of the Universe, the creation of chemical elements, formation of planets, evolution of life, the slow process humankind has gone through to discover the world and Universe, why it has taken so long to relearn what was lost in the Dark Ages, the harmful effects of religion, the reason for so many Creation myths, the possibility of other life in the Universe, the danger of nuclear war (happily, this discussion felt quite dated), and why space exploration is important.I consider myself fortunate to have seen Mr Sagan speak, on the danger of nuclear proliferation. He was a fantastic speaker; I should have known then that his books would be equally (if not more!) fantastic."
347,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11713906-eduard-gafton,5,"“Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together.” “The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.” "
348,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32563817-douglas,2,"This would have been a great book at the time of its publication, but in 2019 it is a book about astronomy that was written a decade before the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. In other words, it is quite outdated. Sagan is a talented writer, but I found myself tiring of his overawed tone by the later chapters. As work became significantly busier about halfway through reading this, I ended up leaving it to sit for over two weeks with just 78 pages left to read. Realistically, if I had been enjoying it more I would have found the time to finish it. If nothing else it provided a lesson in why one should not choose a book by fame alone.2/5 stars"

I only heard less about Carl Sagan before I read this book, but now I can understand why he is among the best respected scholars of all time. Sagan, in depth knowledge and passion in every area of sciences cannot go without amusing anyone. Books not only about genesis of universe but speaks very well about origins of life and evolution, hence you feel more like complete handbook of science when you read it. I got glued to the book throughout, it is just fascinating as it is!A Must Read, never to be missed! "

357,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6824064-zhixin,5,"Cosmos is a joyous romp through space and time; genuine wonder at the beauty of galaxies, the music of spheres, the mountain of history it took to get us to the knowledge we possess about the universe today. It is not so much a science book as it is a book about everything, giving us much-needed context on the scale of things — how vast a universe measured in light years, how temporary a human lifespan, how microscopic the building blocks of matter — and how splendous the whole concoction: tiny electrical forces of push and pull holding together entire galaxies, and creating beings capable of marvelling at it all.I especially enjoyed the chapters bringing me to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and allowing me to bear witness to the birth and death of stars. Venus: a hellish place with 480°C surface temperature and 90 atmospheres of surface pressure, and an eternal rain of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere which never reaches the surface due to the high temperature. Mars: open bodies of water are impossible because the pressure is too low to keep it from boiling. Jupiter: a failed star radiating light in the infrared spectrum, big enough to contain a thousand Earths. And stars: their gravity brings particles close together for nuclear forces to overcome the natural repulsion between protons and electrons, fusing hydrogen particles together to form helium and giving off gamma photons in the process. When all the hydrogen is fused, the mass of the star determines its eventual fate into black dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. Along the way, the methods that astronomy has developed, like astronomical spectroscopy, to deduce these faraway conditions, and the expeditions — including the failures — to these planets for verification.Of noteworthy mention is Sagan’s inclusion of the process of arriving at our present conclusions, as he briefly presents a history of mistaken beliefs continuously corrected by scientific inquiry. What this serves to reinforce is the idea that what we know about the world is subject to change — but this is beautiful because we, coming later on the timeline of human civilisation, can still contribute to this giant repository of knowledge.Science is not just a pure pursuit of knowledge; it is very much affected by prevailing systems of power and beliefs. Sagan synthesizes thousands of years of (mostly Western) civilised history to present an argument for the causes of the acceleration and deceleration of the rate of scientific discovery. A great scientific boom occurred around the 5th to 6th century BC in Ionia, with the seeds of thought for a world formed not by Gods but by natural processes, the establishment of medical tradition (Hippocrates), the conception of the atom (Greek for unable to be cut), and many more, because, Sagan believes, it was comprised of a group of islands with no single concentration of power to enforce social and intellectual conformity. Diversity is the key ingredient to progress, providing a healthy cross fertilisation of ideas. Yet its reliance on the slave economy led to a lack of impetus for advancing technology, as well as an increased disdain towards manual labour, which was placed in opposition to spiritual pursuits, associated with the so-called elites. Ironically, Pythagoras and his followers, with their belief in pure theory unsullied by the world, contributed to the demise of progress, and would later influence a Christianity that suppressed free thought in order to maintain its hold on power.I found the last couple of chapters — arguments for the possibility of life elsewhere, and a warning against self-destruction through war — less satisfying than the rest of the book, as it wades into social science territory that comes off less as condensed material than as simplistic models. I raised my eyebrows at Sagan’s summary of a James W. Prescott’s findings — cultures lavishing physical affection on infants and allowing expression of sexual activity in adolescents are disinclined to violence — which Sagan proffers as the solution to world peace. While well-intentioned, it does not stand up in the strength of its argument to the rest of the book, and would perhaps have been better left as a couple of concluding paragraphs painting our possible paths: humanity annihilated through nuclear wars, versus the continued potential for awe at the worlds left for us to discover.This is a book in love with the universe; you will come off it with a renewed sense of wonder, and a growing curiosity for all things space and quantum.4.5/5"
358,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"I have read this book after having watched the (amazing!) thirteen parts documentary, so, to be honest, here's just a template to the show. In fact, I couldn't but hear Sagan's voice and picture images from the show while reading; a great testimony to how striking and enthralling 'Cosmos' is! Having said that, who doesn't like Carl Sagan? On paper or live, he truly owns it! There is something akin to childish wonders with him, and he never fails to take you in amazing journey. 'Cosmos' the book is like 'Cosmos' the documentary: a wealth of informations that leaves you thirsty for more, a true classic that goes beyond space to delve into history, biology, or, again, ecology in a breath-taking journey which is, in the end, all about us - the human drive to understand, explore, conquer. Sure, being passionate, lyric, enthusiastic, it suffers at time of wild speculations! Embracing such a wide range of topics, some are obviously also more engrossing than others, depending on your own personal likes and dislikes. But, considering this is was written about thirty years ago, it remains rich in prophecies, and, more importantly, still is relevant through and through. What else to add? Carl Sagan was one of those great mind who had the ability to fire up your imagination. 'Cosmos' is, again, one of his many books proving the point. Thrilling! "
359,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88527427-daniel-aronskind,4,"Certainly dense but once you get into a passage it’s enthralling. Some concepts were raised in ways that made me put the book down and reconsider what I’d read. Quotes:“The secrets of evolution are death and time.”“What a marvelous cooperation arrangement—plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away.”“But if the Cosmos is closed and light cannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to deceive the universe as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a black hole, look around you.”It’s also insane how stacked the 6th century BC was: “Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras in Ionia, Pharaoh Necho in Egypt, Zoroaster in Persia, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Jewish prophets in Israel, Egypt and Babylonia, and Guatama Buddha in India”."
360,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6075900-gayane,4,"The span of subjects in Carl Sagan's Cosmos is wide, from the history of science to (almost) modern cosmology, from the theory of evolution to interstellar flights, from creating gods to knowing our own home - Solar System. One thing you should keep in mind: I would not recommend this book to anyone with only very basic knowledge in physics. Cosmos was first published in 1980, and science has developed enormously since. There are new theories about space that correct or completely reject some of the assumptions in this book. And for those with deeper knowledge in physics there's not much to learn, but personally for me it was interesting to see what cosmology was like in 70-80s.For example, when it comes to The Big Bang and black holes I take the side of the theory of singularities. There's nothing about singularities in Cosmos. We just have to accept that we didn't know much about black holes back in 1980. That they're not completely black, that they radiate? Also, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the suggested theory that our expanding Universe can be viewed as a black hole. Nope. There were other small disagreements I had during reading but that didn't make my experience any less exciting.As for the writing, Cosmos is accessible for anyone. There's no going into equations, diagrams or whatsoever.Coming to my favourite part of the book, it has to be chapters devoted to extraterrestrial life and search for it. I just can't help it.And, if you ignore generalized or incorrect theories in the book, there are a lot of philosophical questions raised to ponder about."
361,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Quite simply—and obviously—the best popular science book ever written. Using beautiful prose, solid reasoning, historical context, philosophical power, and lavish illustrations, Sagan does an unsurpassed job conveying the mystery of the cosmos to the average reader. To be sure, some of the material is dated or has been superseded by later research, but as a snapshot of the understanding as of 1980 it is excellent. Even better, for those up-to-date with current theories and observational data, the book offers a fun way to see for yourself how science evolves itself toward better understanding, unlike some other more rigid value systems. In fact, I first read this book thirty years ago, and re-read it recently to compare with the upcoming 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey"" by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, billed as an update to Sagan's original series.Don't be afraid to read Sagan's book, all that's required is an open mind."
362,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577893-geekchick,5,"While the PBS series is dated now in its special effects, the ability of Sagan to inspire the wonderment of science and our connection with the universe is unparalleled to this day. I recommend the hardback edition, which has excellent photographs and other images. I read somewhere that Cosmos has sold more books in foreign languages than any book other than the Bible. I hope this is true. It is a book that everyone should read, and if you can watch the series, do so! (just accept the goofy effects as being a product of their age). Maybe if we all realize that we are starstuff, we would work together to save ourselves and our planet, rather than continuing on our consumeristic, capitalistic path of self destruction. Carl is king!"
363,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4,"Given that this book was published in 1980, it is naturally a bit dated. Sagan only dreams of rovers on Mars and rendezvous with comets, and is much concerned with the arms race between US and USSR. But the fundamentals of astrophysics and rich history of early space exploration are still very much the way they would be described in a modern popular science book. It captures imagination and gets you excited about the universe all over again. There certainly is value in reading classic science books today, even though we might have progressed significantly since then. "

Sagan is a master at explaining astronomical concepts in layman's terms. But this book touches on not just cosmology, but also goes into the history of scientific thought and introduces the reader to some of the most influential scientists/philosophers who have contributed to man's understanding of the universe over the last 2500 years. His book also weaves in evolutionary concepts, chemistry and physics. Because Cosmos was written in the 1980's, some parts of the book are dated, but I really don't think this takes away from the overall story. It is well worth a read for someone interested in cosmology."
372,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5670472-mizzsandie,3,"I quite liked this book. Apart from Sagan’s ridicule of astrology and all things spiritual and God’ish, that is. That seemed quite counterintuitive and counterproductive, as well as close minded and prejudiced, after claiming his aim is to understand, and after he himself points out, that research needs to stay humble and open minded and to not fall into the trap of thinking it knows best.... [eyeroll]If we are made of the atoms of the universe, if there is gravity pulling planets and whole star systems and galaxies around, why not even entertain and investigate the astrological notions of humans being affected by astrological events?Because that is what’s at the base of astrology as a science, which isn’t very comparable to do with a few apparent ‘astrology’ lines in a weekly magazine. That’s like reducing math to a few basic calculations that you can do with your 10 fingers, and then ridiculing it as childish, claiming it not to be a science.Or claiming that art doesn’t exist or isn’t real, just because every child can draw, or hit a few piano keys, but not every child turns out to be an artist or a musical genius. If you claim to be a scientist, then please, at least study the complex math, astronomy and psychology behind real astrology, before you rule it out. You might want to reconsider your prejudices once you get to know the science behind it.....The same goes for spiritual notions and claims of extraterrestrial visits and messages like cropcircles that is either not even considered in the book or taken a firm stand against. Look a little deeper into it, and you will see that a lot of the explanations, views, causalities are actually both interesting and probable, and fit with many of the scienctific principles and finds that is described in this book, and so deserve a lot more attention from science than scorn. What about time- and placetravel possibilities? And maybe, just maybe, extraterrestrials ciukd have technology that they don’t have to obey the same ‘slow’ laws that we abide by? What about at least just CONSIDERING these possibilities?Maybe there is information and keys to apparent mysteries right under your noses, that the ‘scientists’ are just too arrogant to consider, and therefore they will miss out. Untill the next non-dogmatic, fearless, open minded, curious, thinker comes along and makes discoveries and deductions, and experiements, and finds new proof and open up the whole field again...Here is a possible hypotheses, that would actually help explain some of the plot holes and mysteries in the evolutionary theory that claims that EVERYTHING happens by chance [cue; eyeroll]. The hypothesis goes that extraterrestrials helped ‘seed’ the planet, and potentially has been involved throughout at certain points, watching or interacting, like scientist, and we are the experimental objects. So maybe they experimented on Earth, on us, and that helped evolution along. So then it would not ALL just be plain coincidence, some of course, as a scientist controls certain factors and let others unfold to see what happens, but there would be an intelligence at play. Adding an intelligence factor that can observe, adjust, and manipulate with the objects and the process, would explain a lot of the ‘gaps’ that evolution theories and biologist can’t fill out or wrap their minds around. Sagan actually comes very close to this idea, as he does wonder if maybe alien forces ARE already here, invisibly watching us. But then how come he hasn’t even considered the idea or made the leap that they might have been here on/off throughout the millennia, helping evolution along? And that maybe back then they interacted with us? And maybe many of the old religions and descriptions of Gods is just that; humans interacting with more advanced extraterrestrials, or Gods, as they might have perceived them to be? Worth considering and investigating if you are a true scientist, claiming to wanting to know, and not being blinded by your prejudices or what you claim to know as the Truth, I’d say.Also; a real and good scientist should be careful of their own bias and prejudice as it closes down their mind to possibilities. I liked the ties to biological, historical and sociological and psychological areas the most, as those are my main field of interests, and overall I felt enriched by reading this book and by the knowledge it presented. I only wish Sagan and other scientists would use their voice and knowledge even more to speak for Earth and humans though, and how we are headed for self-destruction if we don’t change our ways and values."
373,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3389050-sean-delauder,5,"My earliest recollections of this book are a mix of the blurred stars of the book jacket, the original airing of the PBS series, and its connection to my father. Considering I was only 3 years old at the time, this strikes me as an indication of its import. What I remember distinctly are sitting beside the couch and watching with my father as a long DNA strand stretched out across the television screen and images of the hardbound book in my father's personal library.A few years after the first run of this series on PBS, my father died. Cosmos always held a certain fascination for me, as a book, as I identified it with my father, but I never read it. Not until a few years ago. Perhaps just to see what my father saw, or to learn what brought the book and series such reverence.Oh, and what a world.Inspirational, life affirming, and filled with starry-eyed wonder, Sagan's magnum opus pleads the case for science as the preferred lens through which to see the world. Written in a time when humanity seemed to teeter on the brink of mutually assured destruction, Sagan argued for rational behavior, for the unity of humanity and absurdity of petty power struggles, for the scientific method as a way to interpret events around us rather than prominent pseudosciences (e.g., astrology) with tenets that seemed deliberately vague and arbitrary (and surprisingly easy to debunk, given their popularity), how we benefit from being skeptical, and the great potential of the human race.This book earns my unadulterated praise for building upon a philosophy that human beings can do well for themselves if they'd bother considering their ridiculous behaviors and learn how to act sensibly. The potential is there, as evinced by the leaps made by individuals throughout human history. Whether or not we choose to stand upon the shoulders of giants, or cower in their shadows, remains to be seen.I like to believe that this was a philosophy my father shared and would have taught me firsthand if he'd been around. It's a philosophy I feel I adopted anyway, and, as a result of this similarity, I want to believe in some way a bit of him is preserved in me.But don't just read the book. To get the full experience, watch the PBS series released in 1980, narrated by Sagan himself and scored by Vangelis (later known for 
Chariots of Fire
, 
The Last of the Mohicans
,and 
Blade Runner
, to name a few, but his breakthrough, and one of his best works, remains one of the themes to the 1970 French documentary on the animal kingdom, L'Apocalypse des animaux, la petite fille de la mer).There's a reason Cosmos is the most widely viewed PBS Series in the world. Beautifully stated and brilliantly scored, it tells the story of humanity, our universe, and how we fit within it.On a personal level, it is a bridge back to my father, an inspiring philosophy, a source of wonder regarding how our world might evolve if the portions of ourselves that influence what is best in us are lost, and whether or not we can avoid disaster long enough to fully realize our potential in spite of ourselves.If you can't read the book, or watch the series, do yourself a favor and, at the very least, watch this.ADDENDUM:It has come to my attention that an updated version of this landmark series will be hosted in 2014 by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson, entitled COSMOS: A SpaceTime Odyssey. The trailer shows the new version is very true to the original, with Sagan's infamous Cosmic Calendar, the spaceship of the mind, Johannes Kepler, and several other memorable moments from the 1980s series."
374,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595746-iqra,4,"Apart from some flaws & misconceptions, i like the way, Carl described everything.Cosmos is a comprehensive book dealing with history of astronomy and evolution. It tells how matter transformed and how civilizations grew up together."
375,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5594063-anurag,5,"When you spot a rainbow, you point it out to people who might not be looking. When you see a shooting star flash across the sky but your friends miss it, you wish they could have seen it as well. It is in our nature to share the wonder of extraordinary experiences with others. We do it instinctively. Perhaps, we want so desperately for others to look because we know, subconsciously, that there is no way we could describe the hues of that rainbow or the awe inspired by that shooting star in our own words. I feel something similar about this book and I hope that you will read it for yourself. This book is a history of science and the culmination of one man's lifelong wonder for it. It is a paean to the fact that we are not the center of the universe, as individuals or species, and how that is in fact a beautiful thing. If nothing else, you will cherish that one lesson for long after you read this. I know I will."
376,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115626-nadine-jones,5,"This was absolutely amazing, and I can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading it. If you read only one book in your lifetime, this should be that book. It covers everything: the origins of the Universe, the creation of chemical elements, formation of planets, evolution of life, the slow process humankind has gone through to discover the world and Universe, why it has taken so long to relearn what was lost in the Dark Ages, the harmful effects of religion, the reason for so many Creation myths, the possibility of other life in the Universe, the danger of nuclear war (happily, this discussion felt quite dated), and why space exploration is important.I consider myself fortunate to have seen Mr Sagan speak, on the danger of nuclear proliferation. He was a fantastic speaker; I should have known then that his books would be equally (if not more!) fantastic."
377,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11713906-eduard-gafton,5,"“Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together.” “The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.” "
378,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32563817-douglas,2,"This would have been a great book at the time of its publication, but in 2019 it is a book about astronomy that was written a decade before the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. In other words, it is quite outdated. Sagan is a talented writer, but I found myself tiring of his overawed tone by the later chapters. As work became significantly busier about halfway through reading this, I ended up leaving it to sit for over two weeks with just 78 pages left to read. Realistically, if I had been enjoying it more I would have found the time to finish it. If nothing else it provided a lesson in why one should not choose a book by fame alone.2/5 stars"
379,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11732515-kuhajeyan-gunaratnam,5,"Absolutely stunning book. I only heard less about Carl Sagan before I read this book, but now I can understand why he is among the best respected scholars of all time. Sagan, in depth knowledge and passion in every area of sciences cannot go without amusing anyone. Books not only about genesis of universe but speaks very well about origins of life and evolution, hence you feel more like complete handbook of science when you read it. I got glued to the book throughout, it is just fascinating as it is!A Must Read, never to be missed! "
380,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52228684-salman-israr,0,"Brilliant as show is.Sagan's prose is magical, a journey from Big Bang to evolution of stars, planets, solar systems, life on earth,possibility of extraterristrial life to history of Homo sapiens to Moons of Mars,Saturn etc.,an enthralling voyage."
381,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,3,"This would serve as a good, albeit somewhat dated, introduction to astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology. It was written with reference to the popular 13-part television series hosted by author Sagan and would be most profitably read subsequent to a viewing. I myself saw very little of the series--perhaps only the portion on Mars."
382,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,5,"I was very young when Cosmos was aired. It made me take interest in science and influenced me to choose my path over the years. It wasn't just astronomy that I learned while watching Cosmos. It was inspiring, coaxing young minds to go out and look at the sky and imagine. Astronomy still interests me to date and the book is definitely a favorite. "
383,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32569238-jpk,2,"This is largely a book of pantheistic scripture posturing as a science textbook. The science parts are interesting; Sagan's materialistic cosmos worship seems to be a fundamental source for milennial secular humanistic belief and practice; the history is shallow, poorly understood, and anachronistic."
384,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10733384-sibylle,1,"I know it's heresy to not love Carl Sagan's Cosmos... I just really didn't. It was heralded as being so amazing, so powerful, so accessible to laymen. I found it dull. There is so much cool stuff in the universe, but this just felt like a textbook."
385,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1435375-hank-stuever,5,"I was bonkers for astronomy and planetary science in about 8th grade, when the original series ran on TV. I can still get completely absorbed by the latest news and discoveries about space. I don't believe in heaven, but I really wish and hope Carl got the grand tour."
386,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62648627-nick,5,"What an inspirational read this is! It made me keen to study, igniting a passion for reading and learning."
387,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6824064-zhixin,5,"Cosmos is a joyous romp through space and time; genuine wonder at the beauty of galaxies, the music of spheres, the mountain of history it took to get us to the knowledge we possess about the universe today. It is not so much a science book as it is a book about everything, giving us much-needed context on the scale of things — how vast a universe measured in light years, how temporary a human lifespan, how microscopic the building blocks of matter — and how splendous the whole concoction: tiny electrical forces of push and pull holding together entire galaxies, and creating beings capable of marvelling at it all.I especially enjoyed the chapters bringing me to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and allowing me to bear witness to the birth and death of stars. Venus: a hellish place with 480°C surface temperature and 90 atmospheres of surface pressure, and an eternal rain of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere which never reaches the surface due to the high temperature. Mars: open bodies of water are impossible because the pressure is too low to keep it from boiling. Jupiter: a failed star radiating light in the infrared spectrum, big enough to contain a thousand Earths. And stars: their gravity brings particles close together for nuclear forces to overcome the natural repulsion between protons and electrons, fusing hydrogen particles together to form helium and giving off gamma photons in the process. When all the hydrogen is fused, the mass of the star determines its eventual fate into black dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. Along the way, the methods that astronomy has developed, like astronomical spectroscopy, to deduce these faraway conditions, and the expeditions — including the failures — to these planets for verification.Of noteworthy mention is Sagan’s inclusion of the process of arriving at our present conclusions, as he briefly presents a history of mistaken beliefs continuously corrected by scientific inquiry. What this serves to reinforce is the idea that what we know about the world is subject to change — but this is beautiful because we, coming later on the timeline of human civilisation, can still contribute to this giant repository of knowledge.Science is not just a pure pursuit of knowledge; it is very much affected by prevailing systems of power and beliefs. Sagan synthesizes thousands of years of (mostly Western) civilised history to present an argument for the causes of the acceleration and deceleration of the rate of scientific discovery. A great scientific boom occurred around the 5th to 6th century BC in Ionia, with the seeds of thought for a world formed not by Gods but by natural processes, the establishment of medical tradition (Hippocrates), the conception of the atom (Greek for unable to be cut), and many more, because, Sagan believes, it was comprised of a group of islands with no single concentration of power to enforce social and intellectual conformity. Diversity is the key ingredient to progress, providing a healthy cross fertilisation of ideas. Yet its reliance on the slave economy led to a lack of impetus for advancing technology, as well as an increased disdain towards manual labour, which was placed in opposition to spiritual pursuits, associated with the so-called elites. Ironically, Pythagoras and his followers, with their belief in pure theory unsullied by the world, contributed to the demise of progress, and would later influence a Christianity that suppressed free thought in order to maintain its hold on power.I found the last couple of chapters — arguments for the possibility of life elsewhere, and a warning against self-destruction through war — less satisfying than the rest of the book, as it wades into social science territory that comes off less as condensed material than as simplistic models. I raised my eyebrows at Sagan’s summary of a James W. Prescott’s findings — cultures lavishing physical affection on infants and allowing expression of sexual activity in adolescents are disinclined to violence — which Sagan proffers as the solution to world peace. While well-intentioned, it does not stand up in the strength of its argument to the rest of the book, and would perhaps have been better left as a couple of concluding paragraphs painting our possible paths: humanity annihilated through nuclear wars, versus the continued potential for awe at the worlds left for us to discover.This is a book in love with the universe; you will come off it with a renewed sense of wonder, and a growing curiosity for all things space and quantum.4.5/5"
388,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"I have read this book after having watched the (amazing!) thirteen parts documentary, so, to be honest, here's just a template to the show. In fact, I couldn't but hear Sagan's voice and picture images from the show while reading; a great testimony to how striking and enthralling 'Cosmos' is! Having said that, who doesn't like Carl Sagan? On paper or live, he truly owns it! There is something akin to childish wonders with him, and he never fails to take you in amazing journey. 'Cosmos' the book is like 'Cosmos' the documentary: a wealth of informations that leaves you thirsty for more, a true classic that goes beyond space to delve into history, biology, or, again, ecology in a breath-taking journey which is, in the end, all about us - the human drive to understand, explore, conquer. Sure, being passionate, lyric, enthusiastic, it suffers at time of wild speculations! Embracing such a wide range of topics, some are obviously also more engrossing than others, depending on your own personal likes and dislikes. But, considering this is was written about thirty years ago, it remains rich in prophecies, and, more importantly, still is relevant through and through. What else to add? Carl Sagan was one of those great mind who had the ability to fire up your imagination. 'Cosmos' is, again, one of his many books proving the point. Thrilling! "
389,0375508325,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88527427-daniel-aronskind,4,"Certainly dense but once you get into a passage it’s enthralling. Some concepts were raised in ways that made me put the book down and reconsider what I’d read. Quotes:“The secrets of evolution are death and time.”“What a marvelous cooperation arrangement—plants and animals each inhaling the other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away.”“But if the Cosmos is closed and light cannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to deceive the universe as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a black hole, look around you.”It’s also insane how stacked the 6th century BC was: “Thales, Anaximander, and Pythagoras in Ionia, Pharaoh Necho in Egypt, Zoroaster in Persia, Confucius and Lao-Tse in China, Jewish prophets in Israel, Egypt and Babylonia, and Guatama Buddha in India”."
