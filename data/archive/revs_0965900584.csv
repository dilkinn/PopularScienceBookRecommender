0,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"I like to talk shit about science sometimes. Sometimes it's just to push people's buttons and other times it's because of the pop side of science is ridiculous (you know like the studies that get quoted on your web-browsers start-up page, which may even be contradicted a few days from now by some other article, or all those fucking pharmaceutical ad's on TV. Hey, thanks Pfizer for helping make me a drug addict!). I just made a slight at pop-science and that is hypocritical of me, it's really the only type of science I can understand and this book basically falls into that category, it's a watered down version of real science so humanities idiots like me can understand concepts that they would stare open mouthed at if they had to read the actual articles about. By the way, I loved this book! Starting with a seemingly simple problem (or I would think it's simple, but it took a few hundred years and Einstein to adequately understand it, apparently (not that I could figure it out) about why the water in a bucket pushes up against the side of the bucket when you spin the bucket around really fast, Brian Green creates a narrative (I'm using this in it's normal manner, not in the science as narrative way that I use it when I want to piss people off, this book is a history of science book in quite a few ways) that shows how this bucket filled with some water paved the way for Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Uncertainty, the Big Bang, String Theory, M-Theory, Branes and other concepts that helped move forward theoretical understandings of the whole universe. Oh, actually the underlying theme to the book is how do we understand the concepts of space and time, or spacetime, which is one of the problems of understanding why the water in the bucket does what it does when it is spun around. Oh, did I mention I loved this book? I feel awkward giving it five stars because I lack the critical acumen to know if Brian Green is really telling the whole story, or if there is a huge bias here because I'm an idiot when it comes to matters like this. I felt like he was being fair though but maybe I was just dazzled by any of the mathematics he would throw into footnotes that I wouldn't have the first idea on what to do with if someone handed me even the simplest one and asked me to solve it. About a hundred pages into the book I had the realization that I should have been more interested in math and science growing up. More exactly I had the realization that the way math and science were taught in the schools I attended did nothing to inspire me at all. I'm fairly certain that most people never use most of the information they learn in science classes. I've never had the need to know all the parts of a flower, but if I had been taught something about what went into discovering some of the biology of (x) or say about the real awesomeness of evolution I'd probably have perked up and gotten interested. Or maybe learned about the difficulties still facing scientists when dealing with the subatomic level, and the weirdness of quantum uncertainty and entanglement might have gotten me more interested and wanting to know more in a chemistry class than endlessly learning how to balance electrons between elements (or whatever that fruitless exercise was called). I know these details are really important to doing science, but without any reason to care about wanting to know about science this is all just monumental busy work. Shouldn't it be the job of schools to get kids to care and wanting to learn rather than forcing meaningless facts onto them? This rantish aside about the misguided importance (pedological approach?) of science education in American schools was just me being bitter. It's too late now, and I'm too dumb in too many areas of knowledge but I should have been a theoretical physicist. That is what I realized reading this book. I wish someone had told me about the weird shit these people try to figure out, explained who Parmenides was and the basic gist of his Poem was, and then told me I could work on these problems for the rest of my life if I started to pay attention in math class and gave a shit about my science classes, that there was cool stuff I'd get to later on. Parmenides is never mentioned in this book, but at almost every step through the book he kept popping into my mind. He's my reoccurring fascination. His idea of the everything just being One at first glance is so silly. I remember the first time reading Zeno's Paradoxes (he was Parmenides student) and thinking they were just silly games with words, obviously something moves faster than something else and can over come it. Obviously an arrow shot at a target eventually hits it. Duh! But sometime soon after my immediate annoyance at these kinds of meaningless games something clicked in me and I started to try to think through what Parmenides could mean by the whole universe being an unchanging, undivisible, timeless thing. A point, if you would. On one level Parmenides can be thought of as the logical foil to the pre-Socratic materialists, the voice that says your theory is nice but what about (x)? I don't buy into the idea that was Parmenides only goal though. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know exactly what Parmenides thought, because of thanks to those motherfucking Christians and Moslems (you know for their multiple burnings of the Library of Alexandria (and Christians for their wanton destruction of 'heretical' literature) we have only a scant few fragments left from Parmenides work, and most of it is second hand from the post-Socratic arch-materialist Aristotle (materialist meaning something sort of different in the Ancient Greek sense than one would think of a materialist today). Are you bored yet?Anyway, back to Parmenides, I don't buy the idea that his role was only as foil, or goad to the materialists to make their theories more logically consistent. Why? Because of Plato. Socrates is bested only twice in the dialogues. First as a young man by Parmenides of Elea (the guy I've been writing about) in Parmenides and second by the Eleatic Stranger in The Sophist and The Statesman (these two dialogues are like a part one and part two to each other). The appearance of the Eleatic Stranger is in the two dialogues that come at the end of Socrates life, before the series of dialogues that make up the trial and death of Socrates. In both instances Socrates is bested in his arguments by the philosophy coming from Elea. Why? Why is the only person who Plato allows to give Socrates a philosophical beat-down either Parmenides or a stand in for him? (Parmenides himself couldn't be in a chronologically later dialogue, since he was an old man when Socrates was a youth). Anyway, long story that doesn't mean too much to anyone probably, but to sum it up Parmenides has been an thought game for me for years now, and many of the ideas that I've had to reconcile what Parmenides means I find in this fucking book, there are people who are seriously considering some of the logical games I play in my head about cosmology, but they have math and ways of actually coming up with answers! I haven't done a good job at it, but to me this is so exciting. It's like all of the crazy shit that philosophers have thought up over the years can be actually studied and not just argued about using a mismash of concepts and logic, but possibly measured and articulated with math and shit! This book is like a validation to the stuff I think about when I'm not just wallowing in self-pity or being sad. Of course, I knew that a lot of this stuff existed before reading this book, but I had no idea what any of it really meant. I just took the words and applied common meanings to them. String Theory? Oh, everything is interconnected with vibrating strings. Actually, no. That's not what String Theory means. Multi-dimensions, you mean like people could be living in a dimension almost on top of me that I don't see because I don't have access to those dimensions, but one day maybe we could, right? No, actually even if the dimensions are big, the word big is being used on a microscopic scale, like the width of a piece of hair big, as opposed to small as in so small we have nothing that can see it. I realized that most of the ways books in the new age section use science terms to validate their ideas and how they claim to be drawing on cutting edge research is bullshit, that they are just picking terms out and using them in ways to sell books on hokum. I realized reading this book that I wish I wasn't so stupid and that I could at least understand this stuff at more than in a non-technical watered down way."
1,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"Did you know that Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect anagram of “A Second Herring Quits”? And is a near perfect anagram of “Surely someone’s taking the piss”? The second anagram relies, of course (and almost entirely), on a rather judicious application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – but I do think that one may be more illuminating of how I’m finding some of the quantum mechanical experiments described in this book. There is part of me that would like to believe that in the early part of the last century (I don’t remember the year, but surely on an April First) a group of European physicists got together and decided to come up with an idea so monumentally ridiculous that it would have them chuckling at the gullibility of we more mathematically challenged for years to come. Einstein was in on the joke at the start, but ended up thinking it had all gone on for far too long. Frynman introduced some slapstick into the equations (in a fine American tradition) – but, as always, it takes an Irishman (John Bell) to put the final touches on the comedy and to make it truly surreal. So, why isn’t anybody laughing?If you are not disturbed by the findings of Quantum Mechanics, well, you’re really not trying hard enough. This is quite some book so far.UpdateOkay, I’ve finished and I’ve had problems with this one. In fact, I have many problems with modern physics and believe that the only way I could really understand it more would be to go back and finish off a degree in this stuff. Since I’m unlikely to do that, I am going to have to accept that this stuff will have to remain a mystery to me. This guy really does try to make this stuff accessible, but I’ve a feeling that without the maths it just does not make any sense on any level.My problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that every time there is a problem in Physics we are having trouble solving we just make up something invisible to solve it. Universe not expanding fast enough? Stuff it full of dark matter. Expanding too fast? Bring back the Cosmological Constant. Can’t make gravity fit in with quantum theory? Postulate string theory. Having trouble with quantum theory? Why not create an infinite number of universes that can’t access each other. Having trouble explaining the vibrations of one dimensional strings? Vibrate them in 11 dimensional space.Bring back the Ether, I say. Physics never seems to do anything by half. Even cosmic inflation seems to have inflated the universe to a ridiculous extent in the first nanosecond of the universe.I don’t believe I can really say anything sensible about any of this stuff. It is so far divorced from my limited understanding that to express an opinion really just makes me feel incredibly ignorant. Like I said, I’m not prepared to learn the maths, so I should just shut up. It is a pity physics has become so esoteric – I would like to be one of its great defenders, to use it as a basis to understand the universe, but I come away from these books feeling someone is having me on.This is a good book, in part. Some of it is still remarkably hard going – even with the allusions to the Simpsons and X Files (I’ve never seen the X Files or some of the other bits of pop culture mentioned, so that made what I took to be some of the jokes quite inaccessible to me – but that will just be me). The stuff about Newton’s Bucket was utterly fascinating and well worth reading. The stuff of string theory was like most stuff on string theory – I’ve virtually no understanding of this stuff and can’t quite follow the controversy that surrounds it. Anyway, it sounds like no one will ever be able to test any of this stuff – if we can’t see an electron how the hell are we ever going to see a one dimensional string?My main problem with this book was his early explanation of entropy and how this did not provide an arrow of time. He says that if you watch a film of an egg falling and braking that you could reverse the film and there is nothing in the laws of physics to decide which direction the film travelled in that must be the right direction. He says that there would be a way to get all the bits of egg to fly back at the right speed and reconstitute. This, of course, is nonsense. It is not a matter of things coming back together at the right speed that is the issue. Have you ever broken a glass? You don’t get the pieces to go back together again by moving them together at the ‘right speed’. They never go back together again. This is a one way reaction. Why? Because once the glass is broken the bonds between the atoms in the glass are broken. Pushing the pieces together again is pushing negatively charged electrons against negatively charged electrons and they will repeal each other, not just nicely bond. There are laws of physics and laws of chemistry that do not allow this reversal. I figure that if I have spotted a flaw in this easy bit of his argument there are too many bits of this argument that I struggled to follow that may be just as equally flawed. (This stuff is from about page 145 – 169)I did learn some interesting stuff from this book – even about entropy. I had no idea that the arrow of entropy was double headed or that inflation was the main cause of order in the young universe. But large parts of this book deal with questions that are simply too esoteric. I ended up knowing that I would never know what was in a black hole or what caused the big bang and basically not really caring. I’m sure this wasn’t Greene’s intention, more is the pity."
2,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Wow, what a wonderful book. What a ride it was. Brian is definitely one of the best science popularisers about, hands down. It is amazing how he manages to convey potentially complex subjects, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, in a simple but at the same time rigorous manner. And he does that with a contagious enthusiasm which reminded to me why I love physics. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he never gets into the game (like so frequently happens in popular science books, unfortunately) of oversimplifying the subject. His book is very readable and he has a great gift of explaining complex subjects with an amazing clarity. While the book may be a bit too simple at times, more quantitative detail is available in the notes at the end of the book (which I strongly recommend you read, to get more detail), and bibliographic references are pretty good. It is a fantastic introductory book to the realm of contemporary physics - of course, if you are interested in more quantitative treatments of such subjects, then this is probably not the book for you - although I must say that everybody with an interest in science should really take the time to read this masterpiece. The author, being a foremost scientist directly involved in the most advanced research efforts in areas such as String Theory, does have his own preferences and biases (all honestly acknowledged by him, and also they do not impact the overall objectivity and impartiality of his book). Moreover, being particle physics an area of such intense and frantic development, there are a couple of area where the book looks a bit dated (for example, even if SUSY is not officially dead, the results coming out of the LHC are such that there is increasing doubt over the real prospects of SUSY and consequently of Super String Theories - although it is completely premature to claim that they are dead).Overall, it is an amazing introductory book, informative, entertaining, lucid, and a complete pleasure to read.

3,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709846-manuel-ant-o,2,"If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Going Overboard: ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene(original review, 2004)""Within each individual [time] slice, your thoughts and memories are sufficiently rich to yield a sense that time has continuously flowed to that moment. This feeling, this sensation that time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments—previous frames—to be ""sequentially illuminated.""﻿In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian GreeneI agree that this is at least as much philosophy as science, though mathematically based philosophy. But what irks me is that for all the pages of science books devoted to this subject, no one has pointed out that for us to experience moments sequentially (assuming those moments don't themselves move) our mind has to move through those moments. And movement entails time. So while time may be a spatial dimension, if Greene (and Godel, etc.) are right, then there must be at least one other dimension of time that allows our minds to move through the different moments that all exist and experience them sequentially.﻿"
4,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Let's start with the positives: Greene does an excellent job of explaining very hard-to-understand concepts in non-mathematical ways. That said, I think it was unecessary to use popular culture the way he did. It feels silly, reading about Einstein and general relativity and getting an example which uses the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart, and Lisa and so forth. But okay, I admit that this is a fairly small detail that shouldn't take too much away from the overall experience. The important thing is that the concepts are explained in a manner which is understandable. Does Greene do that? He does, for the most part.Furthermore, Greene is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and that is something that is contagious. Reading about the bucket argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_a...) and the various attempts at answering it; the exciting exploration of time, the arrow of time, and its mysteries; the exhilarating explanation of entropy; the outline of general relativity, quantum mechanics and a whole host of other physical theories, and on the whole Greene's passionate way of writing makes this an extremely engaging read. And the subject matter is interesting. I mean, the bending of space and time, particles being ""entangled"" (""spooky action at a distance"") through space, possible hidden dimensions, elusive particles, multiverses.. Paul Erdos said that ""if numbers aren't beautiful, I don't know what is."" Well, if this stuff isn't interesting, I don't know what is! Thus, overall, the book is extremely engaging and exciting, and it's one of those books that are very much, in many ways, unputdownable. Now, the negatives.First of all, the illustrations are almost no help, because they are of awful quality. I read the hardcover version, and even here they are small, with no colour and in fairly awful quality. Another problem with the book has been pointed out in this review as well, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... You get the impression that without the math, a lot of this just isn't really possible to convey properly. You are left with only a part of the picture. I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's words: ""To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."" Sometimes Greene is pretty frank about this. He'll essentially write, ""okay, I know this is far-fetched, but trust me on this one: the math is right, guys."" To Greene's credit, there are a lot of pages in the back of the book devoted to the more mathematically inclined reader, so that those who do get it can check it out for themselves. Now, the last negative aspect of the book is the fact that there's not a whole lot of new things here. If you've read The Elegant Universe, you don't really get a whole lot of new knowledge, except that this book is less about string theory and more about cosmology. I think it's enough to read one of them, which kind of renders this book somewhat unecessary. With all those negatives aside, the book is enjoyable and engaging. If you want some stretching exercises for your imagination, it's not a mistake to pick it up."
5,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856764-kristen,0,"I GIVE UPYou win this round science book **(shakes fist in anger)**In fact, after reading this book I've given up on science completely in favor the Nabokovian theory of very young earth creationism: The World Was Created This Morning. ""Theoretically there is no absolute proof that one's awakening in the morning (the finding oneself again in the saddle of one's personality) is not really a quite unprecedented event, a perfectly original birth."" Yeah, that does make a bit more sense than most of this book. . . . I'm starting to wish I never listed this here because if I hadn't I could give up without feeling so bad (or anyone knowing). It's not that he's a bad writer it's just that I'm not that smart, but I suppose we all have own unique talents, right? Sure, Brian Greene might understand physics but can he roll a joint while driving his car with his knee? . . . so yeah, I got that going for me at-least . . . That's something, right?"
6,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"You probably know more about physics than you think. See, right there, when your brain registered the p-word, a black hole of anxiety opened up in the pit of your stomach from which nothing can escape. Your underarms began to radiate heat as your mind conjured memories of stuffy high school laboratories. And as your eyes scanned ahead for those dreaded half-English, half-Greek words followed by an equal sign, the probability of you reading on fast approached zero.But there’s hope! Whether you realize it or not, you just visualized some of the more important natural phenomena that govern the world around us. The stomachache was space-time curvature at a point of infinite density. The sweating was a crass simulation of something known as black body radiation. And your waning interest was a metaphor for quantum non-locality. What do these words mean? It doesn’t really matter. Even complicated physical processes were surmountable — even understandable — when they were put into the context of something familiar, say, traumatic experiences of young adulthood.Without analogy and metaphor, a reader can quickly suffocate in the rarified air of the hard sciences. The task then for any science writer is to couch these concepts in colloquial terms and familiar experiences, and no one does it better than Brian Greene. His second of two books, The Fabric of the Cosmos, is a potent distillation of 200 years of discovery and an invaluable roadmap of reality that is almost impossible to get lost with, regardless of your level of scientific knowledge. It is a compelling narrative of the search for understanding that probes the boundaries of human experience. Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, is not the first to attempt such a crash course in physics history and experiment for the non-science minded, and he won’t be the last. In fact, the popularity of this breed of book has even necessitated its own genre, which has come to be known as pop-physics. Make no mistake; it is truly a difficult task to make the revolutionary ideas of hundreds of brilliant people not only digestible, but palatable in fewer than 500 pages. Since you can’t change the elements of the story — an exhaustive historical record of dozens of collaborating countries — good science writing then becomes an exercise in conversational skills, patient instruction and plenty of examples.Greene is adept at all three but his skillful employment of examples is one of the book’s greatest strengths. Throughout the text, he uses objects we experience and protagonists we can visualize to illustrate his points. The Simpsons characters, Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, and former President Bill Clinton all appear on multiple occasions and eggs, snowflakes and bowling balls all serve as props. As juvenile as this might seem, you would be surprised at how effective Greene’s methods are. At one point in the book, he tries to explain how something called the Higgs ocean — typically the focus of a Ph.D. thesis — may give particles like protons and electrons their mass. But he uses a very familiar and somewhat playful example to illustrate the point. “If [a particle] has greater difficulty accelerating through the Higgs ocean, it has a greater mass. If we liken a particle’s mass to a person’s fame, then the Higgs ocean is like the paparazzi: those who are unknown pass through the swarming photographers with ease, but famous politicians and movie stars have to push much harder to reach their destination.”While this technique of using vivid examples seems straight forward, it is actually very easy to mess up and there are a few cardinal sins that many physics authors commit. A common transgression is to sacrifice accuracy for sensationalism under the misconception that science fiction is the only way to engage the average reader. The very talented Michio Kaku of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (the same place Einstein spent the last few decades of his life) is a repeat offender. His most recent work of pop-physics, called Hyperspace, contains examples that are shamelessly unscientific at times and really underestimate the reader’s intelligence.But by no means does Greene dumb down the information in Fabric and yet, none of the underlying ideas are lost. Further, he doesn’t resort to sensationalized hypothetical situations but instead finds a creative way to make the reader appreciate real scientific results. In doing so, he makes it more than understandable. He makes the reader appreciate and even enjoy the excitement of discovery.And if Greene’s delivery of concepts is superb, his thoughtful selection of content only reinforces the readability of the text. The fundamental — and most impressive — difference between Greene and most other science writers is the breadth of the issues he addresses. Another cardinal sin for a science writer is to allow a topic’s complexity to dictate its relevance, which is just a cop out and a disservice to the reader. Gary Zukov, the author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, basically left out entire chapters of vital experimental findings because they were too tough to couch in human experience. But Greene doesn’t succumb to such temptations of writing around difficult material. He acknowledges the complexity of problematic topics and painstakingly walks the reader through the material every time.Unfortunately, some concepts will be beyond analogy and word craft and require at least a cursory digression of technicalities. As Greene puts it: “Human language is far better at capturing human experience than at expressing deep physical laws.” But what is unique about Fabric is that Greene gives the reader the option to get more technical without a loss of continuity. Throughout the text, he would broach a huge topic by putting it into historical context and discussing its relevance in the big physics picture. Often, the section would end with an ultimatum: keep reading to explore the details for a deeper understanding or skip to the next chapter with at least these implications in mind. This “choose your own adventure” organization gives the book a refreshing flexibility that is too often absent from pop-physics novels.Writing style also plays a large role in this work’s success. Richard Feynman, one of the more beloved albeit quirky physicists of the 20th century, was famous for his conversational style physics lessons. Though this made Feynman an incredibly effective educator, he was never able to write a book for want of literary chops. Fabric is such a good read because Greene buttresses the same savvy teaching techniques with an eloquent style of storytelling. Some parts are downright poetic and they uncover the easily missed romance and excitement of scientific discovery. He writes, “By deepening our understanding of the true nature of physical reality, we profoundly reconfigure our sense of ourselves and our experience of the universe.” And other parts are surprisingly suspenseful, especially for a narrative with such well-publicized plot twists. Even though most people know that Albert Einstein would propose his groundbreaking theories of relativity in the early 1900s, until Greene gets to that part of the story, this reader was genuinely concerned about the troublesome relationship between absolute space and time. (Spoiler: It all works out beautifully!)One of the more striking features of The Fabric of the Cosmos is how Greene’s enthusiasm for modern physics almost leaps off the page, making the reader wonder, if only for a second, whether or not the Large Hadron Collider will actually produce spontaneous symmetry breaking of massive scalar bosons. But that’s beside the point. To wonder about the world around us is the first step on the path to scientific discovery and Greene’s work makes it so that anyone can find the way."

Get me into anything more than general commentary, discoveries, famous names and famous theories, and I'm completely at a loss. Green is a likable and passionate author, but for readers without a physics knowledge base, his little treatise is tough going, even with all the Simpsons references. I remember the most important concepts, but the intricacies didn't stick with me. This book is best read in segments, preferably when you're completely lucid and can take notes. "
8,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17463213-j-m-hushour,5,"Being utterly unscientific (I still believe toasters toast toast by invoking thrice the name of said bread and summoning forth a kind of crisping deity), I pounce on shit for the lay reader. Sacks, Sagan, Ramachandran, Richard Simmons, etc. I had never heard of Brian Greene and have typically held physics and such things at arm's length, with my other hand pinching my nose shut as if holding the world's most curious diaper: there is probably much of interest within to parse out, but noxious enough to keep me anyway. This book was recommended to me (okay, it was a present) by a friend who seems to be aware of my constant questioning of the nature of the very fabric of reality itself. Luckily, this book squares a lot of things and sets them to rights for me.Greene is an awesome writer. He's funny and he describes this complicated shizz really well (he likes to make Simpsons analogies). There are few parts that are mind-bending to the point where I got a headache. Greene will outright warn you to skip ahead if its getting too dense, which is nice.As to the actual content? Fuck, it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I'll just say, I came out of the book feeling and sounding smarter. I can rap about three-branes, the Many Worlds hypothesis and impress my friends with my knowledge of the eleven spacetime dimensions.All-in-all, satisfying, funny, and informative."
9,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Bad book. I was looking forward to learning about cosmos themed science, something I never learned about in school. This book was not the answer to my acquisition of knowledge. In fact, I learned almost nothing from this book. The writing is awful. It seeks to explain through dense prose, repetitive text, asinine pop references and endless in text questions. It really just shows why science writers should write books for the general public, not most scientists. Further, the author is in love with his superstring research and theory, but never convinced me it actually exists. All in all, it’s hard for me to express my disgust with this book. At least my nightmare and dread of reading on with this book have come to an end. I will never read this author again and may just avoid cosmos and superstring science if there’s no better work out there. "
10,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Glancing at the reviews for Brian Greene's overview of how we view the stuff of which our universe is made, it seems that some people base their rating and opinion on how much they agree with the science, or how credible they find it. While I have read a fair few popular science books – especially in the areas of physics and cosmology, areas I find utterly fascinating and about which I am perplexed that anyone can not be astounded and beguiled – I have to assume that I am reading a fair explanation of facts and theories. That is not to say that I assume the author is more knowledgeable than me simply because he has more letters after his name, but because he grounds his claims with background and the weight of evidence that is needed for a scientific hypothesis to become a generally accepted theory. Also, I have taken the effort to educate myself in these areas so have enough grounding myself to be able to appreciate the arguments.That said, for much of this book I'm unsure how much background would be needed to understand the explanations. Greene writes with a clarity and readability which is all too rare in any field, and is particularly welcome in discussing such big ideas. As in Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, Greene completely dispenses with calculations but, unlike Hawking, he also tries to keep the use of metaphor to a minimum. It cannot, of course, be dispensed with completely – metaphors are an extraordinarily powerful descriptive tool, especially in a field that can only properly be explained and understood using specialist mathematics – but for the most part Greene simply gives an overview of each field in historical context, and explains WHY it is important, what it explains and why it works.He starts – as modern physics in so many fields must – with Isaac Newton, and particularly Newton's Bucket. If you hang a bucket of water on a rope and twist the rope, as the rope unwinds, spinning the bucket, at first the water remains stationary until the friction of the bucket's movement makes the water begin to spin. When it does, the surface becomes increasingly concave, moved outward by what why now call centripetal (or centrifugal) force. But what, asked Newton, is the water moving away from, or toward? What is it moving in relation to? He decided that it moved in relation to the fixed fabric of the cosmos, the stuff in which the matter (that he recognised as being the thing on which gravity works) sits. Recognising that he had no way of testing this medium by experiment, Newton took this is an immutable absolute and left it at that. Greene keeps returning to the bucket and its implications throughout the book, to superb explanatory effect.I won't go further into the details (read the book!), but simply say that thanks to Professor Greene I now understand areas of cosmology and physics where I had previously had to simply give in to brain cramp and accept as being true. I understand why the speed of light (actually, the speed of any electromagnetic radiation) is approx 300, 000 km/sec faster than you, no matter how fast you are travelling. I understand a whole lot more about General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and why they make sense and are such powerful tools in describing our universe. I understand that Inflationary Theory is not merely a tweak of Big Bang theory to enable it to fit observed facts, but a whole new way of looking at the growth of the universe that actually explains much more about the fundamental physics.I'm not claiming a thorough understanding of these subjects (and in some, like Brane Theory, I still found myself rather lost; a re-read may be in order), but I feel that The Fabric of the Cosmos has deepened my comprehension of and appreciation for the wonders of our universe. And for the wonders of the human mind to work out these things. In around three hundred years we have developed this system, science, as a means of examining the world around us in a way which is comprehensible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. All books on science now seem to feel the need to restate this about science; it is NOT knowledge passed down from on high by men in white coats using deliberately obfuscatory language for reasons of either professional pride or conspiracy. Science is a method that enables us to understand more and more about the world, to revel in the joy of knowing how the rainbow is formed as well as in its simple beauty. No idea in science is sacrosanct, no theory is holy. To achieve the status of acceptance of say, General Relativity or Evolution by Natural Selection, a theory has to be tested – that is, it has to survive again and again and again the onslaught of people systematically trying to prove it wrong. When a weakness is found the theory must be re-examined. Sometimes the fault will cause the foundations of the theory to crumble, and it will be discarded; it has still served a purpose, to show how promising such an approach is. Sometimes finding the errors will strengthen a theory and teach us more – Edwin Hubble's original calculations of distant galaxies seemed to show the universe to be about 1.5 billion years old, despite lots of other evidence at the time insisting it was at least 3 billion years old (as we now know, this was still almost five times too conservative). Everything else about Hubble's observation and theory made sense, there was simply an error in calculating the distance of the super novae he was using to get the figures, a correction which itself taught us much about the universe.And this is incredibly important to realise because, while many theories, however much work they take, partly make sense on an intuitive level you get to Quantum and Brane theory and they simply cannot – in fact they seem, by intuition and everyday experience, utterly ridiculous (the great physicist Nils Bor said something along the lines of “if you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory”) but they are undoubtedly right. One important way a theory is tested is to use it to make predictions in the physical world and Quantum Theory has been called far and away the most successful predictive theory in science. It is, like every successful theory, one that accurately describes the way our universe works, with the limits of perception and understanding we have, which is why theories are modified or discarded when new information comes along. Which is why General Relativity replaced Newton's Laws of Gravitation as the best description we have for how gravity works – although NASA still use Newton's calculations most of the time, for the same reason you don't need to understand Gaussian Quadratic Maths to balance your chequebook.Greene's book, the first I've read by him, shows why it is worth reading a range of books on the same (or closely connected) areas of science. While in The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinov managed to convey a sense of wonder and discovery on a par with Carl Sagan's writings (a plaudit I don't throw around lightly!), Greene has given us a book that manages a clarity and depth of explanation while being a thoroughly entertaining read. At schools, perhaps instead of training our children into narrowly defined roles, science classes should just be introducing them to the works of Greene and Hawking, Sagan and Tyson (Neil deGrasse, not Mike) and Krauss to show them how huge and wonderful and beautiful the universe is, and how much joy and fulfilment can be achieved through our efforts to understand it."

I think Brian is fantastically gifted to explain esoteric and cutting-edge cosmological concepts without the use of formulae and maths. He says himself that he will only use metaphors to explain the ideas, but even so he remains respectful of his subject, he does not dumb things down, and I found the metaphors for the most part evocative and helpful. Towards the end of the book, however, the ideas get so far removed from human intuition that I would have wanted a little more formalism, perhaps. But - this was on offer as well! Brian adds a copious body of footnotes and in this way relegates a more rigorous discussion to the back of the book. This discussion will of course still not satisfy those who have an in-depth understanding of the science involved, but I don't think they are the target group of this book in the first place. To me, this was the best account of the current state (well, it's ten years old, but close enough) of cosmology I have read. The field appears to be so fast-moving that some of his statements in the later chapters have already been overtaken by reality, but there is a special charm in hearing Brian suggest that the LIGO experiment may demonstrate the existence of gravitational waves in decades to come when you know that this has already happened, much sooner than he thought. Equally, I felt a pang of regret when he expresses optimism that the LHC runs may find evidence of extra spatial dimensions soon after the upgrade to higher energies, knowing this has not happened yet, and scepticism is mounting that it ever will.Transcending what Brian was actually teaching me about the science, I also had an epiphany when I was reading the book. Brian talks at length about the shortcomings of the Big Bang theory, and explains how the theory of inflation may answer some of its more frustrating issues, such as the flatness problem. The flatness problem highlights the issue that a tiny difference in origin conditions would have generated a universe entirely different from the one we observe today. Now, I have always thought that this is no mystery, the fact that we are here to observe this universe is the reason we may puzzle about these finetuned conditions, but they are just one in many, equally possible, universes, and our surprise is therefore of our own making. I even thought this position was enlightened, and quite clever. But Brian explained that physicists abhor theories that rely on unknown qualities, on axiomatic pronouncements that accept something as a given. I understood that only by asking ""why"" were physicists able to develop a theory that explains the finetuning, and go beyond the Big Bang as the creation theory of the universe. And this was an excellent lesson to me. I think I knew this once, but I had forgotten about it. In my case, my anthropic stance was actually an attempt on my part to avoid a deeper question, an attempt to posit an answer where there wasn't one yet. Brian reminded me that we must never stop asking ""why"", that asking ""why"" is what makes us human. I loved this book. I can only recommend it to anybody who does not have a formal degree in science and wants to learn more about cosmology but is a bit frustrated about the lack of depth popular accounts of this topic typically provide."

Greene avoids both. This is hands down the best popular intro to modern physics I've found. Even with half a B.S. in physics and formal courses on many of the topics covered, this book consistently kept my interest and taught me new things.Two unique aspects of this book I haven't found elsewhere are (1) its focus on space and time and (2) its enthusiasm. As for (1), most pop sci books on physics focus on trying to convey one or more specific theories (quantum theory, special relativity, string theory, etc) and may discuss space or time in the context of one of these theories but don't make connections between them. Greene actually makes space and time the main character of this story and follows them throughout history and across theories. As for (2), not since Richard Feynman have I found a physicist whose writing makes me shiver with childish delight at the wonders of the universe. Some might find his poetic geeky gushes cheesy, but others (like myself) will spend the next several evenings lying outside on their lawns, staring at the stars, and just basking in the awesomeness of it all.That said, don't expect a book without mathematics to convey a full picture of our current understanding of physics. Nature seems to be written most naturally in the language of mathematics and that is the language in which she must be read. Hopefully though, if you haven't gotten over a particularly frightening encounter with mathematics as a young impressionable child, this book will convince you that it's worth doing.If you:

   are interested in modern physics but don't know where to start 
   have read a few pop sci books or many pop sci articles but want to see how many of the ideas fit together 
   or curious about our past and current understanding of space and time
...then I highly recommend this book, regardless of your background."
14,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This was as very confounding book to me - not confusing but confounding. It has some amazing observations and conundrums to ponder over and I suspect I did not appreciate (or even understand all that it had to tell me).Let me explain - some of the chapters used examples - some of which I have actually studied in my years in education. For example the example where electrons can be treated as particles while at the same time be treated as waves. Now I remember the experiments and I remember the theory that went with them. But I did not associated them with the bigger picture being presented in the chapter. And so the reason why I am confounded- this book challenges many of the scientific notions, a few it takes and builds upon them often reinforcing the notions it is trying to convey. And yet reading this book I feel there is so much more to learn and understand (including some of the sections in the book itself). Ironically looking back at my education I realise that rather than trying to build a foundation for me to build upon I feel like it have been shown how little I know and how so much there is still to explore and learn.Books like this have a variety of effects on me - but this is the first to make me feel so small in the scheme of things. But rather than making it feel a negative experience its almost like a reassurance that you are part of everything and in the right place. As I have said earlier there is more to be learnt from this book - but for now I need let my mind rest as its had a bit of a work out reading these pages. "

We’re storytellers, and what could be more grand than the story of creation?” Admittedly, my head was spinning quite a bit during this read. After all, trying to understand quantum physics is something my brain just isn't wired to do.I love science, and even though volumes like this can be a task to get through, I am always left enlightened and amazed at the facts and philosophies of existence and all that it encompasses. This is not a book I would recommend if you are only wanting to be entertained, but I will say this; several times during this read I snapped out a stupor and realized I had been staring off into space, lost in those thoughts of time, space, and reality.

My only criticism is that Greene can't figure out who his audience is: there's an odd mix of esoterica and the mundane. Most of the esoteric stuff is banished to the footnotes, which are well worth reading--and I suppose I should be happy that it's there at all, since most books on modern science are written with Hawking's Editor's Law in mind: with each equation, your audience shrinks by 90%.

I guess at least now I am familiar enough with the concepts which confuse me to be able to sound like I know something about general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory over beers with friends, and that's the important thing, right?Greene uses lots of pop cultural referenced examples to illustrate difficult mathematic/theoretical constructs, so familiarity with the Simpsons, X-Files, Star Trek and Star Wars may sometimes have you thinking ""hey, I know what he's talking about"" even when you have no clue. I think some of it actually did sink in, so I'm going to recommend this to anyone who desires a primer on the advances in physics & cosmology since e=mc2 but doesn't want to read a bunch of equations."

I really enjoyed the many easy to understand explanations. Also, the book has a lot of material for the reader that even has an intermediate understanding of theoretical physics. So, it's great for a broader range of science buffs.The book covers many of the relevant theoretic physics theories. The books gives a great chronological history of physics itself.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Tkanje Svemira autora Brajana Grina / Heliks 2016 publishing / 592 pages / 159,214 words.Translation was well done."

After reading this book, you'll always have unfinished business in discovering more and more about the universe. This book is a very good intro to physics and discovering about the universe."
21,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951046-john,4,"Lots of really interesting things in this book. I didn't realize physics had progressed so far in finding a unification theory.What I found most interesting would probably horrify the author because, while he didn't say so in so many words, he apparently really believes that physics is, or can be, the answer to everything. I, on the other hand, believe there is a God, the Christian God, who has a hand in our existence.I have always thought it curious that descriptions of God or angels appearing to people seem to be accompanied by bright light and that the supernatural being just appears out of nowhere. Upon reflection this seemed to me very much like them coming out of another dimension. So, what to my surprise, some of the current notions coming out of physics is that reality consists of more dimensions than we currently are able to experience. Score one for angels appearing out of nowhere because they can move from another dimension into our 3-dimensional existence.Then there's the issue of God being omniscient, i.e. knowing everything, past, present, and future. OK, He's God, so I suppose he can know all that, but it seems kind of difficult to figure how He can know the future when it hasn't happened yet. So, what to my surprise again, I learn that physics suggests that space and time are not independent but should be considered spacetime. And (from page 452) ""that moments--the events making up the spacetime loaf--just are. They are timeless. Each moment--each event or happening--exists, just as each point in space exists."" So it appears that someone, God, for instance, who has extent in another dimension outside our spacetime, could presumably see all of our spacetime, past, present, and future. Wow!Now what about free will or agency? Christians believe that people can choose to do good or do evil and are therefore responsible for the consequences. On the other hand (from page 455), ""The laws of classical physics are deterministic. ...if you were to know precisely how things are now (the position and velocity of every particle in the universe), the laws of classical physics would tell you exactly how things were are would be at any other moment you specified. The equations are indifferent to the supposed freedom of human will."" So, according to classical physics, there is no such thing as agency or free will. But then along comes quantum theory and one view is (from page 456), ""...if the passage from probabilities to definite outcomes requires something beyond the standard quantum framework--it's at least possible that free will might find a concrete realization within physical law. We might one day find, as some physicists has speculated, that the act of conscious observation is an integral element of quantum mechanics, being the catalyst that coaxes one outcome from the quantum haze to be realized."" Greene goes on to say, ""Personally, I find this extremely unlikely, but I know of no way to rule it out."" He doesn't like it, but he has the honesty to admit that it's a possibility.Those who have faith that God exists don't, or shouldn't, need science to back Him up. But I've got to admit that it is nice when it does. Of course, as Greene points out, much of what physics proposes is theory that has not been experimentally verified. Some of the above may be supplanted in the future by other theories, but for the time being it is interesting that science seems to verify some of the attributes of God as understood by Christians."
22,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Once again, as in ""The Elegant Universe,"" Greene has done an exemplary job of presenting a ""popular"" explication of deep science (particle physics and cosmology) that is neither condescending nor watered down. I've been amazed both times than anyone could pull this off, since it's been attempted so often but left the subjects either impenetrable or eviscerated.Greene's salient attribute is clarity: He can find and present the basic contours of just about any scientific discipline in clear, disciplined, open outline. He employs several simple, elementary approaches to make this happen.• short, direct, declarative sentences: Beautiful writing with little waste.• analogy: His use of analogy to elucidate arcane concepts is spot on even when (especially when) the comparison seems initially off the wall. I can't, in any way, overestimate the worth of this ability. (Bertrand Russell made a hash of explaining relativity with a raft of confounding, muddying analogies.)• repetition: Greene presents an idea and its details from several different but complementary directions that both reinforce the underlying principles and keep them continually in mind. And he doesn't assume that once he's outlined a concept, you will automatically recall its ramifications three days later. Instead, when he refers to it again, he summarizes it quickly, as if reminding a friend walking with him down a forest path. • basic fairness: Greene has his biases (mostly in favor of string theory and its near relatives), which he never denies. But he gives full credit to the other theorists down the block, admits the failings of the theories he loves and the positive side of the others.• combining inside-outside views: Any enterprise can create a corporate worldview where what you're doing assumes a centrality that the rest of humanity might consider either scary or amusing. Greene is an insider, to different degrees, in the enterprises of mathematics, physics and string theory. Yet he does a pretty complete job of balancing the committed insider against the (more) objective outsider. He speaks equally well for himself, for the wider theoretical community, and to you, looking through the window. Greene's writing and willingness to share himself have grown since ""The Elegant Universe."" It shows most in his humor. He kept it under tight rein in the first work, but here it wanders out to laugh in the sun. ""The Simpsons"" in all their glory rollick throughout the book without apology, and the analogies often have a giggle in them that in no way limits their affect.Some of the elements I'd regretted being missed from ""The Elegant Universe"" are here in detail, in part because of the intervening half decade between publication, but I think more because that's what he's chosen here to add on. You've got dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs field (prior to the way-too-recent discovery of the Higgs boson), inflationary cosmology.I'm looking forward to reading his still more recent work."
23,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"Did Greene plagiarise a section of his book? More on that later.Oh, god, I'm surprised I finished it. For the most part, I enjoy theoretical physics. I'm not sure if I believe everything that theoretical physics proposes (but then again, I'm not one for blindly allowing myself to be pulled along by an entity I can't see), but I enjoy it nonetheless. And I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. Greene offers some thought provoking ideas, and he even mentions at one point the author of one of my favourite theoretical physics books,Lisa Randall. Unfortunately, Greene is unable to translate all his ideas into legible text. I was able to understand some of what he was saying, but after a while, my eyes started to glaze over and I was left puzzling my own existence. Greene tends to throw ideas out there (such as cracked eggs becoming whole again, or ice forming in a glass of warm water and then melting once more) without giving a warning, that leaves the reader wondering if perhaps Greene has lost his marbles in the search for truth. Furthermore, and this may be more a publisher's error, but the book promised discussion on black holes and the like- my favourite of all astronomical topics. However, black holes are only mentioned in depth in the last twenty odd pages. However, there was a chapter on time travel, wormholes and alternate universes, but that was only a short chapter in of itself.There was one segment I did catch that made me sit up and laugh. I only would have caught it because I read Flash Forward by Richard J. Sawyer shortly before this book. Greene and Sawyer both use the same analogy of Gone With the Wind as a way of describing looking through time, in exactly the same manner. Seeing as Sawyer wrote his novel first (back in 1999) and The Fabric of the Cosmos was written in 2004, I can only suspect that Greene was, er, inspired if you will to use it. Still, I'm sure Sawyer would appreciate the credit."
24,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Periodically I get inspired to read big science books aimed at clarifying things to laypeople without any maths. Generally, each time I get slightly further than I did the previous time before eventually losing focus and coasting to the end. This was one of those times. Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.Anyway. Some notes I took:The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!Maxwell/EinsteinMaxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.Quantum MechanicsLight tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.Part 2 - TimeTalks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.Quantum Mechanics + time.If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.CosmologyHubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of Back to the Future.Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. "

I can't. Physics is too hard for me. However, Brian Greene is a brilliant man with a teacher's magic talent of sussing out how to simplify and explain difficult complexities of scientific thought.

Gentle reader, I highly recommend this book.Physics is not only about observations and experiments, it is mostly about interpreting horribly complicated maths. Fortunately, Brian Greene leaves the math for the 'Notes' section in the back of this book while describing through analogies and simple-as-possible, and logical, well-written historical vignettes about the key physics discoveries by famous physicists which illuminate the nature of space and time. Each step of increasing scientific knowledge important to cosmology is described in a logical procession of conclusions, facts and theories, chapter by chapter. I finally understood many much briefer and out-of-context explanations in science articles which I have occasionally read. (However, I think I will not remember much of this enlightenment in a few weeks, alas.)The newest theories and guesses, described in chapters 12-16, about three-branes and brane splats, extra dimensions, string theory holograms, super-symmetry particle spinning, potential energy bowls, free will (yes, I said free will), five-string theories, two 'Big Bang' theories, and loop quantum gravity, by these genius scientists are the hardest of all to understand by this ordinary mortal, gentle reader, but perseverance with 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' DID make a small collapse of probabilities in the jittering mass of my excited brain particles so that this cat was radiant with more intelligence upon exiting the ebook. Unfortunately, though, I have a feeling this enlightenment is but a moon's dim reflective glow, gone as soon as the sun rises."
26,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is a nice overview of modern physics, including implications of relativity (specific and general), quantum mechanics and string theory, together with a discussion of the implications for cosmology. Some of the interesting items discussed here include the notion that during the ""Planck time"", ie, 10^(-34) sec or so after the Big Bang, space and time had no meaning, that our 3-D universe may be only an illusion of an underlying 11-dimensional universe, and reality may be coded in a cosmic ""hologram"", and that our universe may be only a minor dot in an incomparably vaster ""multiverse"".My own objection to this book is that most of this material has been written elsewhere -- for starters, Greene's earlier book ""The Elegant Universe"" was an excellent introduction to string theory and its implications. That's a problem with writing a great book -- it's hard to match the same level of excitement in the next book.The other criticism that one might raise is that string theory and the multiverse, in particular, remain highly controversial in the field. Indeed, some scientists (such as Lee Smolin) are saying out loud that string theory has been given too much rope for too long, and it is time to face the reality that it has not produced any crisp, testable hypotheses (nor is it likely to for a while). For the same reasons, many are opposed to the notion of the ""multiverse"", not just for technical reasons but also for philosophical reasons -- how can the hypothesis of an infinity of companion universes, whose existence can only be indirectly suggested, even in principle, qualify as empirical science?"
27,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel,5,"The book focused mainly on the concepts of space and time, and how they build the universe around us. Starting with the concept of space and how that's changed over the years, then time and how that's changed and now the concept of spacetime, and then the universe itself. A large part of the book was used trying to explain, ""time's arrow"" why things go forward but never backwards, why entropy is always greater in the future and never the past. It was all very interesting. At times I did get a bit lost, though not that often, but I feel now I have a much better understanding of a lot of modern physics concepts and ideas, for example I know understand Pbranes user name! I never really understood the big bang, that the universe was expanding, not that things were just getting flung further out into space. I think inflationary cosmology is neat. (even if it doesn't tie everything together). The chapter I enjoyed the most I think had to be looking at the teleportation and possibilities of time travel in the future. It was definitely more on the what if end of physics, but it was very interesting and I really enjoyed his explanations for why there would be no paradox. But it's definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in learning how the universe might work, and how in a lot of ways it does. It made a nice change for me to read a book about a subject I know so little about. While I cannot therefore give an expert opinion about it's accuracy, it was fascinating and I feel like I understand the world a lot more now."
28,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-ivan-vukovi,5,"This is as fine (or very near) as popular physics goes. Although the book is maybe a bit too simple at times, I really enjoyed how Greene is able to present some very difficult concepts by gradually building up ideas. Instead of jumping over here and over there, he leads the reader in a very precise (well, as precise as you can get without serious mathematics) and logical manner which seems to be satisfying both to the layman and to the expert. Excellent!"

30,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"I like to talk shit about science sometimes. Sometimes it's just to push people's buttons and other times it's because of the pop side of science is ridiculous (you know like the studies that get quoted on your web-browsers start-up page, which may even be contradicted a few days from now by some other article, or all those fucking pharmaceutical ad's on TV. Hey, thanks Pfizer for helping make me a drug addict!). I just made a slight at pop-science and that is hypocritical of me, it's really the only type of science I can understand and this book basically falls into that category, it's a watered down version of real science so humanities idiots like me can understand concepts that they would stare open mouthed at if they had to read the actual articles about. By the way, I loved this book! Starting with a seemingly simple problem (or I would think it's simple, but it took a few hundred years and Einstein to adequately understand it, apparently (not that I could figure it out) about why the water in a bucket pushes up against the side of the bucket when you spin the bucket around really fast, Brian Green creates a narrative (I'm using this in it's normal manner, not in the science as narrative way that I use it when I want to piss people off, this book is a history of science book in quite a few ways) that shows how this bucket filled with some water paved the way for Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Uncertainty, the Big Bang, String Theory, M-Theory, Branes and other concepts that helped move forward theoretical understandings of the whole universe. Oh, actually the underlying theme to the book is how do we understand the concepts of space and time, or spacetime, which is one of the problems of understanding why the water in the bucket does what it does when it is spun around. Oh, did I mention I loved this book? I feel awkward giving it five stars because I lack the critical acumen to know if Brian Green is really telling the whole story, or if there is a huge bias here because I'm an idiot when it comes to matters like this. I felt like he was being fair though but maybe I was just dazzled by any of the mathematics he would throw into footnotes that I wouldn't have the first idea on what to do with if someone handed me even the simplest one and asked me to solve it. About a hundred pages into the book I had the realization that I should have been more interested in math and science growing up. More exactly I had the realization that the way math and science were taught in the schools I attended did nothing to inspire me at all. I'm fairly certain that most people never use most of the information they learn in science classes. I've never had the need to know all the parts of a flower, but if I had been taught something about what went into discovering some of the biology of (x) or say about the real awesomeness of evolution I'd probably have perked up and gotten interested. Or maybe learned about the difficulties still facing scientists when dealing with the subatomic level, and the weirdness of quantum uncertainty and entanglement might have gotten me more interested and wanting to know more in a chemistry class than endlessly learning how to balance electrons between elements (or whatever that fruitless exercise was called). I know these details are really important to doing science, but without any reason to care about wanting to know about science this is all just monumental busy work. Shouldn't it be the job of schools to get kids to care and wanting to learn rather than forcing meaningless facts onto them? This rantish aside about the misguided importance (pedological approach?) of science education in American schools was just me being bitter. It's too late now, and I'm too dumb in too many areas of knowledge but I should have been a theoretical physicist. That is what I realized reading this book. I wish someone had told me about the weird shit these people try to figure out, explained who Parmenides was and the basic gist of his Poem was, and then told me I could work on these problems for the rest of my life if I started to pay attention in math class and gave a shit about my science classes, that there was cool stuff I'd get to later on. Parmenides is never mentioned in this book, but at almost every step through the book he kept popping into my mind. He's my reoccurring fascination. His idea of the everything just being One at first glance is so silly. I remember the first time reading Zeno's Paradoxes (he was Parmenides student) and thinking they were just silly games with words, obviously something moves faster than something else and can over come it. Obviously an arrow shot at a target eventually hits it. Duh! But sometime soon after my immediate annoyance at these kinds of meaningless games something clicked in me and I started to try to think through what Parmenides could mean by the whole universe being an unchanging, undivisible, timeless thing. A point, if you would. On one level Parmenides can be thought of as the logical foil to the pre-Socratic materialists, the voice that says your theory is nice but what about (x)? I don't buy into the idea that was Parmenides only goal though. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know exactly what Parmenides thought, because of thanks to those motherfucking Christians and Moslems (you know for their multiple burnings of the Library of Alexandria (and Christians for their wanton destruction of 'heretical' literature) we have only a scant few fragments left from Parmenides work, and most of it is second hand from the post-Socratic arch-materialist Aristotle (materialist meaning something sort of different in the Ancient Greek sense than one would think of a materialist today). Are you bored yet?Anyway, back to Parmenides, I don't buy the idea that his role was only as foil, or goad to the materialists to make their theories more logically consistent. Why? Because of Plato. Socrates is bested only twice in the dialogues. First as a young man by Parmenides of Elea (the guy I've been writing about) in Parmenides and second by the Eleatic Stranger in The Sophist and The Statesman (these two dialogues are like a part one and part two to each other). The appearance of the Eleatic Stranger is in the two dialogues that come at the end of Socrates life, before the series of dialogues that make up the trial and death of Socrates. In both instances Socrates is bested in his arguments by the philosophy coming from Elea. Why? Why is the only person who Plato allows to give Socrates a philosophical beat-down either Parmenides or a stand in for him? (Parmenides himself couldn't be in a chronologically later dialogue, since he was an old man when Socrates was a youth). Anyway, long story that doesn't mean too much to anyone probably, but to sum it up Parmenides has been an thought game for me for years now, and many of the ideas that I've had to reconcile what Parmenides means I find in this fucking book, there are people who are seriously considering some of the logical games I play in my head about cosmology, but they have math and ways of actually coming up with answers! I haven't done a good job at it, but to me this is so exciting. It's like all of the crazy shit that philosophers have thought up over the years can be actually studied and not just argued about using a mismash of concepts and logic, but possibly measured and articulated with math and shit! This book is like a validation to the stuff I think about when I'm not just wallowing in self-pity or being sad. Of course, I knew that a lot of this stuff existed before reading this book, but I had no idea what any of it really meant. I just took the words and applied common meanings to them. String Theory? Oh, everything is interconnected with vibrating strings. Actually, no. That's not what String Theory means. Multi-dimensions, you mean like people could be living in a dimension almost on top of me that I don't see because I don't have access to those dimensions, but one day maybe we could, right? No, actually even if the dimensions are big, the word big is being used on a microscopic scale, like the width of a piece of hair big, as opposed to small as in so small we have nothing that can see it. I realized that most of the ways books in the new age section use science terms to validate their ideas and how they claim to be drawing on cutting edge research is bullshit, that they are just picking terms out and using them in ways to sell books on hokum. I realized reading this book that I wish I wasn't so stupid and that I could at least understand this stuff at more than in a non-technical watered down way."
31,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"Did you know that Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect anagram of “A Second Herring Quits”? And is a near perfect anagram of “Surely someone’s taking the piss”? The second anagram relies, of course (and almost entirely), on a rather judicious application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – but I do think that one may be more illuminating of how I’m finding some of the quantum mechanical experiments described in this book. There is part of me that would like to believe that in the early part of the last century (I don’t remember the year, but surely on an April First) a group of European physicists got together and decided to come up with an idea so monumentally ridiculous that it would have them chuckling at the gullibility of we more mathematically challenged for years to come. Einstein was in on the joke at the start, but ended up thinking it had all gone on for far too long. Frynman introduced some slapstick into the equations (in a fine American tradition) – but, as always, it takes an Irishman (John Bell) to put the final touches on the comedy and to make it truly surreal. So, why isn’t anybody laughing?If you are not disturbed by the findings of Quantum Mechanics, well, you’re really not trying hard enough. This is quite some book so far.UpdateOkay, I’ve finished and I’ve had problems with this one. In fact, I have many problems with modern physics and believe that the only way I could really understand it more would be to go back and finish off a degree in this stuff. Since I’m unlikely to do that, I am going to have to accept that this stuff will have to remain a mystery to me. This guy really does try to make this stuff accessible, but I’ve a feeling that without the maths it just does not make any sense on any level.My problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that every time there is a problem in Physics we are having trouble solving we just make up something invisible to solve it. Universe not expanding fast enough? Stuff it full of dark matter. Expanding too fast? Bring back the Cosmological Constant. Can’t make gravity fit in with quantum theory? Postulate string theory. Having trouble with quantum theory? Why not create an infinite number of universes that can’t access each other. Having trouble explaining the vibrations of one dimensional strings? Vibrate them in 11 dimensional space.Bring back the Ether, I say. Physics never seems to do anything by half. Even cosmic inflation seems to have inflated the universe to a ridiculous extent in the first nanosecond of the universe.I don’t believe I can really say anything sensible about any of this stuff. It is so far divorced from my limited understanding that to express an opinion really just makes me feel incredibly ignorant. Like I said, I’m not prepared to learn the maths, so I should just shut up. It is a pity physics has become so esoteric – I would like to be one of its great defenders, to use it as a basis to understand the universe, but I come away from these books feeling someone is having me on.This is a good book, in part. Some of it is still remarkably hard going – even with the allusions to the Simpsons and X Files (I’ve never seen the X Files or some of the other bits of pop culture mentioned, so that made what I took to be some of the jokes quite inaccessible to me – but that will just be me). The stuff about Newton’s Bucket was utterly fascinating and well worth reading. The stuff of string theory was like most stuff on string theory – I’ve virtually no understanding of this stuff and can’t quite follow the controversy that surrounds it. Anyway, it sounds like no one will ever be able to test any of this stuff – if we can’t see an electron how the hell are we ever going to see a one dimensional string?My main problem with this book was his early explanation of entropy and how this did not provide an arrow of time. He says that if you watch a film of an egg falling and braking that you could reverse the film and there is nothing in the laws of physics to decide which direction the film travelled in that must be the right direction. He says that there would be a way to get all the bits of egg to fly back at the right speed and reconstitute. This, of course, is nonsense. It is not a matter of things coming back together at the right speed that is the issue. Have you ever broken a glass? You don’t get the pieces to go back together again by moving them together at the ‘right speed’. They never go back together again. This is a one way reaction. Why? Because once the glass is broken the bonds between the atoms in the glass are broken. Pushing the pieces together again is pushing negatively charged electrons against negatively charged electrons and they will repeal each other, not just nicely bond. There are laws of physics and laws of chemistry that do not allow this reversal. I figure that if I have spotted a flaw in this easy bit of his argument there are too many bits of this argument that I struggled to follow that may be just as equally flawed. (This stuff is from about page 145 – 169)I did learn some interesting stuff from this book – even about entropy. I had no idea that the arrow of entropy was double headed or that inflation was the main cause of order in the young universe. But large parts of this book deal with questions that are simply too esoteric. I ended up knowing that I would never know what was in a black hole or what caused the big bang and basically not really caring. I’m sure this wasn’t Greene’s intention, more is the pity."
32,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Wow, what a wonderful book. What a ride it was. Brian is definitely one of the best science popularisers about, hands down. It is amazing how he manages to convey potentially complex subjects, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, in a simple but at the same time rigorous manner. And he does that with a contagious enthusiasm which reminded to me why I love physics. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he never gets into the game (like so frequently happens in popular science books, unfortunately) of oversimplifying the subject. His book is very readable and he has a great gift of explaining complex subjects with an amazing clarity. While the book may be a bit too simple at times, more quantitative detail is available in the notes at the end of the book (which I strongly recommend you read, to get more detail), and bibliographic references are pretty good. It is a fantastic introductory book to the realm of contemporary physics - of course, if you are interested in more quantitative treatments of such subjects, then this is probably not the book for you - although I must say that everybody with an interest in science should really take the time to read this masterpiece. The author, being a foremost scientist directly involved in the most advanced research efforts in areas such as String Theory, does have his own preferences and biases (all honestly acknowledged by him, and also they do not impact the overall objectivity and impartiality of his book). Moreover, being particle physics an area of such intense and frantic development, there are a couple of area where the book looks a bit dated (for example, even if SUSY is not officially dead, the results coming out of the LHC are such that there is increasing doubt over the real prospects of SUSY and consequently of Super String Theories - although it is completely premature to claim that they are dead).Overall, it is an amazing introductory book, informative, entertaining, lucid, and a complete pleasure to read.

This feeling, this sensation that time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments—previous frames—to be ""sequentially illuminated.""﻿In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian GreeneI agree that this is at least as much philosophy as science, though mathematically based philosophy. But what irks me is that for all the pages of science books devoted to this subject, no one has pointed out that for us to experience moments sequentially (assuming those moments don't themselves move) our mind has to move through those moments. And movement entails time. So while time may be a spatial dimension, if Greene (and Godel, etc.) are right, then there must be at least one other dimension of time that allows our minds to move through the different moments that all exist and experience them sequentially.﻿"
34,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Let's start with the positives: Greene does an excellent job of explaining very hard-to-understand concepts in non-mathematical ways. That said, I think it was unecessary to use popular culture the way he did. It feels silly, reading about Einstein and general relativity and getting an example which uses the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart, and Lisa and so forth. But okay, I admit that this is a fairly small detail that shouldn't take too much away from the overall experience. The important thing is that the concepts are explained in a manner which is understandable. Does Greene do that? He does, for the most part.Furthermore, Greene is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and that is something that is contagious. Reading about the bucket argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_a...) and the various attempts at answering it; the exciting exploration of time, the arrow of time, and its mysteries; the exhilarating explanation of entropy; the outline of general relativity, quantum mechanics and a whole host of other physical theories, and on the whole Greene's passionate way of writing makes this an extremely engaging read. And the subject matter is interesting. I mean, the bending of space and time, particles being ""entangled"" (""spooky action at a distance"") through space, possible hidden dimensions, elusive particles, multiverses.. Paul Erdos said that ""if numbers aren't beautiful, I don't know what is."" Well, if this stuff isn't interesting, I don't know what is! Thus, overall, the book is extremely engaging and exciting, and it's one of those books that are very much, in many ways, unputdownable. Now, the negatives.First of all, the illustrations are almost no help, because they are of awful quality. I read the hardcover version, and even here they are small, with no colour and in fairly awful quality. Another problem with the book has been pointed out in this review as well, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... You get the impression that without the math, a lot of this just isn't really possible to convey properly. You are left with only a part of the picture. I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's words: ""To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."" Sometimes Greene is pretty frank about this. He'll essentially write, ""okay, I know this is far-fetched, but trust me on this one: the math is right, guys."" To Greene's credit, there are a lot of pages in the back of the book devoted to the more mathematically inclined reader, so that those who do get it can check it out for themselves. Now, the last negative aspect of the book is the fact that there's not a whole lot of new things here. If you've read The Elegant Universe, you don't really get a whole lot of new knowledge, except that this book is less about string theory and more about cosmology. I think it's enough to read one of them, which kind of renders this book somewhat unecessary. With all those negatives aside, the book is enjoyable and engaging. If you want some stretching exercises for your imagination, it's not a mistake to pick it up."

""Theoretically there is no absolute proof that one's awakening in the morning (the finding oneself again in the saddle of one's personality) is not really a quite unprecedented event, a perfectly original birth.""

36,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"You probably know more about physics than you think. See, right there, when your brain registered the p-word, a black hole of anxiety opened up in the pit of your stomach from which nothing can escape. Your underarms began to radiate heat as your mind conjured memories of stuffy high school laboratories. And as your eyes scanned ahead for those dreaded half-English, half-Greek words followed by an equal sign, the probability of you reading on fast approached zero.But there’s hope! Whether you realize it or not, you just visualized some of the more important natural phenomena that govern the world around us. The stomachache was space-time curvature at a point of infinite density. The sweating was a crass simulation of something known as black body radiation. And your waning interest was a metaphor for quantum non-locality. What do these words mean? It doesn’t really matter. Even complicated physical processes were surmountable — even understandable — when they were put into the context of something familiar, say, traumatic experiences of young adulthood.Without analogy and metaphor, a reader can quickly suffocate in the rarified air of the hard sciences. The task then for any science writer is to couch these concepts in colloquial terms and familiar experiences, and no one does it better than Brian Greene. His second of two books, The Fabric of the Cosmos, is a potent distillation of 200 years of discovery and an invaluable roadmap of reality that is almost impossible to get lost with, regardless of your level of scientific knowledge. It is a compelling narrative of the search for understanding that probes the boundaries of human experience. Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, is not the first to attempt such a crash course in physics history and experiment for the non-science minded, and he won’t be the last. In fact, the popularity of this breed of book has even necessitated its own genre, which has come to be known as pop-physics. Make no mistake; it is truly a difficult task to make the revolutionary ideas of hundreds of brilliant people not only digestible, but palatable in fewer than 500 pages. Since you can’t change the elements of the story — an exhaustive historical record of dozens of collaborating countries — good science writing then becomes an exercise in conversational skills, patient instruction and plenty of examples.Greene is adept at all three but his skillful employment of examples is one of the book’s greatest strengths. Throughout the text, he uses objects we experience and protagonists we can visualize to illustrate his points. The Simpsons characters, Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, and former President Bill Clinton all appear on multiple occasions and eggs, snowflakes and bowling balls all serve as props. As juvenile as this might seem, you would be surprised at how effective Greene’s methods are. At one point in the book, he tries to explain how something called the Higgs ocean — typically the focus of a Ph.D. thesis — may give particles like protons and electrons their mass. But he uses a very familiar and somewhat playful example to illustrate the point. “If [a particle] has greater difficulty accelerating through the Higgs ocean, it has a greater mass. If we liken a particle’s mass to a person’s fame, then the Higgs ocean is like the paparazzi: those who are unknown pass through the swarming photographers with ease, but famous politicians and movie stars have to push much harder to reach their destination.”While this technique of using vivid examples seems straight forward, it is actually very easy to mess up and there are a few cardinal sins that many physics authors commit. A common transgression is to sacrifice accuracy for sensationalism under the misconception that science fiction is the only way to engage the average reader. The very talented Michio Kaku of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (the same place Einstein spent the last few decades of his life) is a repeat offender. His most recent work of pop-physics, called Hyperspace, contains examples that are shamelessly unscientific at times and really underestimate the reader’s intelligence.But by no means does Greene dumb down the information in Fabric and yet, none of the underlying ideas are lost. Further, he doesn’t resort to sensationalized hypothetical situations but instead finds a creative way to make the reader appreciate real scientific results. In doing so, he makes it more than understandable. He makes the reader appreciate and even enjoy the excitement of discovery.And if Greene’s delivery of concepts is superb, his thoughtful selection of content only reinforces the readability of the text. The fundamental — and most impressive — difference between Greene and most other science writers is the breadth of the issues he addresses. Another cardinal sin for a science writer is to allow a topic’s complexity to dictate its relevance, which is just a cop out and a disservice to the reader. Gary Zukov, the author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, basically left out entire chapters of vital experimental findings because they were too tough to couch in human experience. But Greene doesn’t succumb to such temptations of writing around difficult material. He acknowledges the complexity of problematic topics and painstakingly walks the reader through the material every time.Unfortunately, some concepts will be beyond analogy and word craft and require at least a cursory digression of technicalities. As Greene puts it: “Human language is far better at capturing human experience than at expressing deep physical laws.” But what is unique about Fabric is that Greene gives the reader the option to get more technical without a loss of continuity. Throughout the text, he would broach a huge topic by putting it into historical context and discussing its relevance in the big physics picture. Often, the section would end with an ultimatum: keep reading to explore the details for a deeper understanding or skip to the next chapter with at least these implications in mind. This “choose your own adventure” organization gives the book a refreshing flexibility that is too often absent from pop-physics novels.Writing style also plays a large role in this work’s success. Richard Feynman, one of the more beloved albeit quirky physicists of the 20th century, was famous for his conversational style physics lessons. Though this made Feynman an incredibly effective educator, he was never able to write a book for want of literary chops. Fabric is such a good read because Greene buttresses the same savvy teaching techniques with an eloquent style of storytelling. Some parts are downright poetic and they uncover the easily missed romance and excitement of scientific discovery. He writes, “By deepening our understanding of the true nature of physical reality, we profoundly reconfigure our sense of ourselves and our experience of the universe.” And other parts are surprisingly suspenseful, especially for a narrative with such well-publicized plot twists. Even though most people know that Albert Einstein would propose his groundbreaking theories of relativity in the early 1900s, until Greene gets to that part of the story, this reader was genuinely concerned about the troublesome relationship between absolute space and time. (Spoiler: It all works out beautifully!)One of the more striking features of The Fabric of the Cosmos is how Greene’s enthusiasm for modern physics almost leaps off the page, making the reader wonder, if only for a second, whether or not the Large Hadron Collider will actually produce spontaneous symmetry breaking of massive scalar bosons. But that’s beside the point. To wonder about the world around us is the first step on the path to scientific discovery and Greene’s work makes it so that anyone can find the way."

Get me into anything more than general commentary, discoveries, famous names and famous theories, and I'm completely at a loss. Green is a likable and passionate author, but for readers without a physics knowledge base, his little treatise is tough going, even with all the Simpsons references. I remember the most important concepts, but the intricacies didn't stick with me. This book is best read in segments, preferably when you're completely lucid and can take notes. "
38,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17463213-j-m-hushour,5,"Being utterly unscientific (I still believe toasters toast toast by invoking thrice the name of said bread and summoning forth a kind of crisping deity), I pounce on shit for the lay reader. Sacks, Sagan, Ramachandran, Richard Simmons, etc. I had never heard of Brian Greene and have typically held physics and such things at arm's length, with my other hand pinching my nose shut as if holding the world's most curious diaper: there is probably much of interest within to parse out, but noxious enough to keep me anyway. This book was recommended to me (okay, it was a present) by a friend who seems to be aware of my constant questioning of the nature of the very fabric of reality itself. Luckily, this book squares a lot of things and sets them to rights for me.Greene is an awesome writer. He's funny and he describes this complicated shizz really well (he likes to make Simpsons analogies). There are few parts that are mind-bending to the point where I got a headache. Greene will outright warn you to skip ahead if its getting too dense, which is nice.As to the actual content? Fuck, it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I'll just say, I came out of the book feeling and sounding smarter. I can rap about three-branes, the Many Worlds hypothesis and impress my friends with my knowledge of the eleven spacetime dimensions.All-in-all, satisfying, funny, and informative."

This book was not the answer to my acquisition of knowledge. In fact, I learned almost nothing from this book. The writing is awful. It seeks to explain through dense prose, repetitive text, asinine pop references and endless in text questions. It really just shows why science writers should write books for the general public, not most scientists. Further, the author is in love with his superstring research and theory, but never convinced me it actually exists. All in all, it’s hard for me to express my disgust with this book. At least my nightmare and dread of reading on with this book have come to an end. I will never read this author again and may just avoid cosmos and superstring science if there’s no better work out there. "
40,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Glancing at the reviews for Brian Greene's overview of how we view the stuff of which our universe is made, it seems that some people base their rating and opinion on how much they agree with the science, or how credible they find it. While I have read a fair few popular science books – especially in the areas of physics and cosmology, areas I find utterly fascinating and about which I am perplexed that anyone can not be astounded and beguiled – I have to assume that I am reading a fair explanation of facts and theories. That is not to say that I assume the author is more knowledgeable than me simply because he has more letters after his name, but because he grounds his claims with background and the weight of evidence that is needed for a scientific hypothesis to become a generally accepted theory. Also, I have taken the effort to educate myself in these areas so have enough grounding myself to be able to appreciate the arguments.That said, for much of this book I'm unsure how much background would be needed to understand the explanations. Greene writes with a clarity and readability which is all too rare in any field, and is particularly welcome in discussing such big ideas. As in Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, Greene completely dispenses with calculations but, unlike Hawking, he also tries to keep the use of metaphor to a minimum. It cannot, of course, be dispensed with completely – metaphors are an extraordinarily powerful descriptive tool, especially in a field that can only properly be explained and understood using specialist mathematics – but for the most part Greene simply gives an overview of each field in historical context, and explains WHY it is important, what it explains and why it works.He starts – as modern physics in so many fields must – with Isaac Newton, and particularly Newton's Bucket. If you hang a bucket of water on a rope and twist the rope, as the rope unwinds, spinning the bucket, at first the water remains stationary until the friction of the bucket's movement makes the water begin to spin. When it does, the surface becomes increasingly concave, moved outward by what why now call centripetal (or centrifugal) force. But what, asked Newton, is the water moving away from, or toward? What is it moving in relation to? He decided that it moved in relation to the fixed fabric of the cosmos, the stuff in which the matter (that he recognised as being the thing on which gravity works) sits. Recognising that he had no way of testing this medium by experiment, Newton took this is an immutable absolute and left it at that. Greene keeps returning to the bucket and its implications throughout the book, to superb explanatory effect.I won't go further into the details (read the book!), but simply say that thanks to Professor Greene I now understand areas of cosmology and physics where I had previously had to simply give in to brain cramp and accept as being true. I understand why the speed of light (actually, the speed of any electromagnetic radiation) is approx 300, 000 km/sec faster than you, no matter how fast you are travelling. I understand a whole lot more about General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and why they make sense and are such powerful tools in describing our universe. I understand that Inflationary Theory is not merely a tweak of Big Bang theory to enable it to fit observed facts, but a whole new way of looking at the growth of the universe that actually explains much more about the fundamental physics.I'm not claiming a thorough understanding of these subjects (and in some, like Brane Theory, I still found myself rather lost; a re-read may be in order), but I feel that The Fabric of the Cosmos has deepened my comprehension of and appreciation for the wonders of our universe. And for the wonders of the human mind to work out these things. In around three hundred years we have developed this system, science, as a means of examining the world around us in a way which is comprehensible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. All books on science now seem to feel the need to restate this about science; it is NOT knowledge passed down from on high by men in white coats using deliberately obfuscatory language for reasons of either professional pride or conspiracy. Science is a method that enables us to understand more and more about the world, to revel in the joy of knowing how the rainbow is formed as well as in its simple beauty. No idea in science is sacrosanct, no theory is holy. To achieve the status of acceptance of say, General Relativity or Evolution by Natural Selection, a theory has to be tested – that is, it has to survive again and again and again the onslaught of people systematically trying to prove it wrong. When a weakness is found the theory must be re-examined. Sometimes the fault will cause the foundations of the theory to crumble, and it will be discarded; it has still served a purpose, to show how promising such an approach is. Sometimes finding the errors will strengthen a theory and teach us more – Edwin Hubble's original calculations of distant galaxies seemed to show the universe to be about 1.5 billion years old, despite lots of other evidence at the time insisting it was at least 3 billion years old (as we now know, this was still almost five times too conservative). Everything else about Hubble's observation and theory made sense, there was simply an error in calculating the distance of the super novae he was using to get the figures, a correction which itself taught us much about the universe.And this is incredibly important to realise because, while many theories, however much work they take, partly make sense on an intuitive level you get to Quantum and Brane theory and they simply cannot – in fact they seem, by intuition and everyday experience, utterly ridiculous (the great physicist Nils Bor said something along the lines of “if you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory”) but they are undoubtedly right. One important way a theory is tested is to use it to make predictions in the physical world and Quantum Theory has been called far and away the most successful predictive theory in science. It is, like every successful theory, one that accurately describes the way our universe works, with the limits of perception and understanding we have, which is why theories are modified or discarded when new information comes along. Which is why General Relativity replaced Newton's Laws of Gravitation as the best description we have for how gravity works – although NASA still use Newton's calculations most of the time, for the same reason you don't need to understand Gaussian Quadratic Maths to balance your chequebook.Greene's book, the first I've read by him, shows why it is worth reading a range of books on the same (or closely connected) areas of science. While in The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinov managed to convey a sense of wonder and discovery on a par with Carl Sagan's writings (a plaudit I don't throw around lightly!), Greene has given us a book that manages a clarity and depth of explanation while being a thoroughly entertaining read. At schools, perhaps instead of training our children into narrowly defined roles, science classes should just be introducing them to the works of Greene and Hawking, Sagan and Tyson (Neil deGrasse, not Mike) and Krauss to show them how huge and wonderful and beautiful the universe is, and how much joy and fulfilment can be achieved through our efforts to understand it."
41,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,5,"What an incredible journey this was. I think Brian is fantastically gifted to explain esoteric and cutting-edge cosmological concepts without the use of formulae and maths. He says himself that he will only use metaphors to explain the ideas, but even so he remains respectful of his subject, he does not dumb things down, and I found the metaphors for the most part evocative and helpful. Towards the end of the book, however, the ideas get so far removed from human intuition that I would have wanted a little more formalism, perhaps. But - this was on offer as well! Brian adds a copious body of footnotes and in this way relegates a more rigorous discussion to the back of the book. This discussion will of course still not satisfy those who have an in-depth understanding of the science involved, but I don't think they are the target group of this book in the first place. To me, this was the best account of the current state (well, it's ten years old, but close enough) of cosmology I have read. The field appears to be so fast-moving that some of his statements in the later chapters have already been overtaken by reality, but there is a special charm in hearing Brian suggest that the LIGO experiment may demonstrate the existence of gravitational waves in decades to come when you know that this has already happened, much sooner than he thought. Equally, I felt a pang of regret when he expresses optimism that the LHC runs may find evidence of extra spatial dimensions soon after the upgrade to higher energies, knowing this has not happened yet, and scepticism is mounting that it ever will.Transcending what Brian was actually teaching me about the science, I also had an epiphany when I was reading the book. Brian talks at length about the shortcomings of the Big Bang theory, and explains how the theory of inflation may answer some of its more frustrating issues, such as the flatness problem. The flatness problem highlights the issue that a tiny difference in origin conditions would have generated a universe entirely different from the one we observe today. Now, I have always thought that this is no mystery, the fact that we are here to observe this universe is the reason we may puzzle about these finetuned conditions, but they are just one in many, equally possible, universes, and our surprise is therefore of our own making. I even thought this position was enlightened, and quite clever. But Brian explained that physicists abhor theories that rely on unknown qualities, on axiomatic pronouncements that accept something as a given. I understood that only by asking ""why"" were physicists able to develop a theory that explains the finetuning, and go beyond the Big Bang as the creation theory of the universe. And this was an excellent lesson to me. I think I knew this once, but I had forgotten about it. In my case, my anthropic stance was actually an attempt on my part to avoid a deeper question, an attempt to posit an answer where there wasn't one yet. Brian reminded me that we must never stop asking ""why"", that asking ""why"" is what makes us human. I loved this book. I can only recommend it to anybody who does not have a formal degree in science and wants to learn more about cosmology but is a bit frustrated about the lack of depth popular accounts of this topic typically provide."

Greene avoids both. This is hands down the best popular intro to modern physics I've found. Even with half a B.S. in physics and formal courses on many of the topics covered, this book consistently kept my interest and taught me new things.Two unique aspects of this book I haven't found elsewhere are (1) its focus on space and time and (2) its enthusiasm. As for (1), most pop sci books on physics focus on trying to convey one or more specific theories (quantum theory, special relativity, string theory, etc) and may discuss space or time in the context of one of these theories but don't make connections between them. Greene actually makes space and time the main character of this story and follows them throughout history and across theories. As for (2), not since Richard Feynman have I found a physicist whose writing makes me shiver with childish delight at the wonders of the universe. Some might find his poetic geeky gushes cheesy, but others (like myself) will spend the next several evenings lying outside on their lawns, staring at the stars, and just basking in the awesomeness of it all.That said, don't expect a book without mathematics to convey a full picture of our current understanding of physics. Nature seems to be written most naturally in the language of mathematics and that is the language in which she must be read. Hopefully though, if you haven't gotten over a particularly frightening encounter with mathematics as a young impressionable child, this book will convince you that it's worth doing.If you:

   are interested in modern physics but don't know where to start 
   have read a few pop sci books or many pop sci articles but want to see how many of the ideas fit together 
   or curious about our past and current understanding of space and time
...then I highly recommend this book, regardless of your background."
44,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This was as very confounding book to me - not confusing but confounding. It has some amazing observations and conundrums to ponder over and I suspect I did not appreciate (or even understand all that it had to tell me).Let me explain - some of the chapters used examples - some of which I have actually studied in my years in education. For example the example where electrons can be treated as particles while at the same time be treated as waves. Now I remember the experiments and I remember the theory that went with them. But I did not associated them with the bigger picture being presented in the chapter. And so the reason why I am confounded- this book challenges many of the scientific notions, a few it takes and builds upon them often reinforcing the notions it is trying to convey. And yet reading this book I feel there is so much more to learn and understand (including some of the sections in the book itself). Ironically looking back at my education I realise that rather than trying to build a foundation for me to build upon I feel like it have been shown how little I know and how so much there is still to explore and learn.Books like this have a variety of effects on me - but this is the first to make me feel so small in the scheme of things. But rather than making it feel a negative experience its almost like a reassurance that you are part of everything and in the right place. As I have said earlier there is more to be learnt from this book - but for now I need let my mind rest as its had a bit of a work out reading these pages. "

This is not a book I would recommend if you are only wanting to be entertained, but I will say this; several times during this read I snapped out a stupor and realized I had been staring off into space, lost in those thoughts of time, space, and reality.

My only criticism is that Greene can't figure out who his audience is: there's an odd mix of esoterica and the mundane. Most of the esoteric stuff is banished to the footnotes, which are well worth reading--and I suppose I should be happy that it's there at all, since most books on modern science are written with Hawking's Editor's Law in mind: with each equation, your audience shrinks by 90%.

I guess at least now I am familiar enough with the concepts which confuse me to be able to sound like I know something about general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory over beers with friends, and that's the important thing, right?Greene uses lots of pop cultural referenced examples to illustrate difficult mathematic/theoretical constructs, so familiarity with the Simpsons, X-Files, Star Trek and Star Wars may sometimes have you thinking ""hey, I know what he's talking about"" even when you have no clue. I think some of it actually did sink in, so I'm going to recommend this to anyone who desires a primer on the advances in physics & cosmology since e=mc2 but doesn't want to read a bunch of equations."

After reading this book, you'll always have unfinished business in discovering more and more about the universe. This book is a very good intro to physics and discovering about the universe."
51,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951046-john,4,"Lots of really interesting things in this book. I didn't realize physics had progressed so far in finding a unification theory.What I found most interesting would probably horrify the author because, while he didn't say so in so many words, he apparently really believes that physics is, or can be, the answer to everything. I, on the other hand, believe there is a God, the Christian God, who has a hand in our existence.I have always thought it curious that descriptions of God or angels appearing to people seem to be accompanied by bright light and that the supernatural being just appears out of nowhere. Upon reflection this seemed to me very much like them coming out of another dimension. So, what to my surprise, some of the current notions coming out of physics is that reality consists of more dimensions than we currently are able to experience. Score one for angels appearing out of nowhere because they can move from another dimension into our 3-dimensional existence.Then there's the issue of God being omniscient, i.e. knowing everything, past, present, and future. OK, He's God, so I suppose he can know all that, but it seems kind of difficult to figure how He can know the future when it hasn't happened yet. So, what to my surprise again, I learn that physics suggests that space and time are not independent but should be considered spacetime. And (from page 452) ""that moments--the events making up the spacetime loaf--just are. They are timeless. Each moment--each event or happening--exists, just as each point in space exists."" So it appears that someone, God, for instance, who has extent in another dimension outside our spacetime, could presumably see all of our spacetime, past, present, and future. Wow!Now what about free will or agency? Christians believe that people can choose to do good or do evil and are therefore responsible for the consequences. On the other hand (from page 455), ""The laws of classical physics are deterministic. ...if you were to know precisely how things are now (the position and velocity of every particle in the universe), the laws of classical physics would tell you exactly how things were are would be at any other moment you specified. The equations are indifferent to the supposed freedom of human will."" So, according to classical physics, there is no such thing as agency or free will. But then along comes quantum theory and one view is (from page 456), ""...if the passage from probabilities to definite outcomes requires something beyond the standard quantum framework--it's at least possible that free will might find a concrete realization within physical law. We might one day find, as some physicists has speculated, that the act of conscious observation is an integral element of quantum mechanics, being the catalyst that coaxes one outcome from the quantum haze to be realized."" Greene goes on to say, ""Personally, I find this extremely unlikely, but I know of no way to rule it out."" He doesn't like it, but he has the honesty to admit that it's a possibility.Those who have faith that God exists don't, or shouldn't, need science to back Him up. But I've got to admit that it is nice when it does. Of course, as Greene points out, much of what physics proposes is theory that has not been experimentally verified. Some of the above may be supplanted in the future by other theories, but for the time being it is interesting that science seems to verify some of the attributes of God as understood by Christians."
52,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Once again, as in ""The Elegant Universe,"" Greene has done an exemplary job of presenting a ""popular"" explication of deep science (particle physics and cosmology) that is neither condescending nor watered down. I've been amazed both times than anyone could pull this off, since it's been attempted so often but left the subjects either impenetrable or eviscerated.Greene's salient attribute is clarity: He can find and present the basic contours of just about any scientific discipline in clear, disciplined, open outline. He employs several simple, elementary approaches to make this happen.• short, direct, declarative sentences: Beautiful writing with little waste.• analogy: His use of analogy to elucidate arcane concepts is spot on even when (especially when) the comparison seems initially off the wall. I can't, in any way, overestimate the worth of this ability. (Bertrand Russell made a hash of explaining relativity with a raft of confounding, muddying analogies.)• repetition: Greene presents an idea and its details from several different but complementary directions that both reinforce the underlying principles and keep them continually in mind. And he doesn't assume that once he's outlined a concept, you will automatically recall its ramifications three days later. Instead, when he refers to it again, he summarizes it quickly, as if reminding a friend walking with him down a forest path. • basic fairness: Greene has his biases (mostly in favor of string theory and its near relatives), which he never denies. But he gives full credit to the other theorists down the block, admits the failings of the theories he loves and the positive side of the others.• combining inside-outside views: Any enterprise can create a corporate worldview where what you're doing assumes a centrality that the rest of humanity might consider either scary or amusing. Greene is an insider, to different degrees, in the enterprises of mathematics, physics and string theory. Yet he does a pretty complete job of balancing the committed insider against the (more) objective outsider. He speaks equally well for himself, for the wider theoretical community, and to you, looking through the window. Greene's writing and willingness to share himself have grown since ""The Elegant Universe."" It shows most in his humor. He kept it under tight rein in the first work, but here it wanders out to laugh in the sun. ""The Simpsons"" in all their glory rollick throughout the book without apology, and the analogies often have a giggle in them that in no way limits their affect.Some of the elements I'd regretted being missed from ""The Elegant Universe"" are here in detail, in part because of the intervening half decade between publication, but I think more because that's what he's chosen here to add on. You've got dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs field (prior to the way-too-recent discovery of the Higgs boson), inflationary cosmology.I'm looking forward to reading his still more recent work."
53,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"Did Greene plagiarise a section of his book? More on that later.Oh, god, I'm surprised I finished it. For the most part, I enjoy theoretical physics. I'm not sure if I believe everything that theoretical physics proposes (but then again, I'm not one for blindly allowing myself to be pulled along by an entity I can't see), but I enjoy it nonetheless. And I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. Greene offers some thought provoking ideas, and he even mentions at one point the author of one of my favourite theoretical physics books,Lisa Randall. Unfortunately, Greene is unable to translate all his ideas into legible text. I was able to understand some of what he was saying, but after a while, my eyes started to glaze over and I was left puzzling my own existence. Greene tends to throw ideas out there (such as cracked eggs becoming whole again, or ice forming in a glass of warm water and then melting once more) without giving a warning, that leaves the reader wondering if perhaps Greene has lost his marbles in the search for truth. Furthermore, and this may be more a publisher's error, but the book promised discussion on black holes and the like- my favourite of all astronomical topics. However, black holes are only mentioned in depth in the last twenty odd pages. However, there was a chapter on time travel, wormholes and alternate universes, but that was only a short chapter in of itself.There was one segment I did catch that made me sit up and laugh. I only would have caught it because I read Flash Forward by Richard J. Sawyer shortly before this book. Greene and Sawyer both use the same analogy of Gone With the Wind as a way of describing looking through time, in exactly the same manner. Seeing as Sawyer wrote his novel first (back in 1999) and The Fabric of the Cosmos was written in 2004, I can only suspect that Greene was, er, inspired if you will to use it. Still, I'm sure Sawyer would appreciate the credit."
54,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Periodically I get inspired to read big science books aimed at clarifying things to laypeople without any maths. Generally, each time I get slightly further than I did the previous time before eventually losing focus and coasting to the end. This was one of those times. Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.Anyway. Some notes I took:The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!Maxwell/EinsteinMaxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.Quantum MechanicsLight tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.Part 2 - TimeTalks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.Quantum Mechanics + time.If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.CosmologyHubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of Back to the Future.Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. "
55,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"I wish I could say 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' is an easy read which makes clear a subject that only geniuses understand normally about what classic physics and quantum mechanics have to do with understanding the mysteries of cosmology, particularly the theories regarding what the universe is, how it began, what made it function the way it does and why there seems to be an arrow of Time. I can't. Physics is too hard for me. However, Brian Greene is a brilliant man with a teacher's magic talent of sussing out how to simplify and explain difficult complexities of scientific thought. His book 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' did not lose me until the final six chapters! Gentle reader, I highly recommend this book.Physics is not only about observations and experiments, it is mostly about interpreting horribly complicated maths. Fortunately, Brian Greene leaves the math for the 'Notes' section in the back of this book while describing through analogies and simple-as-possible, and logical, well-written historical vignettes about the key physics discoveries by famous physicists which illuminate the nature of space and time. Each step of increasing scientific knowledge important to cosmology is described in a logical procession of conclusions, facts and theories, chapter by chapter. I finally understood many much briefer and out-of-context explanations in science articles which I have occasionally read. (However, I think I will not remember much of this enlightenment in a few weeks, alas.)The newest theories and guesses, described in chapters 12-16, about three-branes and brane splats, extra dimensions, string theory holograms, super-symmetry particle spinning, potential energy bowls, free will (yes, I said free will), five-string theories, two 'Big Bang' theories, and loop quantum gravity, by these genius scientists are the hardest of all to understand by this ordinary mortal, gentle reader, but perseverance with 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' DID make a small collapse of probabilities in the jittering mass of my excited brain particles so that this cat was radiant with more intelligence upon exiting the ebook. Unfortunately, though, I have a feeling this enlightenment is but a moon's dim reflective glow, gone as soon as the sun rises."
56,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is a nice overview of modern physics, including implications of relativity (specific and general), quantum mechanics and string theory, together with a discussion of the implications for cosmology. Some of the interesting items discussed here include the notion that during the ""Planck time"", ie, 10^(-34) sec or so after the Big Bang, space and time had no meaning, that our 3-D universe may be only an illusion of an underlying 11-dimensional universe, and reality may be coded in a cosmic ""hologram"", and that our universe may be only a minor dot in an incomparably vaster ""multiverse"".My own objection to this book is that most of this material has been written elsewhere -- for starters, Greene's earlier book ""The Elegant Universe"" was an excellent introduction to string theory and its implications. That's a problem with writing a great book -- it's hard to match the same level of excitement in the next book.The other criticism that one might raise is that string theory and the multiverse, in particular, remain highly controversial in the field. Indeed, some scientists (such as Lee Smolin) are saying out loud that string theory has been given too much rope for too long, and it is time to face the reality that it has not produced any crisp, testable hypotheses (nor is it likely to for a while). For the same reasons, many are opposed to the notion of the ""multiverse"", not just for technical reasons but also for philosophical reasons -- how can the hypothesis of an infinity of companion universes, whose existence can only be indirectly suggested, even in principle, qualify as empirical science?"
57,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel,5,"The book focused mainly on the concepts of space and time, and how they build the universe around us. Starting with the concept of space and how that's changed over the years, then time and how that's changed and now the concept of spacetime, and then the universe itself. A large part of the book was used trying to explain, ""time's arrow"" why things go forward but never backwards, why entropy is always greater in the future and never the past. It was all very interesting. At times I did get a bit lost, though not that often, but I feel now I have a much better understanding of a lot of modern physics concepts and ideas, for example I know understand Pbranes user name! I never really understood the big bang, that the universe was expanding, not that things were just getting flung further out into space. I think inflationary cosmology is neat. (even if it doesn't tie everything together). The chapter I enjoyed the most I think had to be looking at the teleportation and possibilities of time travel in the future. It was definitely more on the what if end of physics, but it was very interesting and I really enjoyed his explanations for why there would be no paradox. But it's definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in learning how the universe might work, and how in a lot of ways it does. It made a nice change for me to read a book about a subject I know so little about. While I cannot therefore give an expert opinion about it's accuracy, it was fascinating and I feel like I understand the world a lot more now."
58,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-ivan-vukovi,5,"This is as fine (or very near) as popular physics goes. Although the book is maybe a bit too simple at times, I really enjoyed how Greene is able to present some very difficult concepts by gradually building up ideas. Instead of jumping over here and over there, he leads the reader in a very precise (well, as precise as you can get without serious mathematics) and logical manner which seems to be satisfying both to the layman and to the expert. Excellent!"

60,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"I like to talk shit about science sometimes. Sometimes it's just to push people's buttons and other times it's because of the pop side of science is ridiculous (you know like the studies that get quoted on your web-browsers start-up page, which may even be contradicted a few days from now by some other article, or all those fucking pharmaceutical ad's on TV. Hey, thanks Pfizer for helping make me a drug addict!). I just made a slight at pop-science and that is hypocritical of me, it's really the only type of science I can understand and this book basically falls into that category, it's a watered down version of real science so humanities idiots like me can understand concepts that they would stare open mouthed at if they had to read the actual articles about. By the way, I loved this book! Starting with a seemingly simple problem (or I would think it's simple, but it took a few hundred years and Einstein to adequately understand it, apparently (not that I could figure it out) about why the water in a bucket pushes up against the side of the bucket when you spin the bucket around really fast, Brian Green creates a narrative (I'm using this in it's normal manner, not in the science as narrative way that I use it when I want to piss people off, this book is a history of science book in quite a few ways) that shows how this bucket filled with some water paved the way for Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Uncertainty, the Big Bang, String Theory, M-Theory, Branes and other concepts that helped move forward theoretical understandings of the whole universe. Oh, actually the underlying theme to the book is how do we understand the concepts of space and time, or spacetime, which is one of the problems of understanding why the water in the bucket does what it does when it is spun around. Oh, did I mention I loved this book? I feel awkward giving it five stars because I lack the critical acumen to know if Brian Green is really telling the whole story, or if there is a huge bias here because I'm an idiot when it comes to matters like this. I felt like he was being fair though but maybe I was just dazzled by any of the mathematics he would throw into footnotes that I wouldn't have the first idea on what to do with if someone handed me even the simplest one and asked me to solve it. About a hundred pages into the book I had the realization that I should have been more interested in math and science growing up. More exactly I had the realization that the way math and science were taught in the schools I attended did nothing to inspire me at all. I'm fairly certain that most people never use most of the information they learn in science classes. I've never had the need to know all the parts of a flower, but if I had been taught something about what went into discovering some of the biology of (x) or say about the real awesomeness of evolution I'd probably have perked up and gotten interested. Or maybe learned about the difficulties still facing scientists when dealing with the subatomic level, and the weirdness of quantum uncertainty and entanglement might have gotten me more interested and wanting to know more in a chemistry class than endlessly learning how to balance electrons between elements (or whatever that fruitless exercise was called). I know these details are really important to doing science, but without any reason to care about wanting to know about science this is all just monumental busy work. Shouldn't it be the job of schools to get kids to care and wanting to learn rather than forcing meaningless facts onto them? This rantish aside about the misguided importance (pedological approach?) of science education in American schools was just me being bitter. It's too late now, and I'm too dumb in too many areas of knowledge but I should have been a theoretical physicist. That is what I realized reading this book. I wish someone had told me about the weird shit these people try to figure out, explained who Parmenides was and the basic gist of his Poem was, and then told me I could work on these problems for the rest of my life if I started to pay attention in math class and gave a shit about my science classes, that there was cool stuff I'd get to later on. Parmenides is never mentioned in this book, but at almost every step through the book he kept popping into my mind. He's my reoccurring fascination. His idea of the everything just being One at first glance is so silly. I remember the first time reading Zeno's Paradoxes (he was Parmenides student) and thinking they were just silly games with words, obviously something moves faster than something else and can over come it. Obviously an arrow shot at a target eventually hits it. Duh! But sometime soon after my immediate annoyance at these kinds of meaningless games something clicked in me and I started to try to think through what Parmenides could mean by the whole universe being an unchanging, undivisible, timeless thing. A point, if you would. On one level Parmenides can be thought of as the logical foil to the pre-Socratic materialists, the voice that says your theory is nice but what about (x)? I don't buy into the idea that was Parmenides only goal though. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know exactly what Parmenides thought, because of thanks to those motherfucking Christians and Moslems (you know for their multiple burnings of the Library of Alexandria (and Christians for their wanton destruction of 'heretical' literature) we have only a scant few fragments left from Parmenides work, and most of it is second hand from the post-Socratic arch-materialist Aristotle (materialist meaning something sort of different in the Ancient Greek sense than one would think of a materialist today). Are you bored yet?Anyway, back to Parmenides, I don't buy the idea that his role was only as foil, or goad to the materialists to make their theories more logically consistent. Why? Because of Plato. Socrates is bested only twice in the dialogues. First as a young man by Parmenides of Elea (the guy I've been writing about) in Parmenides and second by the Eleatic Stranger in The Sophist and The Statesman (these two dialogues are like a part one and part two to each other). The appearance of the Eleatic Stranger is in the two dialogues that come at the end of Socrates life, before the series of dialogues that make up the trial and death of Socrates. In both instances Socrates is bested in his arguments by the philosophy coming from Elea. Why? Why is the only person who Plato allows to give Socrates a philosophical beat-down either Parmenides or a stand in for him? (Parmenides himself couldn't be in a chronologically later dialogue, since he was an old man when Socrates was a youth). Anyway, long story that doesn't mean too much to anyone probably, but to sum it up Parmenides has been an thought game for me for years now, and many of the ideas that I've had to reconcile what Parmenides means I find in this fucking book, there are people who are seriously considering some of the logical games I play in my head about cosmology, but they have math and ways of actually coming up with answers! I haven't done a good job at it, but to me this is so exciting. It's like all of the crazy shit that philosophers have thought up over the years can be actually studied and not just argued about using a mismash of concepts and logic, but possibly measured and articulated with math and shit! This book is like a validation to the stuff I think about when I'm not just wallowing in self-pity or being sad. Of course, I knew that a lot of this stuff existed before reading this book, but I had no idea what any of it really meant. I just took the words and applied common meanings to them. String Theory? Oh, everything is interconnected with vibrating strings. Actually, no. That's not what String Theory means. Multi-dimensions, you mean like people could be living in a dimension almost on top of me that I don't see because I don't have access to those dimensions, but one day maybe we could, right? No, actually even if the dimensions are big, the word big is being used on a microscopic scale, like the width of a piece of hair big, as opposed to small as in so small we have nothing that can see it. I realized that most of the ways books in the new age section use science terms to validate their ideas and how they claim to be drawing on cutting edge research is bullshit, that they are just picking terms out and using them in ways to sell books on hokum. I realized reading this book that I wish I wasn't so stupid and that I could at least understand this stuff at more than in a non-technical watered down way."
61,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"Did you know that Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect anagram of “A Second Herring Quits”? And is a near perfect anagram of “Surely someone’s taking the piss”? The second anagram relies, of course (and almost entirely), on a rather judicious application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – but I do think that one may be more illuminating of how I’m finding some of the quantum mechanical experiments described in this book. There is part of me that would like to believe that in the early part of the last century (I don’t remember the year, but surely on an April First) a group of European physicists got together and decided to come up with an idea so monumentally ridiculous that it would have them chuckling at the gullibility of we more mathematically challenged for years to come. Einstein was in on the joke at the start, but ended up thinking it had all gone on for far too long. Frynman introduced some slapstick into the equations (in a fine American tradition) – but, as always, it takes an Irishman (John Bell) to put the final touches on the comedy and to make it truly surreal. So, why isn’t anybody laughing?If you are not disturbed by the findings of Quantum Mechanics, well, you’re really not trying hard enough. This is quite some book so far.UpdateOkay, I’ve finished and I’ve had problems with this one. In fact, I have many problems with modern physics and believe that the only way I could really understand it more would be to go back and finish off a degree in this stuff. Since I’m unlikely to do that, I am going to have to accept that this stuff will have to remain a mystery to me. This guy really does try to make this stuff accessible, but I’ve a feeling that without the maths it just does not make any sense on any level.My problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that every time there is a problem in Physics we are having trouble solving we just make up something invisible to solve it. Universe not expanding fast enough? Stuff it full of dark matter. Expanding too fast? Bring back the Cosmological Constant. Can’t make gravity fit in with quantum theory? Postulate string theory. Having trouble with quantum theory? Why not create an infinite number of universes that can’t access each other. Having trouble explaining the vibrations of one dimensional strings? Vibrate them in 11 dimensional space.Bring back the Ether, I say. Physics never seems to do anything by half. Even cosmic inflation seems to have inflated the universe to a ridiculous extent in the first nanosecond of the universe.I don’t believe I can really say anything sensible about any of this stuff. It is so far divorced from my limited understanding that to express an opinion really just makes me feel incredibly ignorant. Like I said, I’m not prepared to learn the maths, so I should just shut up. It is a pity physics has become so esoteric – I would like to be one of its great defenders, to use it as a basis to understand the universe, but I come away from these books feeling someone is having me on.This is a good book, in part. Some of it is still remarkably hard going – even with the allusions to the Simpsons and X Files (I’ve never seen the X Files or some of the other bits of pop culture mentioned, so that made what I took to be some of the jokes quite inaccessible to me – but that will just be me). The stuff about Newton’s Bucket was utterly fascinating and well worth reading. The stuff of string theory was like most stuff on string theory – I’ve virtually no understanding of this stuff and can’t quite follow the controversy that surrounds it. Anyway, it sounds like no one will ever be able to test any of this stuff – if we can’t see an electron how the hell are we ever going to see a one dimensional string?My main problem with this book was his early explanation of entropy and how this did not provide an arrow of time. He says that if you watch a film of an egg falling and braking that you could reverse the film and there is nothing in the laws of physics to decide which direction the film travelled in that must be the right direction. He says that there would be a way to get all the bits of egg to fly back at the right speed and reconstitute. This, of course, is nonsense. It is not a matter of things coming back together at the right speed that is the issue. Have you ever broken a glass? You don’t get the pieces to go back together again by moving them together at the ‘right speed’. They never go back together again. This is a one way reaction. Why? Because once the glass is broken the bonds between the atoms in the glass are broken. Pushing the pieces together again is pushing negatively charged electrons against negatively charged electrons and they will repeal each other, not just nicely bond. There are laws of physics and laws of chemistry that do not allow this reversal. I figure that if I have spotted a flaw in this easy bit of his argument there are too many bits of this argument that I struggled to follow that may be just as equally flawed. (This stuff is from about page 145 – 169)I did learn some interesting stuff from this book – even about entropy. I had no idea that the arrow of entropy was double headed or that inflation was the main cause of order in the young universe. But large parts of this book deal with questions that are simply too esoteric. I ended up knowing that I would never know what was in a black hole or what caused the big bang and basically not really caring. I’m sure this wasn’t Greene’s intention, more is the pity."
62,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Wow, what a wonderful book. What a ride it was. Brian is definitely one of the best science popularisers about, hands down. It is amazing how he manages to convey potentially complex subjects, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, in a simple but at the same time rigorous manner. And he does that with a contagious enthusiasm which reminded to me why I love physics. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he never gets into the game (like so frequently happens in popular science books, unfortunately) of oversimplifying the subject. His book is very readable and he has a great gift of explaining complex subjects with an amazing clarity. While the book may be a bit too simple at times, more quantitative detail is available in the notes at the end of the book (which I strongly recommend you read, to get more detail), and bibliographic references are pretty good. It is a fantastic introductory book to the realm of contemporary physics - of course, if you are interested in more quantitative treatments of such subjects, then this is probably not the book for you - although I must say that everybody with an interest in science should really take the time to read this masterpiece. The author, being a foremost scientist directly involved in the most advanced research efforts in areas such as String Theory, does have his own preferences and biases (all honestly acknowledged by him, and also they do not impact the overall objectivity and impartiality of his book). Moreover, being particle physics an area of such intense and frantic development, there are a couple of area where the book looks a bit dated (for example, even if SUSY is not officially dead, the results coming out of the LHC are such that there is increasing doubt over the real prospects of SUSY and consequently of Super String Theories - although it is completely premature to claim that they are dead).Overall, it is an amazing introductory book, informative, entertaining, lucid, and a complete pleasure to read.

This feeling, this sensation that time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments—previous frames—to be ""sequentially illuminated.""﻿In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian GreeneI agree that this is at least as much philosophy as science, though mathematically based philosophy. But what irks me is that for all the pages of science books devoted to this subject, no one has pointed out that for us to experience moments sequentially (assuming those moments don't themselves move) our mind has to move through those moments. And movement entails time. So while time may be a spatial dimension, if Greene (and Godel, etc.) are right, then there must be at least one other dimension of time that allows our minds to move through the different moments that all exist and experience them sequentially.﻿"
64,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Let's start with the positives: Greene does an excellent job of explaining very hard-to-understand concepts in non-mathematical ways. That said, I think it was unecessary to use popular culture the way he did. It feels silly, reading about Einstein and general relativity and getting an example which uses the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart, and Lisa and so forth. But okay, I admit that this is a fairly small detail that shouldn't take too much away from the overall experience. The important thing is that the concepts are explained in a manner which is understandable. Does Greene do that? He does, for the most part.Furthermore, Greene is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and that is something that is contagious. Reading about the bucket argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_a...) and the various attempts at answering it; the exciting exploration of time, the arrow of time, and its mysteries; the exhilarating explanation of entropy; the outline of general relativity, quantum mechanics and a whole host of other physical theories, and on the whole Greene's passionate way of writing makes this an extremely engaging read. And the subject matter is interesting. I mean, the bending of space and time, particles being ""entangled"" (""spooky action at a distance"") through space, possible hidden dimensions, elusive particles, multiverses.. Paul Erdos said that ""if numbers aren't beautiful, I don't know what is."" Well, if this stuff isn't interesting, I don't know what is! Thus, overall, the book is extremely engaging and exciting, and it's one of those books that are very much, in many ways, unputdownable. Now, the negatives.First of all, the illustrations are almost no help, because they are of awful quality. I read the hardcover version, and even here they are small, with no colour and in fairly awful quality. Another problem with the book has been pointed out in this review as well, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... You get the impression that without the math, a lot of this just isn't really possible to convey properly. You are left with only a part of the picture. I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's words: ""To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."" Sometimes Greene is pretty frank about this. He'll essentially write, ""okay, I know this is far-fetched, but trust me on this one: the math is right, guys."" To Greene's credit, there are a lot of pages in the back of the book devoted to the more mathematically inclined reader, so that those who do get it can check it out for themselves. Now, the last negative aspect of the book is the fact that there's not a whole lot of new things here. If you've read The Elegant Universe, you don't really get a whole lot of new knowledge, except that this book is less about string theory and more about cosmology. I think it's enough to read one of them, which kind of renders this book somewhat unecessary. With all those negatives aside, the book is enjoyable and engaging. If you want some stretching exercises for your imagination, it's not a mistake to pick it up."

And as your eyes scanned ahead for those dreaded half-English, half-Greek words followed by an equal sign, the probability of you reading on fast approached zero.But there’s hope! Whether you realize it or not, you just visualized some of the more important natural phenomena that govern the world around us.

And your waning interest was a metaphor for quantum non-locality. What do these words mean? It doesn’t really matter. Even complicated physical processes were surmountable — even understandable — when they were put into the context of something familiar, say, traumatic experiences of young adulthood.Without analogy and metaphor, a reader can quickly suffocate in the rarified air of the hard sciences. The task then for any science writer is to couch these concepts in colloquial terms and familiar experiences, and no one does it better than Brian Greene. His second of two books, The Fabric of the Cosmos, is a potent distillation of 200 years of discovery and an invaluable roadmap of reality that is almost impossible to get lost with, regardless of your level of scientific knowledge. It is a compelling narrative of the search for understanding that probes the boundaries of human experience. Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, is not the first to attempt such a crash course in physics history and experiment for the non-science minded, and he won’t be the last. In fact, the popularity of this breed of book has even necessitated its own genre, which has come to be known as pop-physics. Make no mistake; it is truly a difficult task to make the revolutionary ideas of hundreds of brilliant people not only digestible, but palatable in fewer than 500 pages. Since you can’t change the elements of the story — an exhaustive historical record of dozens of collaborating countries — good science writing then becomes an exercise in conversational skills, patient instruction and plenty of examples.Greene is adept at all three but his skillful employment of examples is one of the book’s greatest strengths. Throughout the text, he uses objects we experience and protagonists we can visualize to illustrate his points. The Simpsons characters, Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, and former President Bill Clinton all appear on multiple occasions and eggs, snowflakes and bowling balls all serve as props. As juvenile as this might seem, you would be surprised at how effective Greene’s methods are. At one point in the book, he tries to explain how something called the Higgs ocean — typically the focus of a Ph.D. thesis — may give particles like protons and electrons their mass. But he uses a very familiar and somewhat playful example to illustrate the point. “If [a particle] has greater difficulty accelerating through the Higgs ocean, it has a greater mass. If we liken a particle’s mass to a person’s fame, then the Higgs ocean is like the paparazzi: those who are unknown pass through the swarming photographers with ease, but famous politicians and movie stars have to push much harder to reach their destination.”While this technique of using vivid examples seems straight forward, it is actually very easy to mess up and there are a few cardinal sins that many physics authors commit. A common transgression is to sacrifice accuracy for sensationalism under the misconception that science fiction is the only way to engage the average reader. The very talented Michio Kaku of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (the same place Einstein spent the last few decades of his life) is a repeat offender. His most recent work of pop-physics, called Hyperspace, contains examples that are shamelessly unscientific at times and really underestimate the reader’s intelligence.But by no means does Greene dumb down the information in Fabric and yet, none of the underlying ideas are lost. Further, he doesn’t resort to sensationalized hypothetical situations but instead finds a creative way to make the reader appreciate real scientific results. In doing so, he makes it more than understandable. He makes the reader appreciate and even enjoy the excitement of discovery.And if Greene’s delivery of concepts is superb, his thoughtful selection of content only reinforces the readability of the text. The fundamental — and most impressive — difference between Greene and most other science writers is the breadth of the issues he addresses. Another cardinal sin for a science writer is to allow a topic’s complexity to dictate its relevance, which is just a cop out and a disservice to the reader. Gary Zukov, the author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, basically left out entire chapters of vital experimental findings because they were too tough to couch in human experience. But Greene doesn’t succumb to such temptations of writing around difficult material. He acknowledges the complexity of problematic topics and painstakingly walks the reader through the material every time.Unfortunately, some concepts will be beyond analogy and word craft and require at least a cursory digression of technicalities. As Greene puts it: “Human language is far better at capturing human experience than at expressing deep physical laws.” But what is unique about Fabric is that Greene gives the reader the option to get more technical without a loss of continuity. Throughout the text, he would broach a huge topic by putting it into historical context and discussing its relevance in the big physics picture. Often, the section would end with an ultimatum: keep reading to explore the details for a deeper understanding or skip to the next chapter with at least these implications in mind. This “choose your own adventure” organization gives the book a refreshing flexibility that is too often absent from pop-physics novels.Writing style also plays a large role in this work’s success. Richard Feynman, one of the more beloved albeit quirky physicists of the 20th century, was famous for his conversational style physics lessons. Though this made Feynman an incredibly effective educator, he was never able to write a book for want of literary chops. Fabric is such a good read because Greene buttresses the same savvy teaching techniques with an eloquent style of storytelling. Some parts are downright poetic and they uncover the easily missed romance and excitement of scientific discovery. He writes, “By deepening our understanding of the true nature of physical reality, we profoundly reconfigure our sense of ourselves and our experience of the universe.” And other parts are surprisingly suspenseful, especially for a narrative with such well-publicized plot twists. Even though most people know that Albert Einstein would propose his groundbreaking theories of relativity in the early 1900s, until Greene gets to that part of the story, this reader was genuinely concerned about the troublesome relationship between absolute space and time. (Spoiler: It all works out beautifully!)One of the more striking features of The Fabric of the Cosmos is how Greene’s enthusiasm for modern physics almost leaps off the page, making the reader wonder, if only for a second, whether or not the Large Hadron Collider will actually produce spontaneous symmetry breaking of massive scalar bosons. But that’s beside the point. To wonder about the world around us is the first step on the path to scientific discovery and Greene’s work makes it so that anyone can find the way."

Get me into anything more than general commentary, discoveries, famous names and famous theories, and I'm completely at a loss. Green is a likable and passionate author, but for readers without a physics knowledge base, his little treatise is tough going, even with all the Simpsons references. I remember the most important concepts, but the intricacies didn't stick with me. This book is best read in segments, preferably when you're completely lucid and can take notes. "

Sacks, Sagan, Ramachandran, Richard Simmons, etc. I had never heard of Brian Greene and have typically held physics and such things at arm's length, with my other hand pinching my nose shut as if holding the world's most curious diaper: there is probably much of interest within to parse out, but noxious enough to keep me anyway. This book was recommended to me (okay, it was a present) by a friend who seems to be aware of my constant questioning of the nature of the very fabric of reality itself. Luckily, this book squares a lot of things and sets them to rights for me.Greene is an awesome writer. He's funny and he describes this complicated shizz really well (he likes to make Simpsons analogies). There are few parts that are mind-bending to the point where I got a headache. Greene will outright warn you to skip ahead if its getting too dense, which is nice.As to the actual content? Fuck, it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I'll just say, I came out of the book feeling and sounding smarter. I can rap about three-branes, the Many Worlds hypothesis and impress my friends with my knowledge of the eleven spacetime dimensions.All-in-all, satisfying, funny, and informative."

This book was not the answer to my acquisition of knowledge. In fact, I learned almost nothing from this book. The writing is awful. It seeks to explain through dense prose, repetitive text, asinine pop references and endless in text questions. It really just shows why science writers should write books for the general public, not most scientists. Further, the author is in love with his superstring research and theory, but never convinced me it actually exists. All in all, it’s hard for me to express my disgust with this book. At least my nightmare and dread of reading on with this book have come to an end. I will never read this author again and may just avoid cosmos and superstring science if there’s no better work out there. "
70,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Glancing at the reviews for Brian Greene's overview of how we view the stuff of which our universe is made, it seems that some people base their rating and opinion on how much they agree with the science, or how credible they find it. While I have read a fair few popular science books – especially in the areas of physics and cosmology, areas I find utterly fascinating and about which I am perplexed that anyone can not be astounded and beguiled – I have to assume that I am reading a fair explanation of facts and theories. That is not to say that I assume the author is more knowledgeable than me simply because he has more letters after his name, but because he grounds his claims with background and the weight of evidence that is needed for a scientific hypothesis to become a generally accepted theory. Also, I have taken the effort to educate myself in these areas so have enough grounding myself to be able to appreciate the arguments.That said, for much of this book I'm unsure how much background would be needed to understand the explanations. Greene writes with a clarity and readability which is all too rare in any field, and is particularly welcome in discussing such big ideas. As in Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, Greene completely dispenses with calculations but, unlike Hawking, he also tries to keep the use of metaphor to a minimum. It cannot, of course, be dispensed with completely – metaphors are an extraordinarily powerful descriptive tool, especially in a field that can only properly be explained and understood using specialist mathematics – but for the most part Greene simply gives an overview of each field in historical context, and explains WHY it is important, what it explains and why it works.He starts – as modern physics in so many fields must – with Isaac Newton, and particularly Newton's Bucket. If you hang a bucket of water on a rope and twist the rope, as the rope unwinds, spinning the bucket, at first the water remains stationary until the friction of the bucket's movement makes the water begin to spin. When it does, the surface becomes increasingly concave, moved outward by what why now call centripetal (or centrifugal) force. But what, asked Newton, is the water moving away from, or toward? What is it moving in relation to? He decided that it moved in relation to the fixed fabric of the cosmos, the stuff in which the matter (that he recognised as being the thing on which gravity works) sits. Recognising that he had no way of testing this medium by experiment, Newton took this is an immutable absolute and left it at that. Greene keeps returning to the bucket and its implications throughout the book, to superb explanatory effect.I won't go further into the details (read the book!), but simply say that thanks to Professor Greene I now understand areas of cosmology and physics where I had previously had to simply give in to brain cramp and accept as being true. I understand why the speed of light (actually, the speed of any electromagnetic radiation) is approx 300, 000 km/sec faster than you, no matter how fast you are travelling. I understand a whole lot more about General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and why they make sense and are such powerful tools in describing our universe. I understand that Inflationary Theory is not merely a tweak of Big Bang theory to enable it to fit observed facts, but a whole new way of looking at the growth of the universe that actually explains much more about the fundamental physics.I'm not claiming a thorough understanding of these subjects (and in some, like Brane Theory, I still found myself rather lost; a re-read may be in order), but I feel that The Fabric of the Cosmos has deepened my comprehension of and appreciation for the wonders of our universe. And for the wonders of the human mind to work out these things. In around three hundred years we have developed this system, science, as a means of examining the world around us in a way which is comprehensible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. All books on science now seem to feel the need to restate this about science; it is NOT knowledge passed down from on high by men in white coats using deliberately obfuscatory language for reasons of either professional pride or conspiracy. Science is a method that enables us to understand more and more about the world, to revel in the joy of knowing how the rainbow is formed as well as in its simple beauty. No idea in science is sacrosanct, no theory is holy. To achieve the status of acceptance of say, General Relativity or Evolution by Natural Selection, a theory has to be tested – that is, it has to survive again and again and again the onslaught of people systematically trying to prove it wrong. When a weakness is found the theory must be re-examined. Sometimes the fault will cause the foundations of the theory to crumble, and it will be discarded; it has still served a purpose, to show how promising such an approach is. Sometimes finding the errors will strengthen a theory and teach us more – Edwin Hubble's original calculations of distant galaxies seemed to show the universe to be about 1.5 billion years old, despite lots of other evidence at the time insisting it was at least 3 billion years old (as we now know, this was still almost five times too conservative). Everything else about Hubble's observation and theory made sense, there was simply an error in calculating the distance of the super novae he was using to get the figures, a correction which itself taught us much about the universe.And this is incredibly important to realise because, while many theories, however much work they take, partly make sense on an intuitive level you get to Quantum and Brane theory and they simply cannot – in fact they seem, by intuition and everyday experience, utterly ridiculous (the great physicist Nils Bor said something along the lines of “if you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory”) but they are undoubtedly right. One important way a theory is tested is to use it to make predictions in the physical world and Quantum Theory has been called far and away the most successful predictive theory in science. It is, like every successful theory, one that accurately describes the way our universe works, with the limits of perception and understanding we have, which is why theories are modified or discarded when new information comes along. Which is why General Relativity replaced Newton's Laws of Gravitation as the best description we have for how gravity works – although NASA still use Newton's calculations most of the time, for the same reason you don't need to understand Gaussian Quadratic Maths to balance your chequebook.Greene's book, the first I've read by him, shows why it is worth reading a range of books on the same (or closely connected) areas of science. While in The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinov managed to convey a sense of wonder and discovery on a par with Carl Sagan's writings (a plaudit I don't throw around lightly!), Greene has given us a book that manages a clarity and depth of explanation while being a thoroughly entertaining read. At schools, perhaps instead of training our children into narrowly defined roles, science classes should just be introducing them to the works of Greene and Hawking, Sagan and Tyson (Neil deGrasse, not Mike) and Krauss to show them how huge and wonderful and beautiful the universe is, and how much joy and fulfilment can be achieved through our efforts to understand it."
71,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,5,"What an incredible journey this was. I think Brian is fantastically gifted to explain esoteric and cutting-edge cosmological concepts without the use of formulae and maths. He says himself that he will only use metaphors to explain the ideas, but even so he remains respectful of his subject, he does not dumb things down, and I found the metaphors for the most part evocative and helpful. Towards the end of the book, however, the ideas get so far removed from human intuition that I would have wanted a little more formalism, perhaps. But - this was on offer as well! Brian adds a copious body of footnotes and in this way relegates a more rigorous discussion to the back of the book. This discussion will of course still not satisfy those who have an in-depth understanding of the science involved, but I don't think they are the target group of this book in the first place. To me, this was the best account of the current state (well, it's ten years old, but close enough) of cosmology I have read. The field appears to be so fast-moving that some of his statements in the later chapters have already been overtaken by reality, but there is a special charm in hearing Brian suggest that the LIGO experiment may demonstrate the existence of gravitational waves in decades to come when you know that this has already happened, much sooner than he thought. Equally, I felt a pang of regret when he expresses optimism that the LHC runs may find evidence of extra spatial dimensions soon after the upgrade to higher energies, knowing this has not happened yet, and scepticism is mounting that it ever will.Transcending what Brian was actually teaching me about the science, I also had an epiphany when I was reading the book. Brian talks at length about the shortcomings of the Big Bang theory, and explains how the theory of inflation may answer some of its more frustrating issues, such as the flatness problem. The flatness problem highlights the issue that a tiny difference in origin conditions would have generated a universe entirely different from the one we observe today. Now, I have always thought that this is no mystery, the fact that we are here to observe this universe is the reason we may puzzle about these finetuned conditions, but they are just one in many, equally possible, universes, and our surprise is therefore of our own making. I even thought this position was enlightened, and quite clever. But Brian explained that physicists abhor theories that rely on unknown qualities, on axiomatic pronouncements that accept something as a given. I understood that only by asking ""why"" were physicists able to develop a theory that explains the finetuning, and go beyond the Big Bang as the creation theory of the universe. And this was an excellent lesson to me. I think I knew this once, but I had forgotten about it. In my case, my anthropic stance was actually an attempt on my part to avoid a deeper question, an attempt to posit an answer where there wasn't one yet. Brian reminded me that we must never stop asking ""why"", that asking ""why"" is what makes us human. I loved this book. I can only recommend it to anybody who does not have a formal degree in science and wants to learn more about cosmology but is a bit frustrated about the lack of depth popular accounts of this topic typically provide."

Greene avoids both. This is hands down the best popular intro to modern physics I've found. Even with half a B.S. in physics and formal courses on many of the topics covered, this book consistently kept my interest and taught me new things.Two unique aspects of this book I haven't found elsewhere are (1) its focus on space and time and (2) its enthusiasm. As for (1), most pop sci books on physics focus on trying to convey one or more specific theories (quantum theory, special relativity, string theory, etc) and may discuss space or time in the context of one of these theories but don't make connections between them. Greene actually makes space and time the main character of this story and follows them throughout history and across theories. As for (2), not since Richard Feynman have I found a physicist whose writing makes me shiver with childish delight at the wonders of the universe. Some might find his poetic geeky gushes cheesy, but others (like myself) will spend the next several evenings lying outside on their lawns, staring at the stars, and just basking in the awesomeness of it all.That said, don't expect a book without mathematics to convey a full picture of our current understanding of physics. Nature seems to be written most naturally in the language of mathematics and that is the language in which she must be read. Hopefully though, if you haven't gotten over a particularly frightening encounter with mathematics as a young impressionable child, this book will convince you that it's worth doing.If you:

   are interested in modern physics but don't know where to start 
   have read a few pop sci books or many pop sci articles but want to see how many of the ideas fit together 
   or curious about our past and current understanding of space and time

74,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This was as very confounding book to me - not confusing but confounding. It has some amazing observations and conundrums to ponder over and I suspect I did not appreciate (or even understand all that it had to tell me).Let me explain - some of the chapters used examples - some of which I have actually studied in my years in education. For example the example where electrons can be treated as particles while at the same time be treated as waves. Now I remember the experiments and I remember the theory that went with them. But I did not associated them with the bigger picture being presented in the chapter. And so the reason why I am confounded- this book challenges many of the scientific notions, a few it takes and builds upon them often reinforcing the notions it is trying to convey. And yet reading this book I feel there is so much more to learn and understand (including some of the sections in the book itself). Ironically looking back at my education I realise that rather than trying to build a foundation for me to build upon I feel like it have been shown how little I know and how so much there is still to explore and learn.Books like this have a variety of effects on me - but this is the first to make me feel so small in the scheme of things. But rather than making it feel a negative experience its almost like a reassurance that you are part of everything and in the right place. As I have said earlier there is more to be learnt from this book - but for now I need let my mind rest as its had a bit of a work out reading these pages. "

Most of the esoteric stuff is banished to the footnotes, which are well worth reading--and I suppose I should be happy that it's there at all, since most books on modern science are written with Hawking's Editor's Law in mind: with each equation, your audience shrinks by 90%.

I think some of it actually did sink in, so I'm going to recommend this to anyone who desires a primer on the advances in physics & cosmology since e=mc2 but doesn't want to read a bunch of equations."

81,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951046-john,4,"Lots of really interesting things in this book. I didn't realize physics had progressed so far in finding a unification theory.What I found most interesting would probably horrify the author because, while he didn't say so in so many words, he apparently really believes that physics is, or can be, the answer to everything. I, on the other hand, believe there is a God, the Christian God, who has a hand in our existence.I have always thought it curious that descriptions of God or angels appearing to people seem to be accompanied by bright light and that the supernatural being just appears out of nowhere. Upon reflection this seemed to me very much like them coming out of another dimension. So, what to my surprise, some of the current notions coming out of physics is that reality consists of more dimensions than we currently are able to experience. Score one for angels appearing out of nowhere because they can move from another dimension into our 3-dimensional existence.Then there's the issue of God being omniscient, i.e. knowing everything, past, present, and future. OK, He's God, so I suppose he can know all that, but it seems kind of difficult to figure how He can know the future when it hasn't happened yet. So, what to my surprise again, I learn that physics suggests that space and time are not independent but should be considered spacetime. And (from page 452) ""that moments--the events making up the spacetime loaf--just are. They are timeless. Each moment--each event or happening--exists, just as each point in space exists."" So it appears that someone, God, for instance, who has extent in another dimension outside our spacetime, could presumably see all of our spacetime, past, present, and future. Wow!Now what about free will or agency? Christians believe that people can choose to do good or do evil and are therefore responsible for the consequences. On the other hand (from page 455), ""The laws of classical physics are deterministic. ...if you were to know precisely how things are now (the position and velocity of every particle in the universe), the laws of classical physics would tell you exactly how things were are would be at any other moment you specified. The equations are indifferent to the supposed freedom of human will."" So, according to classical physics, there is no such thing as agency or free will. But then along comes quantum theory and one view is (from page 456), ""...if the passage from probabilities to definite outcomes requires something beyond the standard quantum framework--it's at least possible that free will might find a concrete realization within physical law. We might one day find, as some physicists has speculated, that the act of conscious observation is an integral element of quantum mechanics, being the catalyst that coaxes one outcome from the quantum haze to be realized."" Greene goes on to say, ""Personally, I find this extremely unlikely, but I know of no way to rule it out."" He doesn't like it, but he has the honesty to admit that it's a possibility.Those who have faith that God exists don't, or shouldn't, need science to back Him up. But I've got to admit that it is nice when it does. Of course, as Greene points out, much of what physics proposes is theory that has not been experimentally verified. Some of the above may be supplanted in the future by other theories, but for the time being it is interesting that science seems to verify some of the attributes of God as understood by Christians."
82,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Once again, as in ""The Elegant Universe,"" Greene has done an exemplary job of presenting a ""popular"" explication of deep science (particle physics and cosmology) that is neither condescending nor watered down. I've been amazed both times than anyone could pull this off, since it's been attempted so often but left the subjects either impenetrable or eviscerated.Greene's salient attribute is clarity: He can find and present the basic contours of just about any scientific discipline in clear, disciplined, open outline. He employs several simple, elementary approaches to make this happen.• short, direct, declarative sentences: Beautiful writing with little waste.• analogy: His use of analogy to elucidate arcane concepts is spot on even when (especially when) the comparison seems initially off the wall. I can't, in any way, overestimate the worth of this ability. (Bertrand Russell made a hash of explaining relativity with a raft of confounding, muddying analogies.)• repetition: Greene presents an idea and its details from several different but complementary directions that both reinforce the underlying principles and keep them continually in mind. And he doesn't assume that once he's outlined a concept, you will automatically recall its ramifications three days later. Instead, when he refers to it again, he summarizes it quickly, as if reminding a friend walking with him down a forest path. • basic fairness: Greene has his biases (mostly in favor of string theory and its near relatives), which he never denies. But he gives full credit to the other theorists down the block, admits the failings of the theories he loves and the positive side of the others.• combining inside-outside views: Any enterprise can create a corporate worldview where what you're doing assumes a centrality that the rest of humanity might consider either scary or amusing. Greene is an insider, to different degrees, in the enterprises of mathematics, physics and string theory. Yet he does a pretty complete job of balancing the committed insider against the (more) objective outsider. He speaks equally well for himself, for the wider theoretical community, and to you, looking through the window. Greene's writing and willingness to share himself have grown since ""The Elegant Universe."" It shows most in his humor. He kept it under tight rein in the first work, but here it wanders out to laugh in the sun. ""The Simpsons"" in all their glory rollick throughout the book without apology, and the analogies often have a giggle in them that in no way limits their affect.Some of the elements I'd regretted being missed from ""The Elegant Universe"" are here in detail, in part because of the intervening half decade between publication, but I think more because that's what he's chosen here to add on. You've got dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs field (prior to the way-too-recent discovery of the Higgs boson), inflationary cosmology.I'm looking forward to reading his still more recent work."
83,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"Did Greene plagiarise a section of his book? More on that later.Oh, god, I'm surprised I finished it.

I'm not sure if I believe everything that theoretical physics proposes (but then again, I'm not one for blindly allowing myself to be pulled along by an entity I can't see), but I enjoy it nonetheless. And I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. Greene offers some thought provoking ideas, and he even mentions at one point the author of one of my favourite theoretical physics books,Lisa Randall. Unfortunately, Greene is unable to translate all his ideas into legible text. I was able to understand some of what he was saying, but after a while, my eyes started to glaze over and I was left puzzling my own existence. Greene tends to throw ideas out there (such as cracked eggs becoming whole again, or ice forming in a glass of warm water and then melting once more) without giving a warning, that leaves the reader wondering if perhaps Greene has lost his marbles in the search for truth. Furthermore, and this may be more a publisher's error, but the book promised discussion on black holes and the like- my favourite of all astronomical topics. However, black holes are only mentioned in depth in the last twenty odd pages. However, there was a chapter on time travel, wormholes and alternate universes, but that was only a short chapter in of itself.There was one segment I did catch that made me sit up and laugh. I only would have caught it because I read Flash Forward by Richard J. Sawyer shortly before this book. Greene and Sawyer both use the same analogy of Gone With the Wind as a way of describing looking through time, in exactly the same manner. Seeing as Sawyer wrote his novel first (back in 1999) and The Fabric of the Cosmos was written in 2004, I can only suspect that Greene was, er, inspired if you will to use it. Still, I'm sure Sawyer would appreciate the credit."
84,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Periodically I get inspired to read big science books aimed at clarifying things to laypeople without any maths. Generally, each time I get slightly further than I did the previous time before eventually losing focus and coasting to the end. This was one of those times. Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.Anyway. Some notes I took:The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!Maxwell/EinsteinMaxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.Quantum MechanicsLight tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.Part 2 - TimeTalks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.Quantum Mechanics + time.If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.CosmologyHubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of Back to the Future.Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. "
85,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"I wish I could say 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' is an easy read which makes clear a subject that only geniuses understand normally about what classic physics and quantum mechanics have to do with understanding the mysteries of cosmology, particularly the theories regarding what the universe is, how it began, what made it function the way it does and why there seems to be an arrow of Time. I can't. Physics is too hard for me. However, Brian Greene is a brilliant man with a teacher's magic talent of sussing out how to simplify and explain difficult complexities of scientific thought. His book 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' did not lose me until the final six chapters! Gentle reader, I highly recommend this book.Physics is not only about observations and experiments, it is mostly about interpreting horribly complicated maths. Fortunately, Brian Greene leaves the math for the 'Notes' section in the back of this book while describing through analogies and simple-as-possible, and logical, well-written historical vignettes about the key physics discoveries by famous physicists which illuminate the nature of space and time. Each step of increasing scientific knowledge important to cosmology is described in a logical procession of conclusions, facts and theories, chapter by chapter. I finally understood many much briefer and out-of-context explanations in science articles which I have occasionally read. (However, I think I will not remember much of this enlightenment in a few weeks, alas.)The newest theories and guesses, described in chapters 12-16, about three-branes and brane splats, extra dimensions, string theory holograms, super-symmetry particle spinning, potential energy bowls, free will (yes, I said free will), five-string theories, two 'Big Bang' theories, and loop quantum gravity, by these genius scientists are the hardest of all to understand by this ordinary mortal, gentle reader, but perseverance with 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' DID make a small collapse of probabilities in the jittering mass of my excited brain particles so that this cat was radiant with more intelligence upon exiting the ebook. Unfortunately, though, I have a feeling this enlightenment is but a moon's dim reflective glow, gone as soon as the sun rises."
86,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is a nice overview of modern physics, including implications of relativity (specific and general), quantum mechanics and string theory, together with a discussion of the implications for cosmology. Some of the interesting items discussed here include the notion that during the ""Planck time"", ie, 10^(-34) sec or so after the Big Bang, space and time had no meaning, that our 3-D universe may be only an illusion of an underlying 11-dimensional universe, and reality may be coded in a cosmic ""hologram"", and that our universe may be only a minor dot in an incomparably vaster ""multiverse"".My own objection to this book is that most of this material has been written elsewhere -- for starters, Greene's earlier book ""The Elegant Universe"" was an excellent introduction to string theory and its implications. That's a problem with writing a great book -- it's hard to match the same level of excitement in the next book.The other criticism that one might raise is that string theory and the multiverse, in particular, remain highly controversial in the field. Indeed, some scientists (such as Lee Smolin) are saying out loud that string theory has been given too much rope for too long, and it is time to face the reality that it has not produced any crisp, testable hypotheses (nor is it likely to for a while). For the same reasons, many are opposed to the notion of the ""multiverse"", not just for technical reasons but also for philosophical reasons -- how can the hypothesis of an infinity of companion universes, whose existence can only be indirectly suggested, even in principle, qualify as empirical science?"
87,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel,5,"The book focused mainly on the concepts of space and time, and how they build the universe around us. Starting with the concept of space and how that's changed over the years, then time and how that's changed and now the concept of spacetime, and then the universe itself. A large part of the book was used trying to explain, ""time's arrow"" why things go forward but never backwards, why entropy is always greater in the future and never the past. It was all very interesting. At times I did get a bit lost, though not that often, but I feel now I have a much better understanding of a lot of modern physics concepts and ideas, for example I know understand Pbranes user name! I never really understood the big bang, that the universe was expanding, not that things were just getting flung further out into space. I think inflationary cosmology is neat. (even if it doesn't tie everything together). The chapter I enjoyed the most I think had to be looking at the teleportation and possibilities of time travel in the future. It was definitely more on the what if end of physics, but it was very interesting and I really enjoyed his explanations for why there would be no paradox. But it's definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in learning how the universe might work, and how in a lot of ways it does. It made a nice change for me to read a book about a subject I know so little about. While I cannot therefore give an expert opinion about it's accuracy, it was fascinating and I feel like I understand the world a lot more now."
88,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-ivan-vukovi,5,"This is as fine (or very near) as popular physics goes. Although the book is maybe a bit too simple at times, I really enjoyed how Greene is able to present some very difficult concepts by gradually building up ideas. Instead of jumping over here and over there, he leads the reader in a very precise (well, as precise as you can get without serious mathematics) and logical manner which seems to be satisfying both to the layman and to the expert. Excellent!"
89,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37678060-gary,5,"One of the pop-sci books I have read, with the best explanations of string theory, hidden dimensions, and the scientific struggle to understand the cosmos. "
90,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"I like to talk shit about science sometimes. Sometimes it's just to push people's buttons and other times it's because of the pop side of science is ridiculous (you know like the studies that get quoted on your web-browsers start-up page, which may even be contradicted a few days from now by some other article, or all those fucking pharmaceutical ad's on TV. Hey, thanks Pfizer for helping make me a drug addict!). I just made a slight at pop-science and that is hypocritical of me, it's really the only type of science I can understand and this book basically falls into that category, it's a watered down version of real science so humanities idiots like me can understand concepts that they would stare open mouthed at if they had to read the actual articles about. By the way, I loved this book! Starting with a seemingly simple problem (or I would think it's simple, but it took a few hundred years and Einstein to adequately understand it, apparently (not that I could figure it out) about why the water in a bucket pushes up against the side of the bucket when you spin the bucket around really fast, Brian Green creates a narrative (I'm using this in it's normal manner, not in the science as narrative way that I use it when I want to piss people off, this book is a history of science book in quite a few ways) that shows how this bucket filled with some water paved the way for Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Uncertainty, the Big Bang, String Theory, M-Theory, Branes and other concepts that helped move forward theoretical understandings of the whole universe. Oh, actually the underlying theme to the book is how do we understand the concepts of space and time, or spacetime, which is one of the problems of understanding why the water in the bucket does what it does when it is spun around. Oh, did I mention I loved this book? I feel awkward giving it five stars because I lack the critical acumen to know if Brian Green is really telling the whole story, or if there is a huge bias here because I'm an idiot when it comes to matters like this. I felt like he was being fair though but maybe I was just dazzled by any of the mathematics he would throw into footnotes that I wouldn't have the first idea on what to do with if someone handed me even the simplest one and asked me to solve it. About a hundred pages into the book I had the realization that I should have been more interested in math and science growing up. More exactly I had the realization that the way math and science were taught in the schools I attended did nothing to inspire me at all. I'm fairly certain that most people never use most of the information they learn in science classes. I've never had the need to know all the parts of a flower, but if I had been taught something about what went into discovering some of the biology of (x) or say about the real awesomeness of evolution I'd probably have perked up and gotten interested. Or maybe learned about the difficulties still facing scientists when dealing with the subatomic level, and the weirdness of quantum uncertainty and entanglement might have gotten me more interested and wanting to know more in a chemistry class than endlessly learning how to balance electrons between elements (or whatever that fruitless exercise was called). I know these details are really important to doing science, but without any reason to care about wanting to know about science this is all just monumental busy work. Shouldn't it be the job of schools to get kids to care and wanting to learn rather than forcing meaningless facts onto them? This rantish aside about the misguided importance (pedological approach?) of science education in American schools was just me being bitter. It's too late now, and I'm too dumb in too many areas of knowledge but I should have been a theoretical physicist. That is what I realized reading this book. I wish someone had told me about the weird shit these people try to figure out, explained who Parmenides was and the basic gist of his Poem was, and then told me I could work on these problems for the rest of my life if I started to pay attention in math class and gave a shit about my science classes, that there was cool stuff I'd get to later on. Parmenides is never mentioned in this book, but at almost every step through the book he kept popping into my mind. He's my reoccurring fascination. His idea of the everything just being One at first glance is so silly. I remember the first time reading Zeno's Paradoxes (he was Parmenides student) and thinking they were just silly games with words, obviously something moves faster than something else and can over come it. Obviously an arrow shot at a target eventually hits it. Duh! But sometime soon after my immediate annoyance at these kinds of meaningless games something clicked in me and I started to try to think through what Parmenides could mean by the whole universe being an unchanging, undivisible, timeless thing. A point, if you would. On one level Parmenides can be thought of as the logical foil to the pre-Socratic materialists, the voice that says your theory is nice but what about (x)? I don't buy into the idea that was Parmenides only goal though. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know exactly what Parmenides thought, because of thanks to those motherfucking Christians and Moslems (you know for their multiple burnings of the Library of Alexandria (and Christians for their wanton destruction of 'heretical' literature) we have only a scant few fragments left from Parmenides work, and most of it is second hand from the post-Socratic arch-materialist Aristotle (materialist meaning something sort of different in the Ancient Greek sense than one would think of a materialist today). Are you bored yet?Anyway, back to Parmenides, I don't buy the idea that his role was only as foil, or goad to the materialists to make their theories more logically consistent. Why? Because of Plato. Socrates is bested only twice in the dialogues. First as a young man by Parmenides of Elea (the guy I've been writing about) in Parmenides and second by the Eleatic Stranger in The Sophist and The Statesman (these two dialogues are like a part one and part two to each other). The appearance of the Eleatic Stranger is in the two dialogues that come at the end of Socrates life, before the series of dialogues that make up the trial and death of Socrates. In both instances Socrates is bested in his arguments by the philosophy coming from Elea. Why? Why is the only person who Plato allows to give Socrates a philosophical beat-down either Parmenides or a stand in for him? (Parmenides himself couldn't be in a chronologically later dialogue, since he was an old man when Socrates was a youth). Anyway, long story that doesn't mean too much to anyone probably, but to sum it up Parmenides has been an thought game for me for years now, and many of the ideas that I've had to reconcile what Parmenides means I find in this fucking book, there are people who are seriously considering some of the logical games I play in my head about cosmology, but they have math and ways of actually coming up with answers! I haven't done a good job at it, but to me this is so exciting. It's like all of the crazy shit that philosophers have thought up over the years can be actually studied and not just argued about using a mismash of concepts and logic, but possibly measured and articulated with math and shit! This book is like a validation to the stuff I think about when I'm not just wallowing in self-pity or being sad. Of course, I knew that a lot of this stuff existed before reading this book, but I had no idea what any of it really meant. I just took the words and applied common meanings to them. String Theory? Oh, everything is interconnected with vibrating strings. Actually, no. That's not what String Theory means. Multi-dimensions, you mean like people could be living in a dimension almost on top of me that I don't see because I don't have access to those dimensions, but one day maybe we could, right? No, actually even if the dimensions are big, the word big is being used on a microscopic scale, like the width of a piece of hair big, as opposed to small as in so small we have nothing that can see it. I realized that most of the ways books in the new age section use science terms to validate their ideas and how they claim to be drawing on cutting edge research is bullshit, that they are just picking terms out and using them in ways to sell books on hokum. I realized reading this book that I wish I wasn't so stupid and that I could at least understand this stuff at more than in a non-technical watered down way."
91,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"Did you know that Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect anagram of “A Second Herring Quits”? And is a near perfect anagram of “Surely someone’s taking the piss”? The second anagram relies, of course (and almost entirely), on a rather judicious application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – but I do think that one may be more illuminating of how I’m finding some of the quantum mechanical experiments described in this book. There is part of me that would like to believe that in the early part of the last century (I don’t remember the year, but surely on an April First) a group of European physicists got together and decided to come up with an idea so monumentally ridiculous that it would have them chuckling at the gullibility of we more mathematically challenged for years to come. Einstein was in on the joke at the start, but ended up thinking it had all gone on for far too long. Frynman introduced some slapstick into the equations (in a fine American tradition) – but, as always, it takes an Irishman (John Bell) to put the final touches on the comedy and to make it truly surreal. So, why isn’t anybody laughing?If you are not disturbed by the findings of Quantum Mechanics, well, you’re really not trying hard enough. This is quite some book so far.UpdateOkay, I’ve finished and I’ve had problems with this one. In fact, I have many problems with modern physics and believe that the only way I could really understand it more would be to go back and finish off a degree in this stuff. Since I’m unlikely to do that, I am going to have to accept that this stuff will have to remain a mystery to me. This guy really does try to make this stuff accessible, but I’ve a feeling that without the maths it just does not make any sense on any level.My problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that every time there is a problem in Physics we are having trouble solving we just make up something invisible to solve it. Universe not expanding fast enough? Stuff it full of dark matter. Expanding too fast? Bring back the Cosmological Constant. Can’t make gravity fit in with quantum theory? Postulate string theory. Having trouble with quantum theory? Why not create an infinite number of universes that can’t access each other. Having trouble explaining the vibrations of one dimensional strings? Vibrate them in 11 dimensional space.Bring back the Ether, I say. Physics never seems to do anything by half. Even cosmic inflation seems to have inflated the universe to a ridiculous extent in the first nanosecond of the universe.I don’t believe I can really say anything sensible about any of this stuff. It is so far divorced from my limited understanding that to express an opinion really just makes me feel incredibly ignorant. Like I said, I’m not prepared to learn the maths, so I should just shut up. It is a pity physics has become so esoteric – I would like to be one of its great defenders, to use it as a basis to understand the universe, but I come away from these books feeling someone is having me on.This is a good book, in part. Some of it is still remarkably hard going – even with the allusions to the Simpsons and X Files (I’ve never seen the X Files or some of the other bits of pop culture mentioned, so that made what I took to be some of the jokes quite inaccessible to me – but that will just be me). The stuff about Newton’s Bucket was utterly fascinating and well worth reading. The stuff of string theory was like most stuff on string theory – I’ve virtually no understanding of this stuff and can’t quite follow the controversy that surrounds it. Anyway, it sounds like no one will ever be able to test any of this stuff – if we can’t see an electron how the hell are we ever going to see a one dimensional string?My main problem with this book was his early explanation of entropy and how this did not provide an arrow of time. He says that if you watch a film of an egg falling and braking that you could reverse the film and there is nothing in the laws of physics to decide which direction the film travelled in that must be the right direction. He says that there would be a way to get all the bits of egg to fly back at the right speed and reconstitute. This, of course, is nonsense. It is not a matter of things coming back together at the right speed that is the issue. Have you ever broken a glass? You don’t get the pieces to go back together again by moving them together at the ‘right speed’. They never go back together again. This is a one way reaction. Why? Because once the glass is broken the bonds between the atoms in the glass are broken. Pushing the pieces together again is pushing negatively charged electrons against negatively charged electrons and they will repeal each other, not just nicely bond. There are laws of physics and laws of chemistry that do not allow this reversal. I figure that if I have spotted a flaw in this easy bit of his argument there are too many bits of this argument that I struggled to follow that may be just as equally flawed. (This stuff is from about page 145 – 169)I did learn some interesting stuff from this book – even about entropy. I had no idea that the arrow of entropy was double headed or that inflation was the main cause of order in the young universe. But large parts of this book deal with questions that are simply too esoteric. I ended up knowing that I would never know what was in a black hole or what caused the big bang and basically not really caring. I’m sure this wasn’t Greene’s intention, more is the pity."
92,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Wow, what a wonderful book. What a ride it was. Brian is definitely one of the best science popularisers about, hands down. It is amazing how he manages to convey potentially complex subjects, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, in a simple but at the same time rigorous manner. And he does that with a contagious enthusiasm which reminded to me why I love physics. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he never gets into the game (like so frequently happens in popular science books, unfortunately) of oversimplifying the subject. His book is very readable and he has a great gift of explaining complex subjects with an amazing clarity. While the book may be a bit too simple at times, more quantitative detail is available in the notes at the end of the book (which I strongly recommend you read, to get more detail), and bibliographic references are pretty good. It is a fantastic introductory book to the realm of contemporary physics - of course, if you are interested in more quantitative treatments of such subjects, then this is probably not the book for you - although I must say that everybody with an interest in science should really take the time to read this masterpiece. The author, being a foremost scientist directly involved in the most advanced research efforts in areas such as String Theory, does have his own preferences and biases (all honestly acknowledged by him, and also they do not impact the overall objectivity and impartiality of his book). Moreover, being particle physics an area of such intense and frantic development, there are a couple of area where the book looks a bit dated (for example, even if SUSY is not officially dead, the results coming out of the LHC are such that there is increasing doubt over the real prospects of SUSY and consequently of Super String Theories - although it is completely premature to claim that they are dead).Overall, it is an amazing introductory book, informative, entertaining, lucid, and a complete pleasure to read.

This feeling, this sensation that time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments—previous frames—to be ""sequentially illuminated.""﻿In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian GreeneI agree that this is at least as much philosophy as science, though mathematically based philosophy. But what irks me is that for all the pages of science books devoted to this subject, no one has pointed out that for us to experience moments sequentially (assuming those moments don't themselves move) our mind has to move through those moments. And movement entails time. So while time may be a spatial dimension, if Greene (and Godel, etc.) are right, then there must be at least one other dimension of time that allows our minds to move through the different moments that all exist and experience them sequentially.﻿"
94,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Let's start with the positives: Greene does an excellent job of explaining very hard-to-understand concepts in non-mathematical ways. That said, I think it was unecessary to use popular culture the way he did. It feels silly, reading about Einstein and general relativity and getting an example which uses the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart, and Lisa and so forth. But okay, I admit that this is a fairly small detail that shouldn't take too much away from the overall experience. The important thing is that the concepts are explained in a manner which is understandable. Does Greene do that? He does, for the most part.Furthermore, Greene is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and that is something that is contagious. Reading about the bucket argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_a...) and the various attempts at answering it; the exciting exploration of time, the arrow of time, and its mysteries; the exhilarating explanation of entropy; the outline of general relativity, quantum mechanics and a whole host of other physical theories, and on the whole Greene's passionate way of writing makes this an extremely engaging read. And the subject matter is interesting. I mean, the bending of space and time, particles being ""entangled"" (""spooky action at a distance"") through space, possible hidden dimensions, elusive particles, multiverses.. Paul Erdos said that ""if numbers aren't beautiful, I don't know what is."" Well, if this stuff isn't interesting, I don't know what is! Thus, overall, the book is extremely engaging and exciting, and it's one of those books that are very much, in many ways, unputdownable. Now, the negatives.First of all, the illustrations are almost no help, because they are of awful quality. I read the hardcover version, and even here they are small, with no colour and in fairly awful quality. Another problem with the book has been pointed out in this review as well, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... You get the impression that without the math, a lot of this just isn't really possible to convey properly. You are left with only a part of the picture. I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's words: ""To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."" Sometimes Greene is pretty frank about this. He'll essentially write, ""okay, I know this is far-fetched, but trust me on this one: the math is right, guys."" To Greene's credit, there are a lot of pages in the back of the book devoted to the more mathematically inclined reader, so that those who do get it can check it out for themselves. Now, the last negative aspect of the book is the fact that there's not a whole lot of new things here. If you've read The Elegant Universe, you don't really get a whole lot of new knowledge, except that this book is less about string theory and more about cosmology. I think it's enough to read one of them, which kind of renders this book somewhat unecessary. With all those negatives aside, the book is enjoyable and engaging. If you want some stretching exercises for your imagination, it's not a mistake to pick it up."

""Theoretically there is no absolute proof that one's awakening in the morning (the finding oneself again in the saddle of one's personality) is not really a quite unprecedented event, a perfectly original birth."" Yeah, that does make a bit more sense than most of this book. . . . I'm starting to wish I never listed this here because if I hadn't I could give up without feeling so bad (or anyone knowing). It's not that he's a bad writer it's just that I'm not that smart, but I suppose we all have own unique talents, right?

96,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"You probably know more about physics than you think. See, right there, when your brain registered the p-word, a black hole of anxiety opened up in the pit of your stomach from which nothing can escape. Your underarms began to radiate heat as your mind conjured memories of stuffy high school laboratories. And as your eyes scanned ahead for those dreaded half-English, half-Greek words followed by an equal sign, the probability of you reading on fast approached zero.But there’s hope! Whether you realize it or not, you just visualized some of the more important natural phenomena that govern the world around us. The stomachache was space-time curvature at a point of infinite density. The sweating was a crass simulation of something known as black body radiation. And your waning interest was a metaphor for quantum non-locality. What do these words mean? It doesn’t really matter. Even complicated physical processes were surmountable — even understandable — when they were put into the context of something familiar, say, traumatic experiences of young adulthood.Without analogy and metaphor, a reader can quickly suffocate in the rarified air of the hard sciences. The task then for any science writer is to couch these concepts in colloquial terms and familiar experiences, and no one does it better than Brian Greene. His second of two books, The Fabric of the Cosmos, is a potent distillation of 200 years of discovery and an invaluable roadmap of reality that is almost impossible to get lost with, regardless of your level of scientific knowledge. It is a compelling narrative of the search for understanding that probes the boundaries of human experience. Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, is not the first to attempt such a crash course in physics history and experiment for the non-science minded, and he won’t be the last. In fact, the popularity of this breed of book has even necessitated its own genre, which has come to be known as pop-physics. Make no mistake; it is truly a difficult task to make the revolutionary ideas of hundreds of brilliant people not only digestible, but palatable in fewer than 500 pages. Since you can’t change the elements of the story — an exhaustive historical record of dozens of collaborating countries — good science writing then becomes an exercise in conversational skills, patient instruction and plenty of examples.Greene is adept at all three but his skillful employment of examples is one of the book’s greatest strengths. Throughout the text, he uses objects we experience and protagonists we can visualize to illustrate his points. The Simpsons characters, Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, and former President Bill Clinton all appear on multiple occasions and eggs, snowflakes and bowling balls all serve as props. As juvenile as this might seem, you would be surprised at how effective Greene’s methods are. At one point in the book, he tries to explain how something called the Higgs ocean — typically the focus of a Ph.D. thesis — may give particles like protons and electrons their mass. But he uses a very familiar and somewhat playful example to illustrate the point. “If [a particle] has greater difficulty accelerating through the Higgs ocean, it has a greater mass. If we liken a particle’s mass to a person’s fame, then the Higgs ocean is like the paparazzi: those who are unknown pass through the swarming photographers with ease, but famous politicians and movie stars have to push much harder to reach their destination.”While this technique of using vivid examples seems straight forward, it is actually very easy to mess up and there are a few cardinal sins that many physics authors commit. A common transgression is to sacrifice accuracy for sensationalism under the misconception that science fiction is the only way to engage the average reader. The very talented Michio Kaku of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (the same place Einstein spent the last few decades of his life) is a repeat offender. His most recent work of pop-physics, called Hyperspace, contains examples that are shamelessly unscientific at times and really underestimate the reader’s intelligence.But by no means does Greene dumb down the information in Fabric and yet, none of the underlying ideas are lost. Further, he doesn’t resort to sensationalized hypothetical situations but instead finds a creative way to make the reader appreciate real scientific results. In doing so, he makes it more than understandable. He makes the reader appreciate and even enjoy the excitement of discovery.And if Greene’s delivery of concepts is superb, his thoughtful selection of content only reinforces the readability of the text. The fundamental — and most impressive — difference between Greene and most other science writers is the breadth of the issues he addresses. Another cardinal sin for a science writer is to allow a topic’s complexity to dictate its relevance, which is just a cop out and a disservice to the reader. Gary Zukov, the author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, basically left out entire chapters of vital experimental findings because they were too tough to couch in human experience. But Greene doesn’t succumb to such temptations of writing around difficult material. He acknowledges the complexity of problematic topics and painstakingly walks the reader through the material every time.Unfortunately, some concepts will be beyond analogy and word craft and require at least a cursory digression of technicalities. As Greene puts it: “Human language is far better at capturing human experience than at expressing deep physical laws.” But what is unique about Fabric is that Greene gives the reader the option to get more technical without a loss of continuity. Throughout the text, he would broach a huge topic by putting it into historical context and discussing its relevance in the big physics picture. Often, the section would end with an ultimatum: keep reading to explore the details for a deeper understanding or skip to the next chapter with at least these implications in mind. This “choose your own adventure” organization gives the book a refreshing flexibility that is too often absent from pop-physics novels.Writing style also plays a large role in this work’s success. Richard Feynman, one of the more beloved albeit quirky physicists of the 20th century, was famous for his conversational style physics lessons. Though this made Feynman an incredibly effective educator, he was never able to write a book for want of literary chops. Fabric is such a good read because Greene buttresses the same savvy teaching techniques with an eloquent style of storytelling. Some parts are downright poetic and they uncover the easily missed romance and excitement of scientific discovery. He writes, “By deepening our understanding of the true nature of physical reality, we profoundly reconfigure our sense of ourselves and our experience of the universe.” And other parts are surprisingly suspenseful, especially for a narrative with such well-publicized plot twists. Even though most people know that Albert Einstein would propose his groundbreaking theories of relativity in the early 1900s, until Greene gets to that part of the story, this reader was genuinely concerned about the troublesome relationship between absolute space and time. (Spoiler: It all works out beautifully!)One of the more striking features of The Fabric of the Cosmos is how Greene’s enthusiasm for modern physics almost leaps off the page, making the reader wonder, if only for a second, whether or not the Large Hadron Collider will actually produce spontaneous symmetry breaking of massive scalar bosons. But that’s beside the point. To wonder about the world around us is the first step on the path to scientific discovery and Greene’s work makes it so that anyone can find the way."

Get me into anything more than general commentary, discoveries, famous names and famous theories, and I'm completely at a loss. Green is a likable and passionate author, but for readers without a physics knowledge base, his little treatise is tough going, even with all the Simpsons references. I remember the most important concepts, but the intricacies didn't stick with me. This book is best read in segments, preferably when you're completely lucid and can take notes. "

Sacks, Sagan, Ramachandran, Richard Simmons, etc. I had never heard of Brian Greene and have typically held physics and such things at arm's length, with my other hand pinching my nose shut as if holding the world's most curious diaper: there is probably much of interest within to parse out, but noxious enough to keep me anyway. This book was recommended to me (okay, it was a present) by a friend who seems to be aware of my constant questioning of the nature of the very fabric of reality itself. Luckily, this book squares a lot of things and sets them to rights for me.Greene is an awesome writer. He's funny and he describes this complicated shizz really well (he likes to make Simpsons analogies). There are few parts that are mind-bending to the point where I got a headache. Greene will outright warn you to skip ahead if its getting too dense, which is nice.As to the actual content? Fuck, it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I'll just say, I came out of the book feeling and sounding smarter. I can rap about three-branes, the Many Worlds hypothesis and impress my friends with my knowledge of the eleven spacetime dimensions.All-in-all, satisfying, funny, and informative."

This book was not the answer to my acquisition of knowledge. In fact, I learned almost nothing from this book. The writing is awful. It seeks to explain through dense prose, repetitive text, asinine pop references and endless in text questions. It really just shows why science writers should write books for the general public, not most scientists. Further, the author is in love with his superstring research and theory, but never convinced me it actually exists. All in all, it’s hard for me to express my disgust with this book. At least my nightmare and dread of reading on with this book have come to an end. I will never read this author again and may just avoid cosmos and superstring science if there’s no better work out there. "
100,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Glancing at the reviews for Brian Greene's overview of how we view the stuff of which our universe is made, it seems that some people base their rating and opinion on how much they agree with the science, or how credible they find it. While I have read a fair few popular science books – especially in the areas of physics and cosmology, areas I find utterly fascinating and about which I am perplexed that anyone can not be astounded and beguiled – I have to assume that I am reading a fair explanation of facts and theories. That is not to say that I assume the author is more knowledgeable than me simply because he has more letters after his name, but because he grounds his claims with background and the weight of evidence that is needed for a scientific hypothesis to become a generally accepted theory. Also, I have taken the effort to educate myself in these areas so have enough grounding myself to be able to appreciate the arguments.That said, for much of this book I'm unsure how much background would be needed to understand the explanations. Greene writes with a clarity and readability which is all too rare in any field, and is particularly welcome in discussing such big ideas. As in Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, Greene completely dispenses with calculations but, unlike Hawking, he also tries to keep the use of metaphor to a minimum. It cannot, of course, be dispensed with completely – metaphors are an extraordinarily powerful descriptive tool, especially in a field that can only properly be explained and understood using specialist mathematics – but for the most part Greene simply gives an overview of each field in historical context, and explains WHY it is important, what it explains and why it works.He starts – as modern physics in so many fields must – with Isaac Newton, and particularly Newton's Bucket. If you hang a bucket of water on a rope and twist the rope, as the rope unwinds, spinning the bucket, at first the water remains stationary until the friction of the bucket's movement makes the water begin to spin. When it does, the surface becomes increasingly concave, moved outward by what why now call centripetal (or centrifugal) force. But what, asked Newton, is the water moving away from, or toward? What is it moving in relation to? He decided that it moved in relation to the fixed fabric of the cosmos, the stuff in which the matter (that he recognised as being the thing on which gravity works) sits. Recognising that he had no way of testing this medium by experiment, Newton took this is an immutable absolute and left it at that. Greene keeps returning to the bucket and its implications throughout the book, to superb explanatory effect.I won't go further into the details (read the book!), but simply say that thanks to Professor Greene I now understand areas of cosmology and physics where I had previously had to simply give in to brain cramp and accept as being true. I understand why the speed of light (actually, the speed of any electromagnetic radiation) is approx 300, 000 km/sec faster than you, no matter how fast you are travelling. I understand a whole lot more about General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and why they make sense and are such powerful tools in describing our universe. I understand that Inflationary Theory is not merely a tweak of Big Bang theory to enable it to fit observed facts, but a whole new way of looking at the growth of the universe that actually explains much more about the fundamental physics.I'm not claiming a thorough understanding of these subjects (and in some, like Brane Theory, I still found myself rather lost; a re-read may be in order), but I feel that The Fabric of the Cosmos has deepened my comprehension of and appreciation for the wonders of our universe. And for the wonders of the human mind to work out these things. In around three hundred years we have developed this system, science, as a means of examining the world around us in a way which is comprehensible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. All books on science now seem to feel the need to restate this about science; it is NOT knowledge passed down from on high by men in white coats using deliberately obfuscatory language for reasons of either professional pride or conspiracy. Science is a method that enables us to understand more and more about the world, to revel in the joy of knowing how the rainbow is formed as well as in its simple beauty. No idea in science is sacrosanct, no theory is holy. To achieve the status of acceptance of say, General Relativity or Evolution by Natural Selection, a theory has to be tested – that is, it has to survive again and again and again the onslaught of people systematically trying to prove it wrong. When a weakness is found the theory must be re-examined. Sometimes the fault will cause the foundations of the theory to crumble, and it will be discarded; it has still served a purpose, to show how promising such an approach is. Sometimes finding the errors will strengthen a theory and teach us more – Edwin Hubble's original calculations of distant galaxies seemed to show the universe to be about 1.5 billion years old, despite lots of other evidence at the time insisting it was at least 3 billion years old (as we now know, this was still almost five times too conservative). Everything else about Hubble's observation and theory made sense, there was simply an error in calculating the distance of the super novae he was using to get the figures, a correction which itself taught us much about the universe.And this is incredibly important to realise because, while many theories, however much work they take, partly make sense on an intuitive level you get to Quantum and Brane theory and they simply cannot – in fact they seem, by intuition and everyday experience, utterly ridiculous (the great physicist Nils Bor said something along the lines of “if you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory”) but they are undoubtedly right. One important way a theory is tested is to use it to make predictions in the physical world and Quantum Theory has been called far and away the most successful predictive theory in science. It is, like every successful theory, one that accurately describes the way our universe works, with the limits of perception and understanding we have, which is why theories are modified or discarded when new information comes along. Which is why General Relativity replaced Newton's Laws of Gravitation as the best description we have for how gravity works – although NASA still use Newton's calculations most of the time, for the same reason you don't need to understand Gaussian Quadratic Maths to balance your chequebook.Greene's book, the first I've read by him, shows why it is worth reading a range of books on the same (or closely connected) areas of science. While in The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinov managed to convey a sense of wonder and discovery on a par with Carl Sagan's writings (a plaudit I don't throw around lightly!), Greene has given us a book that manages a clarity and depth of explanation while being a thoroughly entertaining read. At schools, perhaps instead of training our children into narrowly defined roles, science classes should just be introducing them to the works of Greene and Hawking, Sagan and Tyson (Neil deGrasse, not Mike) and Krauss to show them how huge and wonderful and beautiful the universe is, and how much joy and fulfilment can be achieved through our efforts to understand it."
101,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,5,"What an incredible journey this was. I think Brian is fantastically gifted to explain esoteric and cutting-edge cosmological concepts without the use of formulae and maths. He says himself that he will only use metaphors to explain the ideas, but even so he remains respectful of his subject, he does not dumb things down, and I found the metaphors for the most part evocative and helpful. Towards the end of the book, however, the ideas get so far removed from human intuition that I would have wanted a little more formalism, perhaps. But - this was on offer as well! Brian adds a copious body of footnotes and in this way relegates a more rigorous discussion to the back of the book. This discussion will of course still not satisfy those who have an in-depth understanding of the science involved, but I don't think they are the target group of this book in the first place. To me, this was the best account of the current state (well, it's ten years old, but close enough) of cosmology I have read. The field appears to be so fast-moving that some of his statements in the later chapters have already been overtaken by reality, but there is a special charm in hearing Brian suggest that the LIGO experiment may demonstrate the existence of gravitational waves in decades to come when you know that this has already happened, much sooner than he thought. Equally, I felt a pang of regret when he expresses optimism that the LHC runs may find evidence of extra spatial dimensions soon after the upgrade to higher energies, knowing this has not happened yet, and scepticism is mounting that it ever will.Transcending what Brian was actually teaching me about the science, I also had an epiphany when I was reading the book. Brian talks at length about the shortcomings of the Big Bang theory, and explains how the theory of inflation may answer some of its more frustrating issues, such as the flatness problem. The flatness problem highlights the issue that a tiny difference in origin conditions would have generated a universe entirely different from the one we observe today. Now, I have always thought that this is no mystery, the fact that we are here to observe this universe is the reason we may puzzle about these finetuned conditions, but they are just one in many, equally possible, universes, and our surprise is therefore of our own making. I even thought this position was enlightened, and quite clever. But Brian explained that physicists abhor theories that rely on unknown qualities, on axiomatic pronouncements that accept something as a given. I understood that only by asking ""why"" were physicists able to develop a theory that explains the finetuning, and go beyond the Big Bang as the creation theory of the universe. And this was an excellent lesson to me. I think I knew this once, but I had forgotten about it. In my case, my anthropic stance was actually an attempt on my part to avoid a deeper question, an attempt to posit an answer where there wasn't one yet. Brian reminded me that we must never stop asking ""why"", that asking ""why"" is what makes us human. I loved this book. I can only recommend it to anybody who does not have a formal degree in science and wants to learn more about cosmology but is a bit frustrated about the lack of depth popular accounts of this topic typically provide."

Greene avoids both. This is hands down the best popular intro to modern physics I've found. Even with half a B.S. in physics and formal courses on many of the topics covered, this book consistently kept my interest and taught me new things.Two unique aspects of this book I haven't found elsewhere are (1) its focus on space and time and (2) its enthusiasm. As for (1), most pop sci books on physics focus on trying to convey one or more specific theories (quantum theory, special relativity, string theory, etc) and may discuss space or time in the context of one of these theories but don't make connections between them. Greene actually makes space and time the main character of this story and follows them throughout history and across theories. As for (2), not since Richard Feynman have I found a physicist whose writing makes me shiver with childish delight at the wonders of the universe. Some might find his poetic geeky gushes cheesy, but others (like myself) will spend the next several evenings lying outside on their lawns, staring at the stars, and just basking in the awesomeness of it all.That said, don't expect a book without mathematics to convey a full picture of our current understanding of physics. Nature seems to be written most naturally in the language of mathematics and that is the language in which she must be read. Hopefully though, if you haven't gotten over a particularly frightening encounter with mathematics as a young impressionable child, this book will convince you that it's worth doing.If you:

   are interested in modern physics but don't know where to start 
   have read a few pop sci books or many pop sci articles but want to see how many of the ideas fit together 
   or curious about our past and current understanding of space and time

104,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This was as very confounding book to me - not confusing but confounding. It has some amazing observations and conundrums to ponder over and I suspect I did not appreciate (or even understand all that it had to tell me).Let me explain - some of the chapters used examples - some of which I have actually studied in my years in education. For example the example where electrons can be treated as particles while at the same time be treated as waves. Now I remember the experiments and I remember the theory that went with them. But I did not associated them with the bigger picture being presented in the chapter. And so the reason why I am confounded- this book challenges many of the scientific notions, a few it takes and builds upon them often reinforcing the notions it is trying to convey. And yet reading this book I feel there is so much more to learn and understand (including some of the sections in the book itself). Ironically looking back at my education I realise that rather than trying to build a foundation for me to build upon I feel like it have been shown how little I know and how so much there is still to explore and learn.Books like this have a variety of effects on me - but this is the first to make me feel so small in the scheme of things. But rather than making it feel a negative experience its almost like a reassurance that you are part of everything and in the right place. As I have said earlier there is more to be learnt from this book - but for now I need let my mind rest as its had a bit of a work out reading these pages. "

Most of the esoteric stuff is banished to the footnotes, which are well worth reading--and I suppose I should be happy that it's there at all, since most books on modern science are written with Hawking's Editor's Law in mind: with each equation, your audience shrinks by 90%.

I think some of it actually did sink in, so I'm going to recommend this to anyone who desires a primer on the advances in physics & cosmology since e=mc2 but doesn't want to read a bunch of equations."

I, on the other hand, believe there is a God, the Christian God, who has a hand in our existence.I have always thought it curious that descriptions of God or angels appearing to people seem to be accompanied by bright light and that the supernatural being just appears out of nowhere.

So, what to my surprise, some of the current notions coming out of physics is that reality consists of more dimensions than we currently are able to experience. Score one for angels appearing out of nowhere because they can move from another dimension into our 3-dimensional existence.Then there's the issue of God being omniscient, i.e. knowing everything, past, present, and future. OK, He's God, so I suppose he can know all that, but it seems kind of difficult to figure how He can know the future when it hasn't happened yet. So, what to my surprise again, I learn that physics suggests that space and time are not independent but should be considered spacetime. And (from page 452) ""that moments--the events making up the spacetime loaf--just are. They are timeless. Each moment--each event or happening--exists, just as each point in space exists."" So it appears that someone, God, for instance, who has extent in another dimension outside our spacetime, could presumably see all of our spacetime, past, present, and future. Wow!Now what about free will or agency? Christians believe that people can choose to do good or do evil and are therefore responsible for the consequences. On the other hand (from page 455), ""The laws of classical physics are deterministic. ...if you were to know precisely how things are now (the position and velocity of every particle in the universe), the laws of classical physics would tell you exactly how things were are would be at any other moment you specified. The equations are indifferent to the supposed freedom of human will."" So, according to classical physics, there is no such thing as agency or free will. But then along comes quantum theory and one view is (from page 456), ""...if the passage from probabilities to definite outcomes requires something beyond the standard quantum framework--it's at least possible that free will might find a concrete realization within physical law. We might one day find, as some physicists has speculated, that the act of conscious observation is an integral element of quantum mechanics, being the catalyst that coaxes one outcome from the quantum haze to be realized."" Greene goes on to say, ""Personally, I find this extremely unlikely, but I know of no way to rule it out."" He doesn't like it, but he has the honesty to admit that it's a possibility.Those who have faith that God exists don't, or shouldn't, need science to back Him up. But I've got to admit that it is nice when it does. Of course, as Greene points out, much of what physics proposes is theory that has not been experimentally verified. Some of the above may be supplanted in the future by other theories, but for the time being it is interesting that science seems to verify some of the attributes of God as understood by Christians."
112,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Once again, as in ""The Elegant Universe,"" Greene has done an exemplary job of presenting a ""popular"" explication of deep science (particle physics and cosmology) that is neither condescending nor watered down. I've been amazed both times than anyone could pull this off, since it's been attempted so often but left the subjects either impenetrable or eviscerated.Greene's salient attribute is clarity: He can find and present the basic contours of just about any scientific discipline in clear, disciplined, open outline. He employs several simple, elementary approaches to make this happen.• short, direct, declarative sentences: Beautiful writing with little waste.• analogy: His use of analogy to elucidate arcane concepts is spot on even when (especially when) the comparison seems initially off the wall. I can't, in any way, overestimate the worth of this ability. (Bertrand Russell made a hash of explaining relativity with a raft of confounding, muddying analogies.)• repetition: Greene presents an idea and its details from several different but complementary directions that both reinforce the underlying principles and keep them continually in mind. And he doesn't assume that once he's outlined a concept, you will automatically recall its ramifications three days later. Instead, when he refers to it again, he summarizes it quickly, as if reminding a friend walking with him down a forest path. • basic fairness: Greene has his biases (mostly in favor of string theory and its near relatives), which he never denies. But he gives full credit to the other theorists down the block, admits the failings of the theories he loves and the positive side of the others.• combining inside-outside views: Any enterprise can create a corporate worldview where what you're doing assumes a centrality that the rest of humanity might consider either scary or amusing. Greene is an insider, to different degrees, in the enterprises of mathematics, physics and string theory. Yet he does a pretty complete job of balancing the committed insider against the (more) objective outsider. He speaks equally well for himself, for the wider theoretical community, and to you, looking through the window. Greene's writing and willingness to share himself have grown since ""The Elegant Universe."" It shows most in his humor. He kept it under tight rein in the first work, but here it wanders out to laugh in the sun. ""The Simpsons"" in all their glory rollick throughout the book without apology, and the analogies often have a giggle in them that in no way limits their affect.Some of the elements I'd regretted being missed from ""The Elegant Universe"" are here in detail, in part because of the intervening half decade between publication, but I think more because that's what he's chosen here to add on. You've got dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs field (prior to the way-too-recent discovery of the Higgs boson), inflationary cosmology.I'm looking forward to reading his still more recent work."
113,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"Did Greene plagiarise a section of his book? More on that later.Oh, god, I'm surprised I finished it. For the most part, I enjoy theoretical physics. I'm not sure if I believe everything that theoretical physics proposes (but then again, I'm not one for blindly allowing myself to be pulled along by an entity I can't see), but I enjoy it nonetheless. And I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. Greene offers some thought provoking ideas, and he even mentions at one point the author of one of my favourite theoretical physics books,Lisa Randall. Unfortunately, Greene is unable to translate all his ideas into legible text. I was able to understand some of what he was saying, but after a while, my eyes started to glaze over and I was left puzzling my own existence. Greene tends to throw ideas out there (such as cracked eggs becoming whole again, or ice forming in a glass of warm water and then melting once more) without giving a warning, that leaves the reader wondering if perhaps Greene has lost his marbles in the search for truth. Furthermore, and this may be more a publisher's error, but the book promised discussion on black holes and the like- my favourite of all astronomical topics. However, black holes are only mentioned in depth in the last twenty odd pages. However, there was a chapter on time travel, wormholes and alternate universes, but that was only a short chapter in of itself.There was one segment I did catch that made me sit up and laugh. I only would have caught it because I read Flash Forward by Richard J. Sawyer shortly before this book. Greene and Sawyer both use the same analogy of Gone With the Wind as a way of describing looking through time, in exactly the same manner. Seeing as Sawyer wrote his novel first (back in 1999) and The Fabric of the Cosmos was written in 2004, I can only suspect that Greene was, er, inspired if you will to use it. Still, I'm sure Sawyer would appreciate the credit."
114,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Periodically I get inspired to read big science books aimed at clarifying things to laypeople without any maths. Generally, each time I get slightly further than I did the previous time before eventually losing focus and coasting to the end. This was one of those times. Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.Anyway. Some notes I took:The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!Maxwell/EinsteinMaxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.Quantum MechanicsLight tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.Part 2 - TimeTalks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.Quantum Mechanics + time.If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.CosmologyHubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of Back to the Future.Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. "
115,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"I wish I could say 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' is an easy read which makes clear a subject that only geniuses understand normally about what classic physics and quantum mechanics have to do with understanding the mysteries of cosmology, particularly the theories regarding what the universe is, how it began, what made it function the way it does and why there seems to be an arrow of Time. I can't. Physics is too hard for me. However, Brian Greene is a brilliant man with a teacher's magic talent of sussing out how to simplify and explain difficult complexities of scientific thought. His book 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' did not lose me until the final six chapters! Gentle reader, I highly recommend this book.Physics is not only about observations and experiments, it is mostly about interpreting horribly complicated maths. Fortunately, Brian Greene leaves the math for the 'Notes' section in the back of this book while describing through analogies and simple-as-possible, and logical, well-written historical vignettes about the key physics discoveries by famous physicists which illuminate the nature of space and time. Each step of increasing scientific knowledge important to cosmology is described in a logical procession of conclusions, facts and theories, chapter by chapter. I finally understood many much briefer and out-of-context explanations in science articles which I have occasionally read. (However, I think I will not remember much of this enlightenment in a few weeks, alas.)The newest theories and guesses, described in chapters 12-16, about three-branes and brane splats, extra dimensions, string theory holograms, super-symmetry particle spinning, potential energy bowls, free will (yes, I said free will), five-string theories, two 'Big Bang' theories, and loop quantum gravity, by these genius scientists are the hardest of all to understand by this ordinary mortal, gentle reader, but perseverance with 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' DID make a small collapse of probabilities in the jittering mass of my excited brain particles so that this cat was radiant with more intelligence upon exiting the ebook. Unfortunately, though, I have a feeling this enlightenment is but a moon's dim reflective glow, gone as soon as the sun rises."
116,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is a nice overview of modern physics, including implications of relativity (specific and general), quantum mechanics and string theory, together with a discussion of the implications for cosmology. Some of the interesting items discussed here include the notion that during the ""Planck time"", ie, 10^(-34) sec or so after the Big Bang, space and time had no meaning, that our 3-D universe may be only an illusion of an underlying 11-dimensional universe, and reality may be coded in a cosmic ""hologram"", and that our universe may be only a minor dot in an incomparably vaster ""multiverse"".My own objection to this book is that most of this material has been written elsewhere -- for starters, Greene's earlier book ""The Elegant Universe"" was an excellent introduction to string theory and its implications. That's a problem with writing a great book -- it's hard to match the same level of excitement in the next book.The other criticism that one might raise is that string theory and the multiverse, in particular, remain highly controversial in the field. Indeed, some scientists (such as Lee Smolin) are saying out loud that string theory has been given too much rope for too long, and it is time to face the reality that it has not produced any crisp, testable hypotheses (nor is it likely to for a while). For the same reasons, many are opposed to the notion of the ""multiverse"", not just for technical reasons but also for philosophical reasons -- how can the hypothesis of an infinity of companion universes, whose existence can only be indirectly suggested, even in principle, qualify as empirical science?"
117,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel,5,"The book focused mainly on the concepts of space and time, and how they build the universe around us. Starting with the concept of space and how that's changed over the years, then time and how that's changed and now the concept of spacetime, and then the universe itself. A large part of the book was used trying to explain, ""time's arrow"" why things go forward but never backwards, why entropy is always greater in the future and never the past. It was all very interesting. At times I did get a bit lost, though not that often, but I feel now I have a much better understanding of a lot of modern physics concepts and ideas, for example I know understand Pbranes user name! I never really understood the big bang, that the universe was expanding, not that things were just getting flung further out into space. I think inflationary cosmology is neat. (even if it doesn't tie everything together). The chapter I enjoyed the most I think had to be looking at the teleportation and possibilities of time travel in the future. It was definitely more on the what if end of physics, but it was very interesting and I really enjoyed his explanations for why there would be no paradox. But it's definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in learning how the universe might work, and how in a lot of ways it does. It made a nice change for me to read a book about a subject I know so little about. While I cannot therefore give an expert opinion about it's accuracy, it was fascinating and I feel like I understand the world a lot more now."
118,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-ivan-vukovi,5,"This is as fine (or very near) as popular physics goes. Although the book is maybe a bit too simple at times, I really enjoyed how Greene is able to present some very difficult concepts by gradually building up ideas. Instead of jumping over here and over there, he leads the reader in a very precise (well, as precise as you can get without serious mathematics) and logical manner which seems to be satisfying both to the layman and to the expert. Excellent!"

120,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"I like to talk shit about science sometimes. Sometimes it's just to push people's buttons and other times it's because of the pop side of science is ridiculous (you know like the studies that get quoted on your web-browsers start-up page, which may even be contradicted a few days from now by some other article, or all those fucking pharmaceutical ad's on TV. Hey, thanks Pfizer for helping make me a drug addict!). I just made a slight at pop-science and that is hypocritical of me, it's really the only type of science I can understand and this book basically falls into that category, it's a watered down version of real science so humanities idiots like me can understand concepts that they would stare open mouthed at if they had to read the actual articles about. By the way, I loved this book! Starting with a seemingly simple problem (or I would think it's simple, but it took a few hundred years and Einstein to adequately understand it, apparently (not that I could figure it out) about why the water in a bucket pushes up against the side of the bucket when you spin the bucket around really fast, Brian Green creates a narrative (I'm using this in it's normal manner, not in the science as narrative way that I use it when I want to piss people off, this book is a history of science book in quite a few ways) that shows how this bucket filled with some water paved the way for Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Uncertainty, the Big Bang, String Theory, M-Theory, Branes and other concepts that helped move forward theoretical understandings of the whole universe. Oh, actually the underlying theme to the book is how do we understand the concepts of space and time, or spacetime, which is one of the problems of understanding why the water in the bucket does what it does when it is spun around. Oh, did I mention I loved this book? I feel awkward giving it five stars because I lack the critical acumen to know if Brian Green is really telling the whole story, or if there is a huge bias here because I'm an idiot when it comes to matters like this. I felt like he was being fair though but maybe I was just dazzled by any of the mathematics he would throw into footnotes that I wouldn't have the first idea on what to do with if someone handed me even the simplest one and asked me to solve it. About a hundred pages into the book I had the realization that I should have been more interested in math and science growing up. More exactly I had the realization that the way math and science were taught in the schools I attended did nothing to inspire me at all. I'm fairly certain that most people never use most of the information they learn in science classes. I've never had the need to know all the parts of a flower, but if I had been taught something about what went into discovering some of the biology of (x) or say about the real awesomeness of evolution I'd probably have perked up and gotten interested. Or maybe learned about the difficulties still facing scientists when dealing with the subatomic level, and the weirdness of quantum uncertainty and entanglement might have gotten me more interested and wanting to know more in a chemistry class than endlessly learning how to balance electrons between elements (or whatever that fruitless exercise was called). I know these details are really important to doing science, but without any reason to care about wanting to know about science this is all just monumental busy work. Shouldn't it be the job of schools to get kids to care and wanting to learn rather than forcing meaningless facts onto them? This rantish aside about the misguided importance (pedological approach?) of science education in American schools was just me being bitter. It's too late now, and I'm too dumb in too many areas of knowledge but I should have been a theoretical physicist. That is what I realized reading this book. I wish someone had told me about the weird shit these people try to figure out, explained who Parmenides was and the basic gist of his Poem was, and then told me I could work on these problems for the rest of my life if I started to pay attention in math class and gave a shit about my science classes, that there was cool stuff I'd get to later on. Parmenides is never mentioned in this book, but at almost every step through the book he kept popping into my mind. He's my reoccurring fascination. His idea of the everything just being One at first glance is so silly. I remember the first time reading Zeno's Paradoxes (he was Parmenides student) and thinking they were just silly games with words, obviously something moves faster than something else and can over come it. Obviously an arrow shot at a target eventually hits it. Duh! But sometime soon after my immediate annoyance at these kinds of meaningless games something clicked in me and I started to try to think through what Parmenides could mean by the whole universe being an unchanging, undivisible, timeless thing. A point, if you would. On one level Parmenides can be thought of as the logical foil to the pre-Socratic materialists, the voice that says your theory is nice but what about (x)? I don't buy into the idea that was Parmenides only goal though. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know exactly what Parmenides thought, because of thanks to those motherfucking Christians and Moslems (you know for their multiple burnings of the Library of Alexandria (and Christians for their wanton destruction of 'heretical' literature) we have only a scant few fragments left from Parmenides work, and most of it is second hand from the post-Socratic arch-materialist Aristotle (materialist meaning something sort of different in the Ancient Greek sense than one would think of a materialist today). Are you bored yet?Anyway, back to Parmenides, I don't buy the idea that his role was only as foil, or goad to the materialists to make their theories more logically consistent. Why? Because of Plato. Socrates is bested only twice in the dialogues. First as a young man by Parmenides of Elea (the guy I've been writing about) in Parmenides and second by the Eleatic Stranger in The Sophist and The Statesman (these two dialogues are like a part one and part two to each other). The appearance of the Eleatic Stranger is in the two dialogues that come at the end of Socrates life, before the series of dialogues that make up the trial and death of Socrates. In both instances Socrates is bested in his arguments by the philosophy coming from Elea. Why? Why is the only person who Plato allows to give Socrates a philosophical beat-down either Parmenides or a stand in for him? (Parmenides himself couldn't be in a chronologically later dialogue, since he was an old man when Socrates was a youth). Anyway, long story that doesn't mean too much to anyone probably, but to sum it up Parmenides has been an thought game for me for years now, and many of the ideas that I've had to reconcile what Parmenides means I find in this fucking book, there are people who are seriously considering some of the logical games I play in my head about cosmology, but they have math and ways of actually coming up with answers! I haven't done a good job at it, but to me this is so exciting. It's like all of the crazy shit that philosophers have thought up over the years can be actually studied and not just argued about using a mismash of concepts and logic, but possibly measured and articulated with math and shit! This book is like a validation to the stuff I think about when I'm not just wallowing in self-pity or being sad. Of course, I knew that a lot of this stuff existed before reading this book, but I had no idea what any of it really meant. I just took the words and applied common meanings to them. String Theory? Oh, everything is interconnected with vibrating strings. Actually, no. That's not what String Theory means. Multi-dimensions, you mean like people could be living in a dimension almost on top of me that I don't see because I don't have access to those dimensions, but one day maybe we could, right? No, actually even if the dimensions are big, the word big is being used on a microscopic scale, like the width of a piece of hair big, as opposed to small as in so small we have nothing that can see it. I realized that most of the ways books in the new age section use science terms to validate their ideas and how they claim to be drawing on cutting edge research is bullshit, that they are just picking terms out and using them in ways to sell books on hokum. I realized reading this book that I wish I wasn't so stupid and that I could at least understand this stuff at more than in a non-technical watered down way."
121,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"Did you know that Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect anagram of “A Second Herring Quits”? And is a near perfect anagram of “Surely someone’s taking the piss”? The second anagram relies, of course (and almost entirely), on a rather judicious application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – but I do think that one may be more illuminating of how I’m finding some of the quantum mechanical experiments described in this book. There is part of me that would like to believe that in the early part of the last century (I don’t remember the year, but surely on an April First) a group of European physicists got together and decided to come up with an idea so monumentally ridiculous that it would have them chuckling at the gullibility of we more mathematically challenged for years to come. Einstein was in on the joke at the start, but ended up thinking it had all gone on for far too long. Frynman introduced some slapstick into the equations (in a fine American tradition) – but, as always, it takes an Irishman (John Bell) to put the final touches on the comedy and to make it truly surreal. So, why isn’t anybody laughing?If you are not disturbed by the findings of Quantum Mechanics, well, you’re really not trying hard enough. This is quite some book so far.UpdateOkay, I’ve finished and I’ve had problems with this one. In fact, I have many problems with modern physics and believe that the only way I could really understand it more would be to go back and finish off a degree in this stuff. Since I’m unlikely to do that, I am going to have to accept that this stuff will have to remain a mystery to me. This guy really does try to make this stuff accessible, but I’ve a feeling that without the maths it just does not make any sense on any level.My problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that every time there is a problem in Physics we are having trouble solving we just make up something invisible to solve it. Universe not expanding fast enough? Stuff it full of dark matter. Expanding too fast? Bring back the Cosmological Constant. Can’t make gravity fit in with quantum theory? Postulate string theory. Having trouble with quantum theory? Why not create an infinite number of universes that can’t access each other. Having trouble explaining the vibrations of one dimensional strings? Vibrate them in 11 dimensional space.Bring back the Ether, I say. Physics never seems to do anything by half. Even cosmic inflation seems to have inflated the universe to a ridiculous extent in the first nanosecond of the universe.I don’t believe I can really say anything sensible about any of this stuff. It is so far divorced from my limited understanding that to express an opinion really just makes me feel incredibly ignorant. Like I said, I’m not prepared to learn the maths, so I should just shut up. It is a pity physics has become so esoteric – I would like to be one of its great defenders, to use it as a basis to understand the universe, but I come away from these books feeling someone is having me on.This is a good book, in part. Some of it is still remarkably hard going – even with the allusions to the Simpsons and X Files (I’ve never seen the X Files or some of the other bits of pop culture mentioned, so that made what I took to be some of the jokes quite inaccessible to me – but that will just be me). The stuff about Newton’s Bucket was utterly fascinating and well worth reading. The stuff of string theory was like most stuff on string theory – I’ve virtually no understanding of this stuff and can’t quite follow the controversy that surrounds it. Anyway, it sounds like no one will ever be able to test any of this stuff – if we can’t see an electron how the hell are we ever going to see a one dimensional string?My main problem with this book was his early explanation of entropy and how this did not provide an arrow of time. He says that if you watch a film of an egg falling and braking that you could reverse the film and there is nothing in the laws of physics to decide which direction the film travelled in that must be the right direction. He says that there would be a way to get all the bits of egg to fly back at the right speed and reconstitute. This, of course, is nonsense. It is not a matter of things coming back together at the right speed that is the issue. Have you ever broken a glass? You don’t get the pieces to go back together again by moving them together at the ‘right speed’. They never go back together again. This is a one way reaction. Why? Because once the glass is broken the bonds between the atoms in the glass are broken. Pushing the pieces together again is pushing negatively charged electrons against negatively charged electrons and they will repeal each other, not just nicely bond. There are laws of physics and laws of chemistry that do not allow this reversal. I figure that if I have spotted a flaw in this easy bit of his argument there are too many bits of this argument that I struggled to follow that may be just as equally flawed. (This stuff is from about page 145 – 169)I did learn some interesting stuff from this book – even about entropy. I had no idea that the arrow of entropy was double headed or that inflation was the main cause of order in the young universe. But large parts of this book deal with questions that are simply too esoteric. I ended up knowing that I would never know what was in a black hole or what caused the big bang and basically not really caring. I’m sure this wasn’t Greene’s intention, more is the pity."
122,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Wow, what a wonderful book. What a ride it was. Brian is definitely one of the best science popularisers about, hands down. It is amazing how he manages to convey potentially complex subjects, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, in a simple but at the same time rigorous manner. And he does that with a contagious enthusiasm which reminded to me why I love physics. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he never gets into the game (like so frequently happens in popular science books, unfortunately) of oversimplifying the subject. His book is very readable and he has a great gift of explaining complex subjects with an amazing clarity. While the book may be a bit too simple at times, more quantitative detail is available in the notes at the end of the book (which I strongly recommend you read, to get more detail), and bibliographic references are pretty good. It is a fantastic introductory book to the realm of contemporary physics - of course, if you are interested in more quantitative treatments of such subjects, then this is probably not the book for you - although I must say that everybody with an interest in science should really take the time to read this masterpiece. The author, being a foremost scientist directly involved in the most advanced research efforts in areas such as String Theory, does have his own preferences and biases (all honestly acknowledged by him, and also they do not impact the overall objectivity and impartiality of his book). Moreover, being particle physics an area of such intense and frantic development, there are a couple of area where the book looks a bit dated (for example, even if SUSY is not officially dead, the results coming out of the LHC are such that there is increasing doubt over the real prospects of SUSY and consequently of Super String Theories - although it is completely premature to claim that they are dead).Overall, it is an amazing introductory book, informative, entertaining, lucid, and a complete pleasure to read.

This feeling, this sensation that time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments—previous frames—to be ""sequentially illuminated.""﻿In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian GreeneI agree that this is at least as much philosophy as science, though mathematically based philosophy. But what irks me is that for all the pages of science books devoted to this subject, no one has pointed out that for us to experience moments sequentially (assuming those moments don't themselves move) our mind has to move through those moments. And movement entails time. So while time may be a spatial dimension, if Greene (and Godel, etc.) are right, then there must be at least one other dimension of time that allows our minds to move through the different moments that all exist and experience them sequentially.﻿"
124,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Let's start with the positives: Greene does an excellent job of explaining very hard-to-understand concepts in non-mathematical ways. That said, I think it was unecessary to use popular culture the way he did. It feels silly, reading about Einstein and general relativity and getting an example which uses the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart, and Lisa and so forth. But okay, I admit that this is a fairly small detail that shouldn't take too much away from the overall experience. The important thing is that the concepts are explained in a manner which is understandable. Does Greene do that? He does, for the most part.Furthermore, Greene is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and that is something that is contagious. Reading about the bucket argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_a...) and the various attempts at answering it; the exciting exploration of time, the arrow of time, and its mysteries; the exhilarating explanation of entropy; the outline of general relativity, quantum mechanics and a whole host of other physical theories, and on the whole Greene's passionate way of writing makes this an extremely engaging read. And the subject matter is interesting. I mean, the bending of space and time, particles being ""entangled"" (""spooky action at a distance"") through space, possible hidden dimensions, elusive particles, multiverses.. Paul Erdos said that ""if numbers aren't beautiful, I don't know what is."" Well, if this stuff isn't interesting, I don't know what is! Thus, overall, the book is extremely engaging and exciting, and it's one of those books that are very much, in many ways, unputdownable. Now, the negatives.First of all, the illustrations are almost no help, because they are of awful quality. I read the hardcover version, and even here they are small, with no colour and in fairly awful quality. Another problem with the book has been pointed out in this review as well, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... You get the impression that without the math, a lot of this just isn't really possible to convey properly. You are left with only a part of the picture. I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's words: ""To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."" Sometimes Greene is pretty frank about this. He'll essentially write, ""okay, I know this is far-fetched, but trust me on this one: the math is right, guys."" To Greene's credit, there are a lot of pages in the back of the book devoted to the more mathematically inclined reader, so that those who do get it can check it out for themselves. Now, the last negative aspect of the book is the fact that there's not a whole lot of new things here. If you've read The Elegant Universe, you don't really get a whole lot of new knowledge, except that this book is less about string theory and more about cosmology. I think it's enough to read one of them, which kind of renders this book somewhat unecessary. With all those negatives aside, the book is enjoyable and engaging. If you want some stretching exercises for your imagination, it's not a mistake to pick it up."
125,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856764-kristen,0,"I GIVE UPYou win this round science book **(shakes fist in anger)**In fact, after reading this book I've given up on science completely in favor the Nabokovian theory of very young earth creationism: The World Was Created This Morning. ""Theoretically there is no absolute proof that one's awakening in the morning (the finding oneself again in the saddle of one's personality) is not really a quite unprecedented event, a perfectly original birth."" Yeah, that does make a bit more sense than most of this book. . . . I'm starting to wish I never listed this here because if I hadn't I could give up without feeling so bad (or anyone knowing). It's not that he's a bad writer it's just that I'm not that smart, but I suppose we all have own unique talents, right? Sure, Brian Greene might understand physics but can he roll a joint while driving his car with his knee? . . . so yeah, I got that going for me at-least . . . That's something, right?"
126,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"You probably know more about physics than you think. See, right there, when your brain registered the p-word, a black hole of anxiety opened up in the pit of your stomach from which nothing can escape. Your underarms began to radiate heat as your mind conjured memories of stuffy high school laboratories. And as your eyes scanned ahead for those dreaded half-English, half-Greek words followed by an equal sign, the probability of you reading on fast approached zero.But there’s hope! Whether you realize it or not, you just visualized some of the more important natural phenomena that govern the world around us. The stomachache was space-time curvature at a point of infinite density. The sweating was a crass simulation of something known as black body radiation. And your waning interest was a metaphor for quantum non-locality. What do these words mean? It doesn’t really matter. Even complicated physical processes were surmountable — even understandable — when they were put into the context of something familiar, say, traumatic experiences of young adulthood.Without analogy and metaphor, a reader can quickly suffocate in the rarified air of the hard sciences. The task then for any science writer is to couch these concepts in colloquial terms and familiar experiences, and no one does it better than Brian Greene. His second of two books, The Fabric of the Cosmos, is a potent distillation of 200 years of discovery and an invaluable roadmap of reality that is almost impossible to get lost with, regardless of your level of scientific knowledge. It is a compelling narrative of the search for understanding that probes the boundaries of human experience. Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, is not the first to attempt such a crash course in physics history and experiment for the non-science minded, and he won’t be the last. In fact, the popularity of this breed of book has even necessitated its own genre, which has come to be known as pop-physics. Make no mistake; it is truly a difficult task to make the revolutionary ideas of hundreds of brilliant people not only digestible, but palatable in fewer than 500 pages. Since you can’t change the elements of the story — an exhaustive historical record of dozens of collaborating countries — good science writing then becomes an exercise in conversational skills, patient instruction and plenty of examples.Greene is adept at all three but his skillful employment of examples is one of the book’s greatest strengths. Throughout the text, he uses objects we experience and protagonists we can visualize to illustrate his points. The Simpsons characters, Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, and former President Bill Clinton all appear on multiple occasions and eggs, snowflakes and bowling balls all serve as props. As juvenile as this might seem, you would be surprised at how effective Greene’s methods are. At one point in the book, he tries to explain how something called the Higgs ocean — typically the focus of a Ph.D. thesis — may give particles like protons and electrons their mass. But he uses a very familiar and somewhat playful example to illustrate the point. “If [a particle] has greater difficulty accelerating through the Higgs ocean, it has a greater mass. If we liken a particle’s mass to a person’s fame, then the Higgs ocean is like the paparazzi: those who are unknown pass through the swarming photographers with ease, but famous politicians and movie stars have to push much harder to reach their destination.”While this technique of using vivid examples seems straight forward, it is actually very easy to mess up and there are a few cardinal sins that many physics authors commit. A common transgression is to sacrifice accuracy for sensationalism under the misconception that science fiction is the only way to engage the average reader. The very talented Michio Kaku of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (the same place Einstein spent the last few decades of his life) is a repeat offender. His most recent work of pop-physics, called Hyperspace, contains examples that are shamelessly unscientific at times and really underestimate the reader’s intelligence.But by no means does Greene dumb down the information in Fabric and yet, none of the underlying ideas are lost. Further, he doesn’t resort to sensationalized hypothetical situations but instead finds a creative way to make the reader appreciate real scientific results. In doing so, he makes it more than understandable. He makes the reader appreciate and even enjoy the excitement of discovery.And if Greene’s delivery of concepts is superb, his thoughtful selection of content only reinforces the readability of the text. The fundamental — and most impressive — difference between Greene and most other science writers is the breadth of the issues he addresses. Another cardinal sin for a science writer is to allow a topic’s complexity to dictate its relevance, which is just a cop out and a disservice to the reader. Gary Zukov, the author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, basically left out entire chapters of vital experimental findings because they were too tough to couch in human experience. But Greene doesn’t succumb to such temptations of writing around difficult material. He acknowledges the complexity of problematic topics and painstakingly walks the reader through the material every time.Unfortunately, some concepts will be beyond analogy and word craft and require at least a cursory digression of technicalities. As Greene puts it: “Human language is far better at capturing human experience than at expressing deep physical laws.” But what is unique about Fabric is that Greene gives the reader the option to get more technical without a loss of continuity. Throughout the text, he would broach a huge topic by putting it into historical context and discussing its relevance in the big physics picture. Often, the section would end with an ultimatum: keep reading to explore the details for a deeper understanding or skip to the next chapter with at least these implications in mind. This “choose your own adventure” organization gives the book a refreshing flexibility that is too often absent from pop-physics novels.Writing style also plays a large role in this work’s success. Richard Feynman, one of the more beloved albeit quirky physicists of the 20th century, was famous for his conversational style physics lessons. Though this made Feynman an incredibly effective educator, he was never able to write a book for want of literary chops. Fabric is such a good read because Greene buttresses the same savvy teaching techniques with an eloquent style of storytelling. Some parts are downright poetic and they uncover the easily missed romance and excitement of scientific discovery. He writes, “By deepening our understanding of the true nature of physical reality, we profoundly reconfigure our sense of ourselves and our experience of the universe.” And other parts are surprisingly suspenseful, especially for a narrative with such well-publicized plot twists. Even though most people know that Albert Einstein would propose his groundbreaking theories of relativity in the early 1900s, until Greene gets to that part of the story, this reader was genuinely concerned about the troublesome relationship between absolute space and time. (Spoiler: It all works out beautifully!)One of the more striking features of The Fabric of the Cosmos is how Greene’s enthusiasm for modern physics almost leaps off the page, making the reader wonder, if only for a second, whether or not the Large Hadron Collider will actually produce spontaneous symmetry breaking of massive scalar bosons. But that’s beside the point. To wonder about the world around us is the first step on the path to scientific discovery and Greene’s work makes it so that anyone can find the way."

Get me into anything more than general commentary, discoveries, famous names and famous theories, and I'm completely at a loss. Green is a likable and passionate author, but for readers without a physics knowledge base, his little treatise is tough going, even with all the Simpsons references. I remember the most important concepts, but the intricacies didn't stick with me. This book is best read in segments, preferably when you're completely lucid and can take notes. "

Sacks, Sagan, Ramachandran, Richard Simmons, etc. I had never heard of Brian Greene and have typically held physics and such things at arm's length, with my other hand pinching my nose shut as if holding the world's most curious diaper: there is probably much of interest within to parse out, but noxious enough to keep me anyway. This book was recommended to me (okay, it was a present) by a friend who seems to be aware of my constant questioning of the nature of the very fabric of reality itself. Luckily, this book squares a lot of things and sets them to rights for me.Greene is an awesome writer. He's funny and he describes this complicated shizz really well (he likes to make Simpsons analogies). There are few parts that are mind-bending to the point where I got a headache. Greene will outright warn you to skip ahead if its getting too dense, which is nice.As to the actual content? Fuck, it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I'll just say, I came out of the book feeling and sounding smarter. I can rap about three-branes, the Many Worlds hypothesis and impress my friends with my knowledge of the eleven spacetime dimensions.All-in-all, satisfying, funny, and informative."

This book was not the answer to my acquisition of knowledge. In fact, I learned almost nothing from this book. The writing is awful. It seeks to explain through dense prose, repetitive text, asinine pop references and endless in text questions. It really just shows why science writers should write books for the general public, not most scientists. Further, the author is in love with his superstring research and theory, but never convinced me it actually exists. All in all, it’s hard for me to express my disgust with this book. At least my nightmare and dread of reading on with this book have come to an end. I will never read this author again and may just avoid cosmos and superstring science if there’s no better work out there. "
130,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Glancing at the reviews for Brian Greene's overview of how we view the stuff of which our universe is made, it seems that some people base their rating and opinion on how much they agree with the science, or how credible they find it. While I have read a fair few popular science books – especially in the areas of physics and cosmology, areas I find utterly fascinating and about which I am perplexed that anyone can not be astounded and beguiled – I have to assume that I am reading a fair explanation of facts and theories. That is not to say that I assume the author is more knowledgeable than me simply because he has more letters after his name, but because he grounds his claims with background and the weight of evidence that is needed for a scientific hypothesis to become a generally accepted theory. Also, I have taken the effort to educate myself in these areas so have enough grounding myself to be able to appreciate the arguments.That said, for much of this book I'm unsure how much background would be needed to understand the explanations. Greene writes with a clarity and readability which is all too rare in any field, and is particularly welcome in discussing such big ideas. As in Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, Greene completely dispenses with calculations but, unlike Hawking, he also tries to keep the use of metaphor to a minimum. It cannot, of course, be dispensed with completely – metaphors are an extraordinarily powerful descriptive tool, especially in a field that can only properly be explained and understood using specialist mathematics – but for the most part Greene simply gives an overview of each field in historical context, and explains WHY it is important, what it explains and why it works.He starts – as modern physics in so many fields must – with Isaac Newton, and particularly Newton's Bucket. If you hang a bucket of water on a rope and twist the rope, as the rope unwinds, spinning the bucket, at first the water remains stationary until the friction of the bucket's movement makes the water begin to spin. When it does, the surface becomes increasingly concave, moved outward by what why now call centripetal (or centrifugal) force. But what, asked Newton, is the water moving away from, or toward? What is it moving in relation to? He decided that it moved in relation to the fixed fabric of the cosmos, the stuff in which the matter (that he recognised as being the thing on which gravity works) sits. Recognising that he had no way of testing this medium by experiment, Newton took this is an immutable absolute and left it at that. Greene keeps returning to the bucket and its implications throughout the book, to superb explanatory effect.I won't go further into the details (read the book!), but simply say that thanks to Professor Greene I now understand areas of cosmology and physics where I had previously had to simply give in to brain cramp and accept as being true. I understand why the speed of light (actually, the speed of any electromagnetic radiation) is approx 300, 000 km/sec faster than you, no matter how fast you are travelling. I understand a whole lot more about General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and why they make sense and are such powerful tools in describing our universe. I understand that Inflationary Theory is not merely a tweak of Big Bang theory to enable it to fit observed facts, but a whole new way of looking at the growth of the universe that actually explains much more about the fundamental physics.I'm not claiming a thorough understanding of these subjects (and in some, like Brane Theory, I still found myself rather lost; a re-read may be in order), but I feel that The Fabric of the Cosmos has deepened my comprehension of and appreciation for the wonders of our universe. And for the wonders of the human mind to work out these things. In around three hundred years we have developed this system, science, as a means of examining the world around us in a way which is comprehensible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. All books on science now seem to feel the need to restate this about science; it is NOT knowledge passed down from on high by men in white coats using deliberately obfuscatory language for reasons of either professional pride or conspiracy. Science is a method that enables us to understand more and more about the world, to revel in the joy of knowing how the rainbow is formed as well as in its simple beauty. No idea in science is sacrosanct, no theory is holy. To achieve the status of acceptance of say, General Relativity or Evolution by Natural Selection, a theory has to be tested – that is, it has to survive again and again and again the onslaught of people systematically trying to prove it wrong. When a weakness is found the theory must be re-examined. Sometimes the fault will cause the foundations of the theory to crumble, and it will be discarded; it has still served a purpose, to show how promising such an approach is. Sometimes finding the errors will strengthen a theory and teach us more – Edwin Hubble's original calculations of distant galaxies seemed to show the universe to be about 1.5 billion years old, despite lots of other evidence at the time insisting it was at least 3 billion years old (as we now know, this was still almost five times too conservative). Everything else about Hubble's observation and theory made sense, there was simply an error in calculating the distance of the super novae he was using to get the figures, a correction which itself taught us much about the universe.And this is incredibly important to realise because, while many theories, however much work they take, partly make sense on an intuitive level you get to Quantum and Brane theory and they simply cannot – in fact they seem, by intuition and everyday experience, utterly ridiculous (the great physicist Nils Bor said something along the lines of “if you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory”) but they are undoubtedly right. One important way a theory is tested is to use it to make predictions in the physical world and Quantum Theory has been called far and away the most successful predictive theory in science. It is, like every successful theory, one that accurately describes the way our universe works, with the limits of perception and understanding we have, which is why theories are modified or discarded when new information comes along. Which is why General Relativity replaced Newton's Laws of Gravitation as the best description we have for how gravity works – although NASA still use Newton's calculations most of the time, for the same reason you don't need to understand Gaussian Quadratic Maths to balance your chequebook.Greene's book, the first I've read by him, shows why it is worth reading a range of books on the same (or closely connected) areas of science. While in The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinov managed to convey a sense of wonder and discovery on a par with Carl Sagan's writings (a plaudit I don't throw around lightly!), Greene has given us a book that manages a clarity and depth of explanation while being a thoroughly entertaining read. At schools, perhaps instead of training our children into narrowly defined roles, science classes should just be introducing them to the works of Greene and Hawking, Sagan and Tyson (Neil deGrasse, not Mike) and Krauss to show them how huge and wonderful and beautiful the universe is, and how much joy and fulfilment can be achieved through our efforts to understand it."
131,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,5,"What an incredible journey this was. I think Brian is fantastically gifted to explain esoteric and cutting-edge cosmological concepts without the use of formulae and maths. He says himself that he will only use metaphors to explain the ideas, but even so he remains respectful of his subject, he does not dumb things down, and I found the metaphors for the most part evocative and helpful. Towards the end of the book, however, the ideas get so far removed from human intuition that I would have wanted a little more formalism, perhaps. But - this was on offer as well! Brian adds a copious body of footnotes and in this way relegates a more rigorous discussion to the back of the book. This discussion will of course still not satisfy those who have an in-depth understanding of the science involved, but I don't think they are the target group of this book in the first place. To me, this was the best account of the current state (well, it's ten years old, but close enough) of cosmology I have read. The field appears to be so fast-moving that some of his statements in the later chapters have already been overtaken by reality, but there is a special charm in hearing Brian suggest that the LIGO experiment may demonstrate the existence of gravitational waves in decades to come when you know that this has already happened, much sooner than he thought. Equally, I felt a pang of regret when he expresses optimism that the LHC runs may find evidence of extra spatial dimensions soon after the upgrade to higher energies, knowing this has not happened yet, and scepticism is mounting that it ever will.Transcending what Brian was actually teaching me about the science, I also had an epiphany when I was reading the book. Brian talks at length about the shortcomings of the Big Bang theory, and explains how the theory of inflation may answer some of its more frustrating issues, such as the flatness problem. The flatness problem highlights the issue that a tiny difference in origin conditions would have generated a universe entirely different from the one we observe today. Now, I have always thought that this is no mystery, the fact that we are here to observe this universe is the reason we may puzzle about these finetuned conditions, but they are just one in many, equally possible, universes, and our surprise is therefore of our own making. I even thought this position was enlightened, and quite clever. But Brian explained that physicists abhor theories that rely on unknown qualities, on axiomatic pronouncements that accept something as a given. I understood that only by asking ""why"" were physicists able to develop a theory that explains the finetuning, and go beyond the Big Bang as the creation theory of the universe. And this was an excellent lesson to me. I think I knew this once, but I had forgotten about it. In my case, my anthropic stance was actually an attempt on my part to avoid a deeper question, an attempt to posit an answer where there wasn't one yet. Brian reminded me that we must never stop asking ""why"", that asking ""why"" is what makes us human. I loved this book. I can only recommend it to anybody who does not have a formal degree in science and wants to learn more about cosmology but is a bit frustrated about the lack of depth popular accounts of this topic typically provide."

Greene avoids both. This is hands down the best popular intro to modern physics I've found. Even with half a B.S. in physics and formal courses on many of the topics covered, this book consistently kept my interest and taught me new things.Two unique aspects of this book I haven't found elsewhere are (1) its focus on space and time and (2) its enthusiasm. As for (1), most pop sci books on physics focus on trying to convey one or more specific theories (quantum theory, special relativity, string theory, etc) and may discuss space or time in the context of one of these theories but don't make connections between them. Greene actually makes space and time the main character of this story and follows them throughout history and across theories. As for (2), not since Richard Feynman have I found a physicist whose writing makes me shiver with childish delight at the wonders of the universe. Some might find his poetic geeky gushes cheesy, but others (like myself) will spend the next several evenings lying outside on their lawns, staring at the stars, and just basking in the awesomeness of it all.That said, don't expect a book without mathematics to convey a full picture of our current understanding of physics. Nature seems to be written most naturally in the language of mathematics and that is the language in which she must be read. Hopefully though, if you haven't gotten over a particularly frightening encounter with mathematics as a young impressionable child, this book will convince you that it's worth doing.If you:

   are interested in modern physics but don't know where to start 
   have read a few pop sci books or many pop sci articles but want to see how many of the ideas fit together 
   or curious about our past and current understanding of space and time

134,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This was as very confounding book to me - not confusing but confounding. It has some amazing observations and conundrums to ponder over and I suspect I did not appreciate (or even understand all that it had to tell me).Let me explain - some of the chapters used examples - some of which I have actually studied in my years in education. For example the example where electrons can be treated as particles while at the same time be treated as waves. Now I remember the experiments and I remember the theory that went with them. But I did not associated them with the bigger picture being presented in the chapter. And so the reason why I am confounded- this book challenges many of the scientific notions, a few it takes and builds upon them often reinforcing the notions it is trying to convey. And yet reading this book I feel there is so much more to learn and understand (including some of the sections in the book itself). Ironically looking back at my education I realise that rather than trying to build a foundation for me to build upon I feel like it have been shown how little I know and how so much there is still to explore and learn.Books like this have a variety of effects on me - but this is the first to make me feel so small in the scheme of things. But rather than making it feel a negative experience its almost like a reassurance that you are part of everything and in the right place. As I have said earlier there is more to be learnt from this book - but for now I need let my mind rest as its had a bit of a work out reading these pages. "

We’re storytellers, and what could be more grand than the story of creation?” Admittedly, my head was spinning quite a bit during this read. After all, trying to understand quantum physics is something my brain just isn't wired to do.I love science, and even though volumes like this can be a task to get through, I am always left enlightened and amazed at the facts and philosophies of existence and all that it encompasses. This is not a book I would recommend if you are only wanting to be entertained, but I will say this; several times during this read I snapped out a stupor and realized I had been staring off into space, lost in those thoughts of time, space, and reality.

My only criticism is that Greene can't figure out who his audience is: there's an odd mix of esoterica and the mundane. Most of the esoteric stuff is banished to the footnotes, which are well worth reading--and I suppose I should be happy that it's there at all, since most books on modern science are written with Hawking's Editor's Law in mind: with each equation, your audience shrinks by 90%.

I guess at least now I am familiar enough with the concepts which confuse me to be able to sound like I know something about general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory over beers with friends, and that's the important thing, right?Greene uses lots of pop cultural referenced examples to illustrate difficult mathematic/theoretical constructs, so familiarity with the Simpsons, X-Files, Star Trek and Star Wars may sometimes have you thinking ""hey, I know what he's talking about"" even when you have no clue. I think some of it actually did sink in, so I'm going to recommend this to anyone who desires a primer on the advances in physics & cosmology since e=mc2 but doesn't want to read a bunch of equations."

I really enjoyed the many easy to understand explanations. Also, the book has a lot of material for the reader that even has an intermediate understanding of theoretical physics. So, it's great for a broader range of science buffs.The book covers many of the relevant theoretic physics theories. The books gives a great chronological history of physics itself.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Tkanje Svemira autora Brajana Grina / Heliks 2016 publishing / 592 pages / 159,214 words.Translation was well done."

After reading this book, you'll always have unfinished business in discovering more and more about the universe. This book is a very good intro to physics and discovering about the universe."
141,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951046-john,4,"Lots of really interesting things in this book. I didn't realize physics had progressed so far in finding a unification theory.What I found most interesting would probably horrify the author because, while he didn't say so in so many words, he apparently really believes that physics is, or can be, the answer to everything. I, on the other hand, believe there is a God, the Christian God, who has a hand in our existence.I have always thought it curious that descriptions of God or angels appearing to people seem to be accompanied by bright light and that the supernatural being just appears out of nowhere. Upon reflection this seemed to me very much like them coming out of another dimension. So, what to my surprise, some of the current notions coming out of physics is that reality consists of more dimensions than we currently are able to experience. Score one for angels appearing out of nowhere because they can move from another dimension into our 3-dimensional existence.Then there's the issue of God being omniscient, i.e. knowing everything, past, present, and future. OK, He's God, so I suppose he can know all that, but it seems kind of difficult to figure how He can know the future when it hasn't happened yet. So, what to my surprise again, I learn that physics suggests that space and time are not independent but should be considered spacetime. And (from page 452) ""that moments--the events making up the spacetime loaf--just are. They are timeless. Each moment--each event or happening--exists, just as each point in space exists."" So it appears that someone, God, for instance, who has extent in another dimension outside our spacetime, could presumably see all of our spacetime, past, present, and future. Wow!Now what about free will or agency? Christians believe that people can choose to do good or do evil and are therefore responsible for the consequences. On the other hand (from page 455), ""The laws of classical physics are deterministic. ...if you were to know precisely how things are now (the position and velocity of every particle in the universe), the laws of classical physics would tell you exactly how things were are would be at any other moment you specified. The equations are indifferent to the supposed freedom of human will."" So, according to classical physics, there is no such thing as agency or free will. But then along comes quantum theory and one view is (from page 456), ""...if the passage from probabilities to definite outcomes requires something beyond the standard quantum framework--it's at least possible that free will might find a concrete realization within physical law. We might one day find, as some physicists has speculated, that the act of conscious observation is an integral element of quantum mechanics, being the catalyst that coaxes one outcome from the quantum haze to be realized."" Greene goes on to say, ""Personally, I find this extremely unlikely, but I know of no way to rule it out."" He doesn't like it, but he has the honesty to admit that it's a possibility.Those who have faith that God exists don't, or shouldn't, need science to back Him up. But I've got to admit that it is nice when it does. Of course, as Greene points out, much of what physics proposes is theory that has not been experimentally verified. Some of the above may be supplanted in the future by other theories, but for the time being it is interesting that science seems to verify some of the attributes of God as understood by Christians."
142,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Once again, as in ""The Elegant Universe,"" Greene has done an exemplary job of presenting a ""popular"" explication of deep science (particle physics and cosmology) that is neither condescending nor watered down. I've been amazed both times than anyone could pull this off, since it's been attempted so often but left the subjects either impenetrable or eviscerated.Greene's salient attribute is clarity: He can find and present the basic contours of just about any scientific discipline in clear, disciplined, open outline. He employs several simple, elementary approaches to make this happen.• short, direct, declarative sentences: Beautiful writing with little waste.• analogy: His use of analogy to elucidate arcane concepts is spot on even when (especially when) the comparison seems initially off the wall. I can't, in any way, overestimate the worth of this ability. (Bertrand Russell made a hash of explaining relativity with a raft of confounding, muddying analogies.)• repetition: Greene presents an idea and its details from several different but complementary directions that both reinforce the underlying principles and keep them continually in mind. And he doesn't assume that once he's outlined a concept, you will automatically recall its ramifications three days later. Instead, when he refers to it again, he summarizes it quickly, as if reminding a friend walking with him down a forest path. • basic fairness: Greene has his biases (mostly in favor of string theory and its near relatives), which he never denies. But he gives full credit to the other theorists down the block, admits the failings of the theories he loves and the positive side of the others.• combining inside-outside views: Any enterprise can create a corporate worldview where what you're doing assumes a centrality that the rest of humanity might consider either scary or amusing. Greene is an insider, to different degrees, in the enterprises of mathematics, physics and string theory. Yet he does a pretty complete job of balancing the committed insider against the (more) objective outsider. He speaks equally well for himself, for the wider theoretical community, and to you, looking through the window. Greene's writing and willingness to share himself have grown since ""The Elegant Universe."" It shows most in his humor. He kept it under tight rein in the first work, but here it wanders out to laugh in the sun. ""The Simpsons"" in all their glory rollick throughout the book without apology, and the analogies often have a giggle in them that in no way limits their affect.Some of the elements I'd regretted being missed from ""The Elegant Universe"" are here in detail, in part because of the intervening half decade between publication, but I think more because that's what he's chosen here to add on. You've got dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs field (prior to the way-too-recent discovery of the Higgs boson), inflationary cosmology.I'm looking forward to reading his still more recent work."
143,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"Did Greene plagiarise a section of his book? More on that later.Oh, god, I'm surprised I finished it. For the most part, I enjoy theoretical physics. I'm not sure if I believe everything that theoretical physics proposes (but then again, I'm not one for blindly allowing myself to be pulled along by an entity I can't see), but I enjoy it nonetheless. And I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. Greene offers some thought provoking ideas, and he even mentions at one point the author of one of my favourite theoretical physics books,Lisa Randall. Unfortunately, Greene is unable to translate all his ideas into legible text. I was able to understand some of what he was saying, but after a while, my eyes started to glaze over and I was left puzzling my own existence. Greene tends to throw ideas out there (such as cracked eggs becoming whole again, or ice forming in a glass of warm water and then melting once more) without giving a warning, that leaves the reader wondering if perhaps Greene has lost his marbles in the search for truth. Furthermore, and this may be more a publisher's error, but the book promised discussion on black holes and the like- my favourite of all astronomical topics. However, black holes are only mentioned in depth in the last twenty odd pages. However, there was a chapter on time travel, wormholes and alternate universes, but that was only a short chapter in of itself.There was one segment I did catch that made me sit up and laugh. I only would have caught it because I read Flash Forward by Richard J. Sawyer shortly before this book. Greene and Sawyer both use the same analogy of Gone With the Wind as a way of describing looking through time, in exactly the same manner. Seeing as Sawyer wrote his novel first (back in 1999) and The Fabric of the Cosmos was written in 2004, I can only suspect that Greene was, er, inspired if you will to use it. Still, I'm sure Sawyer would appreciate the credit."
144,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Periodically I get inspired to read big science books aimed at clarifying things to laypeople without any maths. Generally, each time I get slightly further than I did the previous time before eventually losing focus and coasting to the end. This was one of those times. Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.Anyway. Some notes I took:The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!Maxwell/EinsteinMaxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.Quantum MechanicsLight tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.Part 2 - TimeTalks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.Quantum Mechanics + time.If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.CosmologyHubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of Back to the Future.Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. "
145,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"I wish I could say 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' is an easy read which makes clear a subject that only geniuses understand normally about what classic physics and quantum mechanics have to do with understanding the mysteries of cosmology, particularly the theories regarding what the universe is, how it began, what made it function the way it does and why there seems to be an arrow of Time. I can't. Physics is too hard for me. However, Brian Greene is a brilliant man with a teacher's magic talent of sussing out how to simplify and explain difficult complexities of scientific thought. His book 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' did not lose me until the final six chapters! Gentle reader, I highly recommend this book.Physics is not only about observations and experiments, it is mostly about interpreting horribly complicated maths. Fortunately, Brian Greene leaves the math for the 'Notes' section in the back of this book while describing through analogies and simple-as-possible, and logical, well-written historical vignettes about the key physics discoveries by famous physicists which illuminate the nature of space and time. Each step of increasing scientific knowledge important to cosmology is described in a logical procession of conclusions, facts and theories, chapter by chapter. I finally understood many much briefer and out-of-context explanations in science articles which I have occasionally read. (However, I think I will not remember much of this enlightenment in a few weeks, alas.)The newest theories and guesses, described in chapters 12-16, about three-branes and brane splats, extra dimensions, string theory holograms, super-symmetry particle spinning, potential energy bowls, free will (yes, I said free will), five-string theories, two 'Big Bang' theories, and loop quantum gravity, by these genius scientists are the hardest of all to understand by this ordinary mortal, gentle reader, but perseverance with 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' DID make a small collapse of probabilities in the jittering mass of my excited brain particles so that this cat was radiant with more intelligence upon exiting the ebook. Unfortunately, though, I have a feeling this enlightenment is but a moon's dim reflective glow, gone as soon as the sun rises."
146,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is a nice overview of modern physics, including implications of relativity (specific and general), quantum mechanics and string theory, together with a discussion of the implications for cosmology. Some of the interesting items discussed here include the notion that during the ""Planck time"", ie, 10^(-34) sec or so after the Big Bang, space and time had no meaning, that our 3-D universe may be only an illusion of an underlying 11-dimensional universe, and reality may be coded in a cosmic ""hologram"", and that our universe may be only a minor dot in an incomparably vaster ""multiverse"".My own objection to this book is that most of this material has been written elsewhere -- for starters, Greene's earlier book ""The Elegant Universe"" was an excellent introduction to string theory and its implications. That's a problem with writing a great book -- it's hard to match the same level of excitement in the next book.The other criticism that one might raise is that string theory and the multiverse, in particular, remain highly controversial in the field. Indeed, some scientists (such as Lee Smolin) are saying out loud that string theory has been given too much rope for too long, and it is time to face the reality that it has not produced any crisp, testable hypotheses (nor is it likely to for a while). For the same reasons, many are opposed to the notion of the ""multiverse"", not just for technical reasons but also for philosophical reasons -- how can the hypothesis of an infinity of companion universes, whose existence can only be indirectly suggested, even in principle, qualify as empirical science?"
147,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel,5,"The book focused mainly on the concepts of space and time, and how they build the universe around us. Starting with the concept of space and how that's changed over the years, then time and how that's changed and now the concept of spacetime, and then the universe itself. A large part of the book was used trying to explain, ""time's arrow"" why things go forward but never backwards, why entropy is always greater in the future and never the past. It was all very interesting. At times I did get a bit lost, though not that often, but I feel now I have a much better understanding of a lot of modern physics concepts and ideas, for example I know understand Pbranes user name! I never really understood the big bang, that the universe was expanding, not that things were just getting flung further out into space. I think inflationary cosmology is neat. (even if it doesn't tie everything together). The chapter I enjoyed the most I think had to be looking at the teleportation and possibilities of time travel in the future. It was definitely more on the what if end of physics, but it was very interesting and I really enjoyed his explanations for why there would be no paradox. But it's definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in learning how the universe might work, and how in a lot of ways it does. It made a nice change for me to read a book about a subject I know so little about. While I cannot therefore give an expert opinion about it's accuracy, it was fascinating and I feel like I understand the world a lot more now."

Although the book is maybe a bit too simple at times, I really enjoyed how Greene is able to present some very difficult concepts by gradually building up ideas. Instead of jumping over here and over there, he leads the reader in a very precise (well, as precise as you can get without serious mathematics) and logical manner which seems to be satisfying both to the layman and to the expert. Excellent!"

150,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"I like to talk shit about science sometimes. Sometimes it's just to push people's buttons and other times it's because of the pop side of science is ridiculous (you know like the studies that get quoted on your web-browsers start-up page, which may even be contradicted a few days from now by some other article, or all those fucking pharmaceutical ad's on TV. Hey, thanks Pfizer for helping make me a drug addict!). I just made a slight at pop-science and that is hypocritical of me, it's really the only type of science I can understand and this book basically falls into that category, it's a watered down version of real science so humanities idiots like me can understand concepts that they would stare open mouthed at if they had to read the actual articles about. By the way, I loved this book! Starting with a seemingly simple problem (or I would think it's simple, but it took a few hundred years and Einstein to adequately understand it, apparently (not that I could figure it out) about why the water in a bucket pushes up against the side of the bucket when you spin the bucket around really fast, Brian Green creates a narrative (I'm using this in it's normal manner, not in the science as narrative way that I use it when I want to piss people off, this book is a history of science book in quite a few ways) that shows how this bucket filled with some water paved the way for Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Uncertainty, the Big Bang, String Theory, M-Theory, Branes and other concepts that helped move forward theoretical understandings of the whole universe. Oh, actually the underlying theme to the book is how do we understand the concepts of space and time, or spacetime, which is one of the problems of understanding why the water in the bucket does what it does when it is spun around. Oh, did I mention I loved this book? I feel awkward giving it five stars because I lack the critical acumen to know if Brian Green is really telling the whole story, or if there is a huge bias here because I'm an idiot when it comes to matters like this. I felt like he was being fair though but maybe I was just dazzled by any of the mathematics he would throw into footnotes that I wouldn't have the first idea on what to do with if someone handed me even the simplest one and asked me to solve it. About a hundred pages into the book I had the realization that I should have been more interested in math and science growing up. More exactly I had the realization that the way math and science were taught in the schools I attended did nothing to inspire me at all. I'm fairly certain that most people never use most of the information they learn in science classes. I've never had the need to know all the parts of a flower, but if I had been taught something about what went into discovering some of the biology of (x) or say about the real awesomeness of evolution I'd probably have perked up and gotten interested. Or maybe learned about the difficulties still facing scientists when dealing with the subatomic level, and the weirdness of quantum uncertainty and entanglement might have gotten me more interested and wanting to know more in a chemistry class than endlessly learning how to balance electrons between elements (or whatever that fruitless exercise was called). I know these details are really important to doing science, but without any reason to care about wanting to know about science this is all just monumental busy work. Shouldn't it be the job of schools to get kids to care and wanting to learn rather than forcing meaningless facts onto them? This rantish aside about the misguided importance (pedological approach?) of science education in American schools was just me being bitter. It's too late now, and I'm too dumb in too many areas of knowledge but I should have been a theoretical physicist. That is what I realized reading this book. I wish someone had told me about the weird shit these people try to figure out, explained who Parmenides was and the basic gist of his Poem was, and then told me I could work on these problems for the rest of my life if I started to pay attention in math class and gave a shit about my science classes, that there was cool stuff I'd get to later on. Parmenides is never mentioned in this book, but at almost every step through the book he kept popping into my mind. He's my reoccurring fascination. His idea of the everything just being One at first glance is so silly. I remember the first time reading Zeno's Paradoxes (he was Parmenides student) and thinking they were just silly games with words, obviously something moves faster than something else and can over come it. Obviously an arrow shot at a target eventually hits it. Duh! But sometime soon after my immediate annoyance at these kinds of meaningless games something clicked in me and I started to try to think through what Parmenides could mean by the whole universe being an unchanging, undivisible, timeless thing. A point, if you would. On one level Parmenides can be thought of as the logical foil to the pre-Socratic materialists, the voice that says your theory is nice but what about (x)? I don't buy into the idea that was Parmenides only goal though. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know exactly what Parmenides thought, because of thanks to those motherfucking Christians and Moslems (you know for their multiple burnings of the Library of Alexandria (and Christians for their wanton destruction of 'heretical' literature) we have only a scant few fragments left from Parmenides work, and most of it is second hand from the post-Socratic arch-materialist Aristotle (materialist meaning something sort of different in the Ancient Greek sense than one would think of a materialist today). Are you bored yet?Anyway, back to Parmenides, I don't buy the idea that his role was only as foil, or goad to the materialists to make their theories more logically consistent. Why? Because of Plato. Socrates is bested only twice in the dialogues. First as a young man by Parmenides of Elea (the guy I've been writing about) in Parmenides and second by the Eleatic Stranger in The Sophist and The Statesman (these two dialogues are like a part one and part two to each other). The appearance of the Eleatic Stranger is in the two dialogues that come at the end of Socrates life, before the series of dialogues that make up the trial and death of Socrates. In both instances Socrates is bested in his arguments by the philosophy coming from Elea. Why? Why is the only person who Plato allows to give Socrates a philosophical beat-down either Parmenides or a stand in for him? (Parmenides himself couldn't be in a chronologically later dialogue, since he was an old man when Socrates was a youth). Anyway, long story that doesn't mean too much to anyone probably, but to sum it up Parmenides has been an thought game for me for years now, and many of the ideas that I've had to reconcile what Parmenides means I find in this fucking book, there are people who are seriously considering some of the logical games I play in my head about cosmology, but they have math and ways of actually coming up with answers! I haven't done a good job at it, but to me this is so exciting. It's like all of the crazy shit that philosophers have thought up over the years can be actually studied and not just argued about using a mismash of concepts and logic, but possibly measured and articulated with math and shit! This book is like a validation to the stuff I think about when I'm not just wallowing in self-pity or being sad. Of course, I knew that a lot of this stuff existed before reading this book, but I had no idea what any of it really meant. I just took the words and applied common meanings to them. String Theory? Oh, everything is interconnected with vibrating strings. Actually, no. That's not what String Theory means. Multi-dimensions, you mean like people could be living in a dimension almost on top of me that I don't see because I don't have access to those dimensions, but one day maybe we could, right? No, actually even if the dimensions are big, the word big is being used on a microscopic scale, like the width of a piece of hair big, as opposed to small as in so small we have nothing that can see it. I realized that most of the ways books in the new age section use science terms to validate their ideas and how they claim to be drawing on cutting edge research is bullshit, that they are just picking terms out and using them in ways to sell books on hokum. I realized reading this book that I wish I wasn't so stupid and that I could at least understand this stuff at more than in a non-technical watered down way."
151,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"Did you know that Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect anagram of “A Second Herring Quits”? And is a near perfect anagram of “Surely someone’s taking the piss”? The second anagram relies, of course (and almost entirely), on a rather judicious application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – but I do think that one may be more illuminating of how I’m finding some of the quantum mechanical experiments described in this book. There is part of me that would like to believe that in the early part of the last century (I don’t remember the year, but surely on an April First) a group of European physicists got together and decided to come up with an idea so monumentally ridiculous that it would have them chuckling at the gullibility of we more mathematically challenged for years to come. Einstein was in on the joke at the start, but ended up thinking it had all gone on for far too long. Frynman introduced some slapstick into the equations (in a fine American tradition) – but, as always, it takes an Irishman (John Bell) to put the final touches on the comedy and to make it truly surreal. So, why isn’t anybody laughing?If you are not disturbed by the findings of Quantum Mechanics, well, you’re really not trying hard enough. This is quite some book so far.UpdateOkay, I’ve finished and I’ve had problems with this one. In fact, I have many problems with modern physics and believe that the only way I could really understand it more would be to go back and finish off a degree in this stuff. Since I’m unlikely to do that, I am going to have to accept that this stuff will have to remain a mystery to me. This guy really does try to make this stuff accessible, but I’ve a feeling that without the maths it just does not make any sense on any level.My problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that every time there is a problem in Physics we are having trouble solving we just make up something invisible to solve it. Universe not expanding fast enough? Stuff it full of dark matter. Expanding too fast? Bring back the Cosmological Constant. Can’t make gravity fit in with quantum theory? Postulate string theory. Having trouble with quantum theory? Why not create an infinite number of universes that can’t access each other. Having trouble explaining the vibrations of one dimensional strings? Vibrate them in 11 dimensional space.Bring back the Ether, I say. Physics never seems to do anything by half. Even cosmic inflation seems to have inflated the universe to a ridiculous extent in the first nanosecond of the universe.I don’t believe I can really say anything sensible about any of this stuff. It is so far divorced from my limited understanding that to express an opinion really just makes me feel incredibly ignorant. Like I said, I’m not prepared to learn the maths, so I should just shut up. It is a pity physics has become so esoteric – I would like to be one of its great defenders, to use it as a basis to understand the universe, but I come away from these books feeling someone is having me on.This is a good book, in part. Some of it is still remarkably hard going – even with the allusions to the Simpsons and X Files (I’ve never seen the X Files or some of the other bits of pop culture mentioned, so that made what I took to be some of the jokes quite inaccessible to me – but that will just be me). The stuff about Newton’s Bucket was utterly fascinating and well worth reading. The stuff of string theory was like most stuff on string theory – I’ve virtually no understanding of this stuff and can’t quite follow the controversy that surrounds it. Anyway, it sounds like no one will ever be able to test any of this stuff – if we can’t see an electron how the hell are we ever going to see a one dimensional string?My main problem with this book was his early explanation of entropy and how this did not provide an arrow of time. He says that if you watch a film of an egg falling and braking that you could reverse the film and there is nothing in the laws of physics to decide which direction the film travelled in that must be the right direction. He says that there would be a way to get all the bits of egg to fly back at the right speed and reconstitute. This, of course, is nonsense. It is not a matter of things coming back together at the right speed that is the issue. Have you ever broken a glass? You don’t get the pieces to go back together again by moving them together at the ‘right speed’. They never go back together again. This is a one way reaction. Why? Because once the glass is broken the bonds between the atoms in the glass are broken. Pushing the pieces together again is pushing negatively charged electrons against negatively charged electrons and they will repeal each other, not just nicely bond. There are laws of physics and laws of chemistry that do not allow this reversal. I figure that if I have spotted a flaw in this easy bit of his argument there are too many bits of this argument that I struggled to follow that may be just as equally flawed. (This stuff is from about page 145 – 169)I did learn some interesting stuff from this book – even about entropy. I had no idea that the arrow of entropy was double headed or that inflation was the main cause of order in the young universe. But large parts of this book deal with questions that are simply too esoteric. I ended up knowing that I would never know what was in a black hole or what caused the big bang and basically not really caring. I’m sure this wasn’t Greene’s intention, more is the pity."
152,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Wow, what a wonderful book. What a ride it was. Brian is definitely one of the best science popularisers about, hands down. It is amazing how he manages to convey potentially complex subjects, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, in a simple but at the same time rigorous manner. And he does that with a contagious enthusiasm which reminded to me why I love physics. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he never gets into the game (like so frequently happens in popular science books, unfortunately) of oversimplifying the subject. His book is very readable and he has a great gift of explaining complex subjects with an amazing clarity. While the book may be a bit too simple at times, more quantitative detail is available in the notes at the end of the book (which I strongly recommend you read, to get more detail), and bibliographic references are pretty good. It is a fantastic introductory book to the realm of contemporary physics - of course, if you are interested in more quantitative treatments of such subjects, then this is probably not the book for you - although I must say that everybody with an interest in science should really take the time to read this masterpiece. The author, being a foremost scientist directly involved in the most advanced research efforts in areas such as String Theory, does have his own preferences and biases (all honestly acknowledged by him, and also they do not impact the overall objectivity and impartiality of his book). Moreover, being particle physics an area of such intense and frantic development, there are a couple of area where the book looks a bit dated (for example, even if SUSY is not officially dead, the results coming out of the LHC are such that there is increasing doubt over the real prospects of SUSY and consequently of Super String Theories - although it is completely premature to claim that they are dead).Overall, it is an amazing introductory book, informative, entertaining, lucid, and a complete pleasure to read.

This feeling, this sensation that time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments—previous frames—to be ""sequentially illuminated.""﻿In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian GreeneI agree that this is at least as much philosophy as science, though mathematically based philosophy. But what irks me is that for all the pages of science books devoted to this subject, no one has pointed out that for us to experience moments sequentially (assuming those moments don't themselves move) our mind has to move through those moments. And movement entails time. So while time may be a spatial dimension, if Greene (and Godel, etc.) are right, then there must be at least one other dimension of time that allows our minds to move through the different moments that all exist and experience them sequentially.﻿"
154,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Let's start with the positives: Greene does an excellent job of explaining very hard-to-understand concepts in non-mathematical ways. That said, I think it was unecessary to use popular culture the way he did. It feels silly, reading about Einstein and general relativity and getting an example which uses the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart, and Lisa and so forth. But okay, I admit that this is a fairly small detail that shouldn't take too much away from the overall experience. The important thing is that the concepts are explained in a manner which is understandable. Does Greene do that? He does, for the most part.Furthermore, Greene is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and that is something that is contagious. Reading about the bucket argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_a...) and the various attempts at answering it; the exciting exploration of time, the arrow of time, and its mysteries; the exhilarating explanation of entropy; the outline of general relativity, quantum mechanics and a whole host of other physical theories, and on the whole Greene's passionate way of writing makes this an extremely engaging read. And the subject matter is interesting. I mean, the bending of space and time, particles being ""entangled"" (""spooky action at a distance"") through space, possible hidden dimensions, elusive particles, multiverses.. Paul Erdos said that ""if numbers aren't beautiful, I don't know what is."" Well, if this stuff isn't interesting, I don't know what is! Thus, overall, the book is extremely engaging and exciting, and it's one of those books that are very much, in many ways, unputdownable. Now, the negatives.First of all, the illustrations are almost no help, because they are of awful quality. I read the hardcover version, and even here they are small, with no colour and in fairly awful quality. Another problem with the book has been pointed out in this review as well, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... You get the impression that without the math, a lot of this just isn't really possible to convey properly. You are left with only a part of the picture. I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's words: ""To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."" Sometimes Greene is pretty frank about this. He'll essentially write, ""okay, I know this is far-fetched, but trust me on this one: the math is right, guys."" To Greene's credit, there are a lot of pages in the back of the book devoted to the more mathematically inclined reader, so that those who do get it can check it out for themselves. Now, the last negative aspect of the book is the fact that there's not a whole lot of new things here. If you've read The Elegant Universe, you don't really get a whole lot of new knowledge, except that this book is less about string theory and more about cosmology. I think it's enough to read one of them, which kind of renders this book somewhat unecessary. With all those negatives aside, the book is enjoyable and engaging. If you want some stretching exercises for your imagination, it's not a mistake to pick it up."

""Theoretically there is no absolute proof that one's awakening in the morning (the finding oneself again in the saddle of one's personality) is not really a quite unprecedented event, a perfectly original birth."" Yeah, that does make a bit more sense than most of this book. . . . I'm starting to wish I never listed this here because if I hadn't I could give up without feeling so bad (or anyone knowing). It's not that he's a bad writer it's just that I'm not that smart, but I suppose we all have own unique talents, right? Sure, Brian Greene might understand physics but can he roll a joint while driving his car with his knee? . . . so yeah, I got that going for me at-least . . . That's something, right?"
156,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"You probably know more about physics than you think. See, right there, when your brain registered the p-word, a black hole of anxiety opened up in the pit of your stomach from which nothing can escape. Your underarms began to radiate heat as your mind conjured memories of stuffy high school laboratories. And as your eyes scanned ahead for those dreaded half-English, half-Greek words followed by an equal sign, the probability of you reading on fast approached zero.But there’s hope! Whether you realize it or not, you just visualized some of the more important natural phenomena that govern the world around us. The stomachache was space-time curvature at a point of infinite density. The sweating was a crass simulation of something known as black body radiation. And your waning interest was a metaphor for quantum non-locality. What do these words mean? It doesn’t really matter. Even complicated physical processes were surmountable — even understandable — when they were put into the context of something familiar, say, traumatic experiences of young adulthood.Without analogy and metaphor, a reader can quickly suffocate in the rarified air of the hard sciences. The task then for any science writer is to couch these concepts in colloquial terms and familiar experiences, and no one does it better than Brian Greene. His second of two books, The Fabric of the Cosmos, is a potent distillation of 200 years of discovery and an invaluable roadmap of reality that is almost impossible to get lost with, regardless of your level of scientific knowledge. It is a compelling narrative of the search for understanding that probes the boundaries of human experience. Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, is not the first to attempt such a crash course in physics history and experiment for the non-science minded, and he won’t be the last. In fact, the popularity of this breed of book has even necessitated its own genre, which has come to be known as pop-physics. Make no mistake; it is truly a difficult task to make the revolutionary ideas of hundreds of brilliant people not only digestible, but palatable in fewer than 500 pages. Since you can’t change the elements of the story — an exhaustive historical record of dozens of collaborating countries — good science writing then becomes an exercise in conversational skills, patient instruction and plenty of examples.Greene is adept at all three but his skillful employment of examples is one of the book’s greatest strengths. Throughout the text, he uses objects we experience and protagonists we can visualize to illustrate his points. The Simpsons characters, Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, and former President Bill Clinton all appear on multiple occasions and eggs, snowflakes and bowling balls all serve as props. As juvenile as this might seem, you would be surprised at how effective Greene’s methods are. At one point in the book, he tries to explain how something called the Higgs ocean — typically the focus of a Ph.D. thesis — may give particles like protons and electrons their mass. But he uses a very familiar and somewhat playful example to illustrate the point. “If [a particle] has greater difficulty accelerating through the Higgs ocean, it has a greater mass. If we liken a particle’s mass to a person’s fame, then the Higgs ocean is like the paparazzi: those who are unknown pass through the swarming photographers with ease, but famous politicians and movie stars have to push much harder to reach their destination.”While this technique of using vivid examples seems straight forward, it is actually very easy to mess up and there are a few cardinal sins that many physics authors commit. A common transgression is to sacrifice accuracy for sensationalism under the misconception that science fiction is the only way to engage the average reader. The very talented Michio Kaku of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (the same place Einstein spent the last few decades of his life) is a repeat offender. His most recent work of pop-physics, called Hyperspace, contains examples that are shamelessly unscientific at times and really underestimate the reader’s intelligence.But by no means does Greene dumb down the information in Fabric and yet, none of the underlying ideas are lost. Further, he doesn’t resort to sensationalized hypothetical situations but instead finds a creative way to make the reader appreciate real scientific results. In doing so, he makes it more than understandable. He makes the reader appreciate and even enjoy the excitement of discovery.And if Greene’s delivery of concepts is superb, his thoughtful selection of content only reinforces the readability of the text. The fundamental — and most impressive — difference between Greene and most other science writers is the breadth of the issues he addresses. Another cardinal sin for a science writer is to allow a topic’s complexity to dictate its relevance, which is just a cop out and a disservice to the reader. Gary Zukov, the author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, basically left out entire chapters of vital experimental findings because they were too tough to couch in human experience. But Greene doesn’t succumb to such temptations of writing around difficult material. He acknowledges the complexity of problematic topics and painstakingly walks the reader through the material every time.Unfortunately, some concepts will be beyond analogy and word craft and require at least a cursory digression of technicalities. As Greene puts it: “Human language is far better at capturing human experience than at expressing deep physical laws.” But what is unique about Fabric is that Greene gives the reader the option to get more technical without a loss of continuity. Throughout the text, he would broach a huge topic by putting it into historical context and discussing its relevance in the big physics picture. Often, the section would end with an ultimatum: keep reading to explore the details for a deeper understanding or skip to the next chapter with at least these implications in mind. This “choose your own adventure” organization gives the book a refreshing flexibility that is too often absent from pop-physics novels.Writing style also plays a large role in this work’s success. Richard Feynman, one of the more beloved albeit quirky physicists of the 20th century, was famous for his conversational style physics lessons. Though this made Feynman an incredibly effective educator, he was never able to write a book for want of literary chops. Fabric is such a good read because Greene buttresses the same savvy teaching techniques with an eloquent style of storytelling. Some parts are downright poetic and they uncover the easily missed romance and excitement of scientific discovery. He writes, “By deepening our understanding of the true nature of physical reality, we profoundly reconfigure our sense of ourselves and our experience of the universe.” And other parts are surprisingly suspenseful, especially for a narrative with such well-publicized plot twists. Even though most people know that Albert Einstein would propose his groundbreaking theories of relativity in the early 1900s, until Greene gets to that part of the story, this reader was genuinely concerned about the troublesome relationship between absolute space and time. (Spoiler: It all works out beautifully!)One of the more striking features of The Fabric of the Cosmos is how Greene’s enthusiasm for modern physics almost leaps off the page, making the reader wonder, if only for a second, whether or not the Large Hadron Collider will actually produce spontaneous symmetry breaking of massive scalar bosons. But that’s beside the point. To wonder about the world around us is the first step on the path to scientific discovery and Greene’s work makes it so that anyone can find the way."

Sacks, Sagan, Ramachandran, Richard Simmons, etc. I had never heard of Brian Greene and have typically held physics and such things at arm's length, with my other hand pinching my nose shut as if holding the world's most curious diaper: there is probably much of interest within to parse out, but noxious enough to keep me anyway. This book was recommended to me (okay, it was a present) by a friend who seems to be aware of my constant questioning of the nature of the very fabric of reality itself. Luckily, this book squares a lot of things and sets them to rights for me.Greene is an awesome writer. He's funny and he describes this complicated shizz really well (he likes to make Simpsons analogies). There are few parts that are mind-bending to the point where I got a headache. Greene will outright warn you to skip ahead if its getting too dense, which is nice.As to the actual content? Fuck, it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I'll just say, I came out of the book feeling and sounding smarter. I can rap about three-branes, the Many Worlds hypothesis and impress my friends with my knowledge of the eleven spacetime dimensions.All-in-all, satisfying, funny, and informative."

This book was not the answer to my acquisition of knowledge. In fact, I learned almost nothing from this book. The writing is awful. It seeks to explain through dense prose, repetitive text, asinine pop references and endless in text questions. It really just shows why science writers should write books for the general public, not most scientists. Further, the author is in love with his superstring research and theory, but never convinced me it actually exists. All in all, it’s hard for me to express my disgust with this book. At least my nightmare and dread of reading on with this book have come to an end. I will never read this author again and may just avoid cosmos and superstring science if there’s no better work out there. "
160,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Glancing at the reviews for Brian Greene's overview of how we view the stuff of which our universe is made, it seems that some people base their rating and opinion on how much they agree with the science, or how credible they find it. While I have read a fair few popular science books – especially in the areas of physics and cosmology, areas I find utterly fascinating and about which I am perplexed that anyone can not be astounded and beguiled – I have to assume that I am reading a fair explanation of facts and theories. That is not to say that I assume the author is more knowledgeable than me simply because he has more letters after his name, but because he grounds his claims with background and the weight of evidence that is needed for a scientific hypothesis to become a generally accepted theory. Also, I have taken the effort to educate myself in these areas so have enough grounding myself to be able to appreciate the arguments.That said, for much of this book I'm unsure how much background would be needed to understand the explanations. Greene writes with a clarity and readability which is all too rare in any field, and is particularly welcome in discussing such big ideas. As in Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, Greene completely dispenses with calculations but, unlike Hawking, he also tries to keep the use of metaphor to a minimum. It cannot, of course, be dispensed with completely – metaphors are an extraordinarily powerful descriptive tool, especially in a field that can only properly be explained and understood using specialist mathematics – but for the most part Greene simply gives an overview of each field in historical context, and explains WHY it is important, what it explains and why it works.He starts – as modern physics in so many fields must – with Isaac Newton, and particularly Newton's Bucket. If you hang a bucket of water on a rope and twist the rope, as the rope unwinds, spinning the bucket, at first the water remains stationary until the friction of the bucket's movement makes the water begin to spin. When it does, the surface becomes increasingly concave, moved outward by what why now call centripetal (or centrifugal) force. But what, asked Newton, is the water moving away from, or toward? What is it moving in relation to? He decided that it moved in relation to the fixed fabric of the cosmos, the stuff in which the matter (that he recognised as being the thing on which gravity works) sits. Recognising that he had no way of testing this medium by experiment, Newton took this is an immutable absolute and left it at that. Greene keeps returning to the bucket and its implications throughout the book, to superb explanatory effect.I won't go further into the details (read the book!), but simply say that thanks to Professor Greene I now understand areas of cosmology and physics where I had previously had to simply give in to brain cramp and accept as being true. I understand why the speed of light (actually, the speed of any electromagnetic radiation) is approx 300, 000 km/sec faster than you, no matter how fast you are travelling. I understand a whole lot more about General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and why they make sense and are such powerful tools in describing our universe. I understand that Inflationary Theory is not merely a tweak of Big Bang theory to enable it to fit observed facts, but a whole new way of looking at the growth of the universe that actually explains much more about the fundamental physics.I'm not claiming a thorough understanding of these subjects (and in some, like Brane Theory, I still found myself rather lost; a re-read may be in order), but I feel that The Fabric of the Cosmos has deepened my comprehension of and appreciation for the wonders of our universe. And for the wonders of the human mind to work out these things. In around three hundred years we have developed this system, science, as a means of examining the world around us in a way which is comprehensible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. All books on science now seem to feel the need to restate this about science; it is NOT knowledge passed down from on high by men in white coats using deliberately obfuscatory language for reasons of either professional pride or conspiracy. Science is a method that enables us to understand more and more about the world, to revel in the joy of knowing how the rainbow is formed as well as in its simple beauty. No idea in science is sacrosanct, no theory is holy. To achieve the status of acceptance of say, General Relativity or Evolution by Natural Selection, a theory has to be tested – that is, it has to survive again and again and again the onslaught of people systematically trying to prove it wrong. When a weakness is found the theory must be re-examined. Sometimes the fault will cause the foundations of the theory to crumble, and it will be discarded; it has still served a purpose, to show how promising such an approach is. Sometimes finding the errors will strengthen a theory and teach us more – Edwin Hubble's original calculations of distant galaxies seemed to show the universe to be about 1.5 billion years old, despite lots of other evidence at the time insisting it was at least 3 billion years old (as we now know, this was still almost five times too conservative). Everything else about Hubble's observation and theory made sense, there was simply an error in calculating the distance of the super novae he was using to get the figures, a correction which itself taught us much about the universe.And this is incredibly important to realise because, while many theories, however much work they take, partly make sense on an intuitive level you get to Quantum and Brane theory and they simply cannot – in fact they seem, by intuition and everyday experience, utterly ridiculous (the great physicist Nils Bor said something along the lines of “if you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory”) but they are undoubtedly right. One important way a theory is tested is to use it to make predictions in the physical world and Quantum Theory has been called far and away the most successful predictive theory in science. It is, like every successful theory, one that accurately describes the way our universe works, with the limits of perception and understanding we have, which is why theories are modified or discarded when new information comes along. Which is why General Relativity replaced Newton's Laws of Gravitation as the best description we have for how gravity works – although NASA still use Newton's calculations most of the time, for the same reason you don't need to understand Gaussian Quadratic Maths to balance your chequebook.Greene's book, the first I've read by him, shows why it is worth reading a range of books on the same (or closely connected) areas of science. While in The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinov managed to convey a sense of wonder and discovery on a par with Carl Sagan's writings (a plaudit I don't throw around lightly!), Greene has given us a book that manages a clarity and depth of explanation while being a thoroughly entertaining read. At schools, perhaps instead of training our children into narrowly defined roles, science classes should just be introducing them to the works of Greene and Hawking, Sagan and Tyson (Neil deGrasse, not Mike) and Krauss to show them how huge and wonderful and beautiful the universe is, and how much joy and fulfilment can be achieved through our efforts to understand it."
161,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,5,"What an incredible journey this was. I think Brian is fantastically gifted to explain esoteric and cutting-edge cosmological concepts without the use of formulae and maths. He says himself that he will only use metaphors to explain the ideas, but even so he remains respectful of his subject, he does not dumb things down, and I found the metaphors for the most part evocative and helpful. Towards the end of the book, however, the ideas get so far removed from human intuition that I would have wanted a little more formalism, perhaps. But - this was on offer as well! Brian adds a copious body of footnotes and in this way relegates a more rigorous discussion to the back of the book. This discussion will of course still not satisfy those who have an in-depth understanding of the science involved, but I don't think they are the target group of this book in the first place. To me, this was the best account of the current state (well, it's ten years old, but close enough) of cosmology I have read. The field appears to be so fast-moving that some of his statements in the later chapters have already been overtaken by reality, but there is a special charm in hearing Brian suggest that the LIGO experiment may demonstrate the existence of gravitational waves in decades to come when you know that this has already happened, much sooner than he thought. Equally, I felt a pang of regret when he expresses optimism that the LHC runs may find evidence of extra spatial dimensions soon after the upgrade to higher energies, knowing this has not happened yet, and scepticism is mounting that it ever will.Transcending what Brian was actually teaching me about the science, I also had an epiphany when I was reading the book. Brian talks at length about the shortcomings of the Big Bang theory, and explains how the theory of inflation may answer some of its more frustrating issues, such as the flatness problem. The flatness problem highlights the issue that a tiny difference in origin conditions would have generated a universe entirely different from the one we observe today. Now, I have always thought that this is no mystery, the fact that we are here to observe this universe is the reason we may puzzle about these finetuned conditions, but they are just one in many, equally possible, universes, and our surprise is therefore of our own making. I even thought this position was enlightened, and quite clever. But Brian explained that physicists abhor theories that rely on unknown qualities, on axiomatic pronouncements that accept something as a given. I understood that only by asking ""why"" were physicists able to develop a theory that explains the finetuning, and go beyond the Big Bang as the creation theory of the universe. And this was an excellent lesson to me. I think I knew this once, but I had forgotten about it. In my case, my anthropic stance was actually an attempt on my part to avoid a deeper question, an attempt to posit an answer where there wasn't one yet. Brian reminded me that we must never stop asking ""why"", that asking ""why"" is what makes us human. I loved this book. I can only recommend it to anybody who does not have a formal degree in science and wants to learn more about cosmology but is a bit frustrated about the lack of depth popular accounts of this topic typically provide."

Greene avoids both. This is hands down the best popular intro to modern physics I've found. Even with half a B.S. in physics and formal courses on many of the topics covered, this book consistently kept my interest and taught me new things.Two unique aspects of this book I haven't found elsewhere are (1) its focus on space and time and (2) its enthusiasm. As for (1), most pop sci books on physics focus on trying to convey one or more specific theories (quantum theory, special relativity, string theory, etc) and may discuss space or time in the context of one of these theories but don't make connections between them. Greene actually makes space and time the main character of this story and follows them throughout history and across theories. As for (2), not since Richard Feynman have I found a physicist whose writing makes me shiver with childish delight at the wonders of the universe. Some might find his poetic geeky gushes cheesy, but others (like myself) will spend the next several evenings lying outside on their lawns, staring at the stars, and just basking in the awesomeness of it all.That said, don't expect a book without mathematics to convey a full picture of our current understanding of physics. Nature seems to be written most naturally in the language of mathematics and that is the language in which she must be read. Hopefully though, if you haven't gotten over a particularly frightening encounter with mathematics as a young impressionable child, this book will convince you that it's worth doing.If you:

   are interested in modern physics but don't know where to start 
   have read a few pop sci books or many pop sci articles but want to see how many of the ideas fit together 
   or curious about our past and current understanding of space and time
...then I highly recommend this book, regardless of your background."
164,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This was as very confounding book to me - not confusing but confounding. It has some amazing observations and conundrums to ponder over and I suspect I did not appreciate (or even understand all that it had to tell me).Let me explain - some of the chapters used examples - some of which I have actually studied in my years in education. For example the example where electrons can be treated as particles while at the same time be treated as waves. Now I remember the experiments and I remember the theory that went with them. But I did not associated them with the bigger picture being presented in the chapter. And so the reason why I am confounded- this book challenges many of the scientific notions, a few it takes and builds upon them often reinforcing the notions it is trying to convey. And yet reading this book I feel there is so much more to learn and understand (including some of the sections in the book itself). Ironically looking back at my education I realise that rather than trying to build a foundation for me to build upon I feel like it have been shown how little I know and how so much there is still to explore and learn.Books like this have a variety of effects on me - but this is the first to make me feel so small in the scheme of things. But rather than making it feel a negative experience its almost like a reassurance that you are part of everything and in the right place. As I have said earlier there is more to be learnt from this book - but for now I need let my mind rest as its had a bit of a work out reading these pages. "

We’re storytellers, and what could be more grand than the story of creation?” Admittedly, my head was spinning quite a bit during this read. After all, trying to understand quantum physics is something my brain just isn't wired to do.I love science, and even though volumes like this can be a task to get through, I am always left enlightened and amazed at the facts and philosophies of existence and all that it encompasses. This is not a book I would recommend if you are only wanting to be entertained, but I will say this; several times during this read I snapped out a stupor and realized I had been staring off into space, lost in those thoughts of time, space, and reality.

My only criticism is that Greene can't figure out who his audience is: there's an odd mix of esoterica and the mundane. Most of the esoteric stuff is banished to the footnotes, which are well worth reading--and I suppose I should be happy that it's there at all, since most books on modern science are written with Hawking's Editor's Law in mind: with each equation, your audience shrinks by 90%.

I guess at least now I am familiar enough with the concepts which confuse me to be able to sound like I know something about general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory over beers with friends, and that's the important thing, right?Greene uses lots of pop cultural referenced examples to illustrate difficult mathematic/theoretical constructs, so familiarity with the Simpsons, X-Files, Star Trek and Star Wars may sometimes have you thinking ""hey, I know what he's talking about"" even when you have no clue. I think some of it actually did sink in, so I'm going to recommend this to anyone who desires a primer on the advances in physics & cosmology since e=mc2 but doesn't want to read a bunch of equations."

I really enjoyed the many easy to understand explanations. Also, the book has a lot of material for the reader that even has an intermediate understanding of theoretical physics. So, it's great for a broader range of science buffs.The book covers many of the relevant theoretic physics theories. The books gives a great chronological history of physics itself.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Tkanje Svemira autora Brajana Grina / Heliks 2016 publishing / 592 pages / 159,214 words.Translation was well done."

After reading this book, you'll always have unfinished business in discovering more and more about the universe. This book is a very good intro to physics and discovering about the universe."
171,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951046-john,4,"Lots of really interesting things in this book. I didn't realize physics had progressed so far in finding a unification theory.What I found most interesting would probably horrify the author because, while he didn't say so in so many words, he apparently really believes that physics is, or can be, the answer to everything. I, on the other hand, believe there is a God, the Christian God, who has a hand in our existence.I have always thought it curious that descriptions of God or angels appearing to people seem to be accompanied by bright light and that the supernatural being just appears out of nowhere. Upon reflection this seemed to me very much like them coming out of another dimension. So, what to my surprise, some of the current notions coming out of physics is that reality consists of more dimensions than we currently are able to experience. Score one for angels appearing out of nowhere because they can move from another dimension into our 3-dimensional existence.Then there's the issue of God being omniscient, i.e. knowing everything, past, present, and future. OK, He's God, so I suppose he can know all that, but it seems kind of difficult to figure how He can know the future when it hasn't happened yet. So, what to my surprise again, I learn that physics suggests that space and time are not independent but should be considered spacetime. And (from page 452) ""that moments--the events making up the spacetime loaf--just are. They are timeless. Each moment--each event or happening--exists, just as each point in space exists."" So it appears that someone, God, for instance, who has extent in another dimension outside our spacetime, could presumably see all of our spacetime, past, present, and future. Wow!Now what about free will or agency? Christians believe that people can choose to do good or do evil and are therefore responsible for the consequences. On the other hand (from page 455), ""The laws of classical physics are deterministic. ...if you were to know precisely how things are now (the position and velocity of every particle in the universe), the laws of classical physics would tell you exactly how things were are would be at any other moment you specified. The equations are indifferent to the supposed freedom of human will."" So, according to classical physics, there is no such thing as agency or free will. But then along comes quantum theory and one view is (from page 456), ""...if the passage from probabilities to definite outcomes requires something beyond the standard quantum framework--it's at least possible that free will might find a concrete realization within physical law. We might one day find, as some physicists has speculated, that the act of conscious observation is an integral element of quantum mechanics, being the catalyst that coaxes one outcome from the quantum haze to be realized."" Greene goes on to say, ""Personally, I find this extremely unlikely, but I know of no way to rule it out."" He doesn't like it, but he has the honesty to admit that it's a possibility.Those who have faith that God exists don't, or shouldn't, need science to back Him up. But I've got to admit that it is nice when it does. Of course, as Greene points out, much of what physics proposes is theory that has not been experimentally verified. Some of the above may be supplanted in the future by other theories, but for the time being it is interesting that science seems to verify some of the attributes of God as understood by Christians."
172,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Once again, as in ""The Elegant Universe,"" Greene has done an exemplary job of presenting a ""popular"" explication of deep science (particle physics and cosmology) that is neither condescending nor watered down. I've been amazed both times than anyone could pull this off, since it's been attempted so often but left the subjects either impenetrable or eviscerated.Greene's salient attribute is clarity: He can find and present the basic contours of just about any scientific discipline in clear, disciplined, open outline. He employs several simple, elementary approaches to make this happen.• short, direct, declarative sentences: Beautiful writing with little waste.• analogy: His use of analogy to elucidate arcane concepts is spot on even when (especially when) the comparison seems initially off the wall. I can't, in any way, overestimate the worth of this ability. (Bertrand Russell made a hash of explaining relativity with a raft of confounding, muddying analogies.)• repetition: Greene presents an idea and its details from several different but complementary directions that both reinforce the underlying principles and keep them continually in mind. And he doesn't assume that once he's outlined a concept, you will automatically recall its ramifications three days later. Instead, when he refers to it again, he summarizes it quickly, as if reminding a friend walking with him down a forest path. • basic fairness: Greene has his biases (mostly in favor of string theory and its near relatives), which he never denies. But he gives full credit to the other theorists down the block, admits the failings of the theories he loves and the positive side of the others.• combining inside-outside views: Any enterprise can create a corporate worldview where what you're doing assumes a centrality that the rest of humanity might consider either scary or amusing. Greene is an insider, to different degrees, in the enterprises of mathematics, physics and string theory. Yet he does a pretty complete job of balancing the committed insider against the (more) objective outsider. He speaks equally well for himself, for the wider theoretical community, and to you, looking through the window. Greene's writing and willingness to share himself have grown since ""The Elegant Universe."" It shows most in his humor. He kept it under tight rein in the first work, but here it wanders out to laugh in the sun. ""The Simpsons"" in all their glory rollick throughout the book without apology, and the analogies often have a giggle in them that in no way limits their affect.Some of the elements I'd regretted being missed from ""The Elegant Universe"" are here in detail, in part because of the intervening half decade between publication, but I think more because that's what he's chosen here to add on. You've got dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs field (prior to the way-too-recent discovery of the Higgs boson), inflationary cosmology.I'm looking forward to reading his still more recent work."
173,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"Did Greene plagiarise a section of his book? More on that later.Oh, god, I'm surprised I finished it. For the most part, I enjoy theoretical physics. I'm not sure if I believe everything that theoretical physics proposes (but then again, I'm not one for blindly allowing myself to be pulled along by an entity I can't see), but I enjoy it nonetheless. And I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. Greene offers some thought provoking ideas, and he even mentions at one point the author of one of my favourite theoretical physics books,Lisa Randall. Unfortunately, Greene is unable to translate all his ideas into legible text. I was able to understand some of what he was saying, but after a while, my eyes started to glaze over and I was left puzzling my own existence. Greene tends to throw ideas out there (such as cracked eggs becoming whole again, or ice forming in a glass of warm water and then melting once more) without giving a warning, that leaves the reader wondering if perhaps Greene has lost his marbles in the search for truth. Furthermore, and this may be more a publisher's error, but the book promised discussion on black holes and the like- my favourite of all astronomical topics. However, black holes are only mentioned in depth in the last twenty odd pages. However, there was a chapter on time travel, wormholes and alternate universes, but that was only a short chapter in of itself.There was one segment I did catch that made me sit up and laugh. I only would have caught it because I read Flash Forward by Richard J. Sawyer shortly before this book. Greene and Sawyer both use the same analogy of Gone With the Wind as a way of describing looking through time, in exactly the same manner. Seeing as Sawyer wrote his novel first (back in 1999) and The Fabric of the Cosmos was written in 2004, I can only suspect that Greene was, er, inspired if you will to use it. Still, I'm sure Sawyer would appreciate the credit."
174,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Periodically I get inspired to read big science books aimed at clarifying things to laypeople without any maths. Generally, each time I get slightly further than I did the previous time before eventually losing focus and coasting to the end. This was one of those times. Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.Anyway. Some notes I took:The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!Maxwell/EinsteinMaxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.Quantum MechanicsLight tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.Part 2 - TimeTalks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.Quantum Mechanics + time.If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.CosmologyHubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of Back to the Future.Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. "
175,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"I wish I could say 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' is an easy read which makes clear a subject that only geniuses understand normally about what classic physics and quantum mechanics have to do with understanding the mysteries of cosmology, particularly the theories regarding what the universe is, how it began, what made it function the way it does and why there seems to be an arrow of Time. I can't. Physics is too hard for me. However, Brian Greene is a brilliant man with a teacher's magic talent of sussing out how to simplify and explain difficult complexities of scientific thought. His book 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' did not lose me until the final six chapters! Gentle reader, I highly recommend this book.Physics is not only about observations and experiments, it is mostly about interpreting horribly complicated maths. Fortunately, Brian Greene leaves the math for the 'Notes' section in the back of this book while describing through analogies and simple-as-possible, and logical, well-written historical vignettes about the key physics discoveries by famous physicists which illuminate the nature of space and time. Each step of increasing scientific knowledge important to cosmology is described in a logical procession of conclusions, facts and theories, chapter by chapter. I finally understood many much briefer and out-of-context explanations in science articles which I have occasionally read. (However, I think I will not remember much of this enlightenment in a few weeks, alas.)The newest theories and guesses, described in chapters 12-16, about three-branes and brane splats, extra dimensions, string theory holograms, super-symmetry particle spinning, potential energy bowls, free will (yes, I said free will), five-string theories, two 'Big Bang' theories, and loop quantum gravity, by these genius scientists are the hardest of all to understand by this ordinary mortal, gentle reader, but perseverance with 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' DID make a small collapse of probabilities in the jittering mass of my excited brain particles so that this cat was radiant with more intelligence upon exiting the ebook. Unfortunately, though, I have a feeling this enlightenment is but a moon's dim reflective glow, gone as soon as the sun rises."
176,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is a nice overview of modern physics, including implications of relativity (specific and general), quantum mechanics and string theory, together with a discussion of the implications for cosmology. Some of the interesting items discussed here include the notion that during the ""Planck time"", ie, 10^(-34) sec or so after the Big Bang, space and time had no meaning, that our 3-D universe may be only an illusion of an underlying 11-dimensional universe, and reality may be coded in a cosmic ""hologram"", and that our universe may be only a minor dot in an incomparably vaster ""multiverse"".My own objection to this book is that most of this material has been written elsewhere -- for starters, Greene's earlier book ""The Elegant Universe"" was an excellent introduction to string theory and its implications. That's a problem with writing a great book -- it's hard to match the same level of excitement in the next book.The other criticism that one might raise is that string theory and the multiverse, in particular, remain highly controversial in the field. Indeed, some scientists (such as Lee Smolin) are saying out loud that string theory has been given too much rope for too long, and it is time to face the reality that it has not produced any crisp, testable hypotheses (nor is it likely to for a while). For the same reasons, many are opposed to the notion of the ""multiverse"", not just for technical reasons but also for philosophical reasons -- how can the hypothesis of an infinity of companion universes, whose existence can only be indirectly suggested, even in principle, qualify as empirical science?"
177,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel,5,"The book focused mainly on the concepts of space and time, and how they build the universe around us. Starting with the concept of space and how that's changed over the years, then time and how that's changed and now the concept of spacetime, and then the universe itself. A large part of the book was used trying to explain, ""time's arrow"" why things go forward but never backwards, why entropy is always greater in the future and never the past. It was all very interesting. At times I did get a bit lost, though not that often, but I feel now I have a much better understanding of a lot of modern physics concepts and ideas, for example I know understand Pbranes user name! I never really understood the big bang, that the universe was expanding, not that things were just getting flung further out into space. I think inflationary cosmology is neat. (even if it doesn't tie everything together). The chapter I enjoyed the most I think had to be looking at the teleportation and possibilities of time travel in the future. It was definitely more on the what if end of physics, but it was very interesting and I really enjoyed his explanations for why there would be no paradox. But it's definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in learning how the universe might work, and how in a lot of ways it does. It made a nice change for me to read a book about a subject I know so little about. While I cannot therefore give an expert opinion about it's accuracy, it was fascinating and I feel like I understand the world a lot more now."

Instead of jumping over here and over there, he leads the reader in a very precise (well, as precise as you can get without serious mathematics) and logical manner which seems to be satisfying both to the layman and to the expert. Excellent!"

180,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"I like to talk shit about science sometimes. Sometimes it's just to push people's buttons and other times it's because of the pop side of science is ridiculous (you know like the studies that get quoted on your web-browsers start-up page, which may even be contradicted a few days from now by some other article, or all those fucking pharmaceutical ad's on TV. Hey, thanks Pfizer for helping make me a drug addict!). I just made a slight at pop-science and that is hypocritical of me, it's really the only type of science I can understand and this book basically falls into that category, it's a watered down version of real science so humanities idiots like me can understand concepts that they would stare open mouthed at if they had to read the actual articles about. By the way, I loved this book! Starting with a seemingly simple problem (or I would think it's simple, but it took a few hundred years and Einstein to adequately understand it, apparently (not that I could figure it out) about why the water in a bucket pushes up against the side of the bucket when you spin the bucket around really fast, Brian Green creates a narrative (I'm using this in it's normal manner, not in the science as narrative way that I use it when I want to piss people off, this book is a history of science book in quite a few ways) that shows how this bucket filled with some water paved the way for Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Uncertainty, the Big Bang, String Theory, M-Theory, Branes and other concepts that helped move forward theoretical understandings of the whole universe. Oh, actually the underlying theme to the book is how do we understand the concepts of space and time, or spacetime, which is one of the problems of understanding why the water in the bucket does what it does when it is spun around. Oh, did I mention I loved this book? I feel awkward giving it five stars because I lack the critical acumen to know if Brian Green is really telling the whole story, or if there is a huge bias here because I'm an idiot when it comes to matters like this. I felt like he was being fair though but maybe I was just dazzled by any of the mathematics he would throw into footnotes that I wouldn't have the first idea on what to do with if someone handed me even the simplest one and asked me to solve it. About a hundred pages into the book I had the realization that I should have been more interested in math and science growing up. More exactly I had the realization that the way math and science were taught in the schools I attended did nothing to inspire me at all. I'm fairly certain that most people never use most of the information they learn in science classes. I've never had the need to know all the parts of a flower, but if I had been taught something about what went into discovering some of the biology of (x) or say about the real awesomeness of evolution I'd probably have perked up and gotten interested. Or maybe learned about the difficulties still facing scientists when dealing with the subatomic level, and the weirdness of quantum uncertainty and entanglement might have gotten me more interested and wanting to know more in a chemistry class than endlessly learning how to balance electrons between elements (or whatever that fruitless exercise was called). I know these details are really important to doing science, but without any reason to care about wanting to know about science this is all just monumental busy work. Shouldn't it be the job of schools to get kids to care and wanting to learn rather than forcing meaningless facts onto them? This rantish aside about the misguided importance (pedological approach?) of science education in American schools was just me being bitter. It's too late now, and I'm too dumb in too many areas of knowledge but I should have been a theoretical physicist. That is what I realized reading this book. I wish someone had told me about the weird shit these people try to figure out, explained who Parmenides was and the basic gist of his Poem was, and then told me I could work on these problems for the rest of my life if I started to pay attention in math class and gave a shit about my science classes, that there was cool stuff I'd get to later on. Parmenides is never mentioned in this book, but at almost every step through the book he kept popping into my mind. He's my reoccurring fascination. His idea of the everything just being One at first glance is so silly. I remember the first time reading Zeno's Paradoxes (he was Parmenides student) and thinking they were just silly games with words, obviously something moves faster than something else and can over come it. Obviously an arrow shot at a target eventually hits it. Duh! But sometime soon after my immediate annoyance at these kinds of meaningless games something clicked in me and I started to try to think through what Parmenides could mean by the whole universe being an unchanging, undivisible, timeless thing. A point, if you would. On one level Parmenides can be thought of as the logical foil to the pre-Socratic materialists, the voice that says your theory is nice but what about (x)? I don't buy into the idea that was Parmenides only goal though. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know exactly what Parmenides thought, because of thanks to those motherfucking Christians and Moslems (you know for their multiple burnings of the Library of Alexandria (and Christians for their wanton destruction of 'heretical' literature) we have only a scant few fragments left from Parmenides work, and most of it is second hand from the post-Socratic arch-materialist Aristotle (materialist meaning something sort of different in the Ancient Greek sense than one would think of a materialist today). Are you bored yet?Anyway, back to Parmenides, I don't buy the idea that his role was only as foil, or goad to the materialists to make their theories more logically consistent. Why? Because of Plato. Socrates is bested only twice in the dialogues. First as a young man by Parmenides of Elea (the guy I've been writing about) in Parmenides and second by the Eleatic Stranger in The Sophist and The Statesman (these two dialogues are like a part one and part two to each other). The appearance of the Eleatic Stranger is in the two dialogues that come at the end of Socrates life, before the series of dialogues that make up the trial and death of Socrates. In both instances Socrates is bested in his arguments by the philosophy coming from Elea. Why? Why is the only person who Plato allows to give Socrates a philosophical beat-down either Parmenides or a stand in for him? (Parmenides himself couldn't be in a chronologically later dialogue, since he was an old man when Socrates was a youth). Anyway, long story that doesn't mean too much to anyone probably, but to sum it up Parmenides has been an thought game for me for years now, and many of the ideas that I've had to reconcile what Parmenides means I find in this fucking book, there are people who are seriously considering some of the logical games I play in my head about cosmology, but they have math and ways of actually coming up with answers! I haven't done a good job at it, but to me this is so exciting. It's like all of the crazy shit that philosophers have thought up over the years can be actually studied and not just argued about using a mismash of concepts and logic, but possibly measured and articulated with math and shit! This book is like a validation to the stuff I think about when I'm not just wallowing in self-pity or being sad. Of course, I knew that a lot of this stuff existed before reading this book, but I had no idea what any of it really meant. I just took the words and applied common meanings to them. String Theory? Oh, everything is interconnected with vibrating strings. Actually, no. That's not what String Theory means. Multi-dimensions, you mean like people could be living in a dimension almost on top of me that I don't see because I don't have access to those dimensions, but one day maybe we could, right? No, actually even if the dimensions are big, the word big is being used on a microscopic scale, like the width of a piece of hair big, as opposed to small as in so small we have nothing that can see it. I realized that most of the ways books in the new age section use science terms to validate their ideas and how they claim to be drawing on cutting edge research is bullshit, that they are just picking terms out and using them in ways to sell books on hokum. I realized reading this book that I wish I wasn't so stupid and that I could at least understand this stuff at more than in a non-technical watered down way."
181,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"Did you know that Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect anagram of “A Second Herring Quits”? And is a near perfect anagram of “Surely someone’s taking the piss”? The second anagram relies, of course (and almost entirely), on a rather judicious application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – but I do think that one may be more illuminating of how I’m finding some of the quantum mechanical experiments described in this book. There is part of me that would like to believe that in the early part of the last century (I don’t remember the year, but surely on an April First) a group of European physicists got together and decided to come up with an idea so monumentally ridiculous that it would have them chuckling at the gullibility of we more mathematically challenged for years to come. Einstein was in on the joke at the start, but ended up thinking it had all gone on for far too long. Frynman introduced some slapstick into the equations (in a fine American tradition) – but, as always, it takes an Irishman (John Bell) to put the final touches on the comedy and to make it truly surreal. So, why isn’t anybody laughing?If you are not disturbed by the findings of Quantum Mechanics, well, you’re really not trying hard enough. This is quite some book so far.UpdateOkay, I’ve finished and I’ve had problems with this one. In fact, I have many problems with modern physics and believe that the only way I could really understand it more would be to go back and finish off a degree in this stuff. Since I’m unlikely to do that, I am going to have to accept that this stuff will have to remain a mystery to me. This guy really does try to make this stuff accessible, but I’ve a feeling that without the maths it just does not make any sense on any level.My problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that every time there is a problem in Physics we are having trouble solving we just make up something invisible to solve it. Universe not expanding fast enough? Stuff it full of dark matter. Expanding too fast? Bring back the Cosmological Constant. Can’t make gravity fit in with quantum theory? Postulate string theory. Having trouble with quantum theory? Why not create an infinite number of universes that can’t access each other. Having trouble explaining the vibrations of one dimensional strings? Vibrate them in 11 dimensional space.Bring back the Ether, I say. Physics never seems to do anything by half. Even cosmic inflation seems to have inflated the universe to a ridiculous extent in the first nanosecond of the universe.I don’t believe I can really say anything sensible about any of this stuff. It is so far divorced from my limited understanding that to express an opinion really just makes me feel incredibly ignorant. Like I said, I’m not prepared to learn the maths, so I should just shut up. It is a pity physics has become so esoteric – I would like to be one of its great defenders, to use it as a basis to understand the universe, but I come away from these books feeling someone is having me on.This is a good book, in part. Some of it is still remarkably hard going – even with the allusions to the Simpsons and X Files (I’ve never seen the X Files or some of the other bits of pop culture mentioned, so that made what I took to be some of the jokes quite inaccessible to me – but that will just be me). The stuff about Newton’s Bucket was utterly fascinating and well worth reading. The stuff of string theory was like most stuff on string theory – I’ve virtually no understanding of this stuff and can’t quite follow the controversy that surrounds it. Anyway, it sounds like no one will ever be able to test any of this stuff – if we can’t see an electron how the hell are we ever going to see a one dimensional string?My main problem with this book was his early explanation of entropy and how this did not provide an arrow of time. He says that if you watch a film of an egg falling and braking that you could reverse the film and there is nothing in the laws of physics to decide which direction the film travelled in that must be the right direction. He says that there would be a way to get all the bits of egg to fly back at the right speed and reconstitute. This, of course, is nonsense. It is not a matter of things coming back together at the right speed that is the issue. Have you ever broken a glass? You don’t get the pieces to go back together again by moving them together at the ‘right speed’. They never go back together again. This is a one way reaction. Why? Because once the glass is broken the bonds between the atoms in the glass are broken. Pushing the pieces together again is pushing negatively charged electrons against negatively charged electrons and they will repeal each other, not just nicely bond. There are laws of physics and laws of chemistry that do not allow this reversal. I figure that if I have spotted a flaw in this easy bit of his argument there are too many bits of this argument that I struggled to follow that may be just as equally flawed. (This stuff is from about page 145 – 169)I did learn some interesting stuff from this book – even about entropy. I had no idea that the arrow of entropy was double headed or that inflation was the main cause of order in the young universe. But large parts of this book deal with questions that are simply too esoteric. I ended up knowing that I would never know what was in a black hole or what caused the big bang and basically not really caring. I’m sure this wasn’t Greene’s intention, more is the pity."
182,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Wow, what a wonderful book. What a ride it was. Brian is definitely one of the best science popularisers about, hands down. It is amazing how he manages to convey potentially complex subjects, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, in a simple but at the same time rigorous manner. And he does that with a contagious enthusiasm which reminded to me why I love physics. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he never gets into the game (like so frequently happens in popular science books, unfortunately) of oversimplifying the subject. His book is very readable and he has a great gift of explaining complex subjects with an amazing clarity. While the book may be a bit too simple at times, more quantitative detail is available in the notes at the end of the book (which I strongly recommend you read, to get more detail), and bibliographic references are pretty good. It is a fantastic introductory book to the realm of contemporary physics - of course, if you are interested in more quantitative treatments of such subjects, then this is probably not the book for you - although I must say that everybody with an interest in science should really take the time to read this masterpiece. The author, being a foremost scientist directly involved in the most advanced research efforts in areas such as String Theory, does have his own preferences and biases (all honestly acknowledged by him, and also they do not impact the overall objectivity and impartiality of his book). Moreover, being particle physics an area of such intense and frantic development, there are a couple of area where the book looks a bit dated (for example, even if SUSY is not officially dead, the results coming out of the LHC are such that there is increasing doubt over the real prospects of SUSY and consequently of Super String Theories - although it is completely premature to claim that they are dead).Overall, it is an amazing introductory book, informative, entertaining, lucid, and a complete pleasure to read.

This feeling, this sensation that time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments—previous frames—to be ""sequentially illuminated.""﻿In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian GreeneI agree that this is at least as much philosophy as science, though mathematically based philosophy. But what irks me is that for all the pages of science books devoted to this subject, no one has pointed out that for us to experience moments sequentially (assuming those moments don't themselves move) our mind has to move through those moments. And movement entails time. So while time may be a spatial dimension, if Greene (and Godel, etc.) are right, then there must be at least one other dimension of time that allows our minds to move through the different moments that all exist and experience them sequentially.﻿"
184,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Let's start with the positives: Greene does an excellent job of explaining very hard-to-understand concepts in non-mathematical ways. That said, I think it was unecessary to use popular culture the way he did. It feels silly, reading about Einstein and general relativity and getting an example which uses the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart, and Lisa and so forth. But okay, I admit that this is a fairly small detail that shouldn't take too much away from the overall experience. The important thing is that the concepts are explained in a manner which is understandable. Does Greene do that? He does, for the most part.Furthermore, Greene is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and that is something that is contagious. Reading about the bucket argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_a...) and the various attempts at answering it; the exciting exploration of time, the arrow of time, and its mysteries; the exhilarating explanation of entropy; the outline of general relativity, quantum mechanics and a whole host of other physical theories, and on the whole Greene's passionate way of writing makes this an extremely engaging read. And the subject matter is interesting. I mean, the bending of space and time, particles being ""entangled"" (""spooky action at a distance"") through space, possible hidden dimensions, elusive particles, multiverses.. Paul Erdos said that ""if numbers aren't beautiful, I don't know what is."" Well, if this stuff isn't interesting, I don't know what is! Thus, overall, the book is extremely engaging and exciting, and it's one of those books that are very much, in many ways, unputdownable. Now, the negatives.First of all, the illustrations are almost no help, because they are of awful quality. I read the hardcover version, and even here they are small, with no colour and in fairly awful quality. Another problem with the book has been pointed out in this review as well, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... You get the impression that without the math, a lot of this just isn't really possible to convey properly. You are left with only a part of the picture. I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's words: ""To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."" Sometimes Greene is pretty frank about this. He'll essentially write, ""okay, I know this is far-fetched, but trust me on this one: the math is right, guys."" To Greene's credit, there are a lot of pages in the back of the book devoted to the more mathematically inclined reader, so that those who do get it can check it out for themselves. Now, the last negative aspect of the book is the fact that there's not a whole lot of new things here. If you've read The Elegant Universe, you don't really get a whole lot of new knowledge, except that this book is less about string theory and more about cosmology. I think it's enough to read one of them, which kind of renders this book somewhat unecessary. With all those negatives aside, the book is enjoyable and engaging. If you want some stretching exercises for your imagination, it's not a mistake to pick it up."

""Theoretically there is no absolute proof that one's awakening in the morning (the finding oneself again in the saddle of one's personality) is not really a quite unprecedented event, a perfectly original birth."" Yeah, that does make a bit more sense than most of this book. . . . I'm starting to wish I never listed this here because if I hadn't I could give up without feeling so bad (or anyone knowing). It's not that he's a bad writer it's just that I'm not that smart, but I suppose we all have own unique talents, right?

186,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"You probably know more about physics than you think. See, right there, when your brain registered the p-word, a black hole of anxiety opened up in the pit of your stomach from which nothing can escape. Your underarms began to radiate heat as your mind conjured memories of stuffy high school laboratories. And as your eyes scanned ahead for those dreaded half-English, half-Greek words followed by an equal sign, the probability of you reading on fast approached zero.But there’s hope! Whether you realize it or not, you just visualized some of the more important natural phenomena that govern the world around us. The stomachache was space-time curvature at a point of infinite density. The sweating was a crass simulation of something known as black body radiation. And your waning interest was a metaphor for quantum non-locality. What do these words mean? It doesn’t really matter. Even complicated physical processes were surmountable — even understandable — when they were put into the context of something familiar, say, traumatic experiences of young adulthood.Without analogy and metaphor, a reader can quickly suffocate in the rarified air of the hard sciences. The task then for any science writer is to couch these concepts in colloquial terms and familiar experiences, and no one does it better than Brian Greene. His second of two books, The Fabric of the Cosmos, is a potent distillation of 200 years of discovery and an invaluable roadmap of reality that is almost impossible to get lost with, regardless of your level of scientific knowledge. It is a compelling narrative of the search for understanding that probes the boundaries of human experience. Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, is not the first to attempt such a crash course in physics history and experiment for the non-science minded, and he won’t be the last. In fact, the popularity of this breed of book has even necessitated its own genre, which has come to be known as pop-physics. Make no mistake; it is truly a difficult task to make the revolutionary ideas of hundreds of brilliant people not only digestible, but palatable in fewer than 500 pages. Since you can’t change the elements of the story — an exhaustive historical record of dozens of collaborating countries — good science writing then becomes an exercise in conversational skills, patient instruction and plenty of examples.Greene is adept at all three but his skillful employment of examples is one of the book’s greatest strengths. Throughout the text, he uses objects we experience and protagonists we can visualize to illustrate his points. The Simpsons characters, Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, and former President Bill Clinton all appear on multiple occasions and eggs, snowflakes and bowling balls all serve as props. As juvenile as this might seem, you would be surprised at how effective Greene’s methods are. At one point in the book, he tries to explain how something called the Higgs ocean — typically the focus of a Ph.D. thesis — may give particles like protons and electrons their mass. But he uses a very familiar and somewhat playful example to illustrate the point. “If [a particle] has greater difficulty accelerating through the Higgs ocean, it has a greater mass. If we liken a particle’s mass to a person’s fame, then the Higgs ocean is like the paparazzi: those who are unknown pass through the swarming photographers with ease, but famous politicians and movie stars have to push much harder to reach their destination.”While this technique of using vivid examples seems straight forward, it is actually very easy to mess up and there are a few cardinal sins that many physics authors commit. A common transgression is to sacrifice accuracy for sensationalism under the misconception that science fiction is the only way to engage the average reader. The very talented Michio Kaku of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (the same place Einstein spent the last few decades of his life) is a repeat offender. His most recent work of pop-physics, called Hyperspace, contains examples that are shamelessly unscientific at times and really underestimate the reader’s intelligence.But by no means does Greene dumb down the information in Fabric and yet, none of the underlying ideas are lost. Further, he doesn’t resort to sensationalized hypothetical situations but instead finds a creative way to make the reader appreciate real scientific results. In doing so, he makes it more than understandable. He makes the reader appreciate and even enjoy the excitement of discovery.And if Greene’s delivery of concepts is superb, his thoughtful selection of content only reinforces the readability of the text. The fundamental — and most impressive — difference between Greene and most other science writers is the breadth of the issues he addresses. Another cardinal sin for a science writer is to allow a topic’s complexity to dictate its relevance, which is just a cop out and a disservice to the reader. Gary Zukov, the author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, basically left out entire chapters of vital experimental findings because they were too tough to couch in human experience. But Greene doesn’t succumb to such temptations of writing around difficult material. He acknowledges the complexity of problematic topics and painstakingly walks the reader through the material every time.Unfortunately, some concepts will be beyond analogy and word craft and require at least a cursory digression of technicalities. As Greene puts it: “Human language is far better at capturing human experience than at expressing deep physical laws.” But what is unique about Fabric is that Greene gives the reader the option to get more technical without a loss of continuity. Throughout the text, he would broach a huge topic by putting it into historical context and discussing its relevance in the big physics picture. Often, the section would end with an ultimatum: keep reading to explore the details for a deeper understanding or skip to the next chapter with at least these implications in mind. This “choose your own adventure” organization gives the book a refreshing flexibility that is too often absent from pop-physics novels.Writing style also plays a large role in this work’s success. Richard Feynman, one of the more beloved albeit quirky physicists of the 20th century, was famous for his conversational style physics lessons. Though this made Feynman an incredibly effective educator, he was never able to write a book for want of literary chops. Fabric is such a good read because Greene buttresses the same savvy teaching techniques with an eloquent style of storytelling. Some parts are downright poetic and they uncover the easily missed romance and excitement of scientific discovery. He writes, “By deepening our understanding of the true nature of physical reality, we profoundly reconfigure our sense of ourselves and our experience of the universe.” And other parts are surprisingly suspenseful, especially for a narrative with such well-publicized plot twists. Even though most people know that Albert Einstein would propose his groundbreaking theories of relativity in the early 1900s, until Greene gets to that part of the story, this reader was genuinely concerned about the troublesome relationship between absolute space and time. (Spoiler: It all works out beautifully!)One of the more striking features of The Fabric of the Cosmos is how Greene’s enthusiasm for modern physics almost leaps off the page, making the reader wonder, if only for a second, whether or not the Large Hadron Collider will actually produce spontaneous symmetry breaking of massive scalar bosons. But that’s beside the point. To wonder about the world around us is the first step on the path to scientific discovery and Greene’s work makes it so that anyone can find the way."

Sacks, Sagan, Ramachandran, Richard Simmons, etc. I had never heard of Brian Greene and have typically held physics and such things at arm's length, with my other hand pinching my nose shut as if holding the world's most curious diaper: there is probably much of interest within to parse out, but noxious enough to keep me anyway. This book was recommended to me (okay, it was a present) by a friend who seems to be aware of my constant questioning of the nature of the very fabric of reality itself. Luckily, this book squares a lot of things and sets them to rights for me.Greene is an awesome writer. He's funny and he describes this complicated shizz really well (he likes to make Simpsons analogies). There are few parts that are mind-bending to the point where I got a headache. Greene will outright warn you to skip ahead if its getting too dense, which is nice.As to the actual content? Fuck, it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I'll just say, I came out of the book feeling and sounding smarter. I can rap about three-branes, the Many Worlds hypothesis and impress my friends with my knowledge of the eleven spacetime dimensions.All-in-all, satisfying, funny, and informative."

This book was not the answer to my acquisition of knowledge. In fact, I learned almost nothing from this book. The writing is awful. It seeks to explain through dense prose, repetitive text, asinine pop references and endless in text questions. It really just shows why science writers should write books for the general public, not most scientists. Further, the author is in love with his superstring research and theory, but never convinced me it actually exists. All in all, it’s hard for me to express my disgust with this book. At least my nightmare and dread of reading on with this book have come to an end.

190,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Glancing at the reviews for Brian Greene's overview of how we view the stuff of which our universe is made, it seems that some people base their rating and opinion on how much they agree with the science, or how credible they find it. While I have read a fair few popular science books – especially in the areas of physics and cosmology, areas I find utterly fascinating and about which I am perplexed that anyone can not be astounded and beguiled – I have to assume that I am reading a fair explanation of facts and theories. That is not to say that I assume the author is more knowledgeable than me simply because he has more letters after his name, but because he grounds his claims with background and the weight of evidence that is needed for a scientific hypothesis to become a generally accepted theory. Also, I have taken the effort to educate myself in these areas so have enough grounding myself to be able to appreciate the arguments.That said, for much of this book I'm unsure how much background would be needed to understand the explanations. Greene writes with a clarity and readability which is all too rare in any field, and is particularly welcome in discussing such big ideas. As in Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, Greene completely dispenses with calculations but, unlike Hawking, he also tries to keep the use of metaphor to a minimum. It cannot, of course, be dispensed with completely – metaphors are an extraordinarily powerful descriptive tool, especially in a field that can only properly be explained and understood using specialist mathematics – but for the most part Greene simply gives an overview of each field in historical context, and explains WHY it is important, what it explains and why it works.He starts – as modern physics in so many fields must – with Isaac Newton, and particularly Newton's Bucket. If you hang a bucket of water on a rope and twist the rope, as the rope unwinds, spinning the bucket, at first the water remains stationary until the friction of the bucket's movement makes the water begin to spin. When it does, the surface becomes increasingly concave, moved outward by what why now call centripetal (or centrifugal) force. But what, asked Newton, is the water moving away from, or toward? What is it moving in relation to? He decided that it moved in relation to the fixed fabric of the cosmos, the stuff in which the matter (that he recognised as being the thing on which gravity works) sits. Recognising that he had no way of testing this medium by experiment, Newton took this is an immutable absolute and left it at that. Greene keeps returning to the bucket and its implications throughout the book, to superb explanatory effect.I won't go further into the details (read the book!), but simply say that thanks to Professor Greene I now understand areas of cosmology and physics where I had previously had to simply give in to brain cramp and accept as being true. I understand why the speed of light (actually, the speed of any electromagnetic radiation) is approx 300, 000 km/sec faster than you, no matter how fast you are travelling. I understand a whole lot more about General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and why they make sense and are such powerful tools in describing our universe. I understand that Inflationary Theory is not merely a tweak of Big Bang theory to enable it to fit observed facts, but a whole new way of looking at the growth of the universe that actually explains much more about the fundamental physics.I'm not claiming a thorough understanding of these subjects (and in some, like Brane Theory, I still found myself rather lost; a re-read may be in order), but I feel that The Fabric of the Cosmos has deepened my comprehension of and appreciation for the wonders of our universe. And for the wonders of the human mind to work out these things. In around three hundred years we have developed this system, science, as a means of examining the world around us in a way which is comprehensible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. All books on science now seem to feel the need to restate this about science; it is NOT knowledge passed down from on high by men in white coats using deliberately obfuscatory language for reasons of either professional pride or conspiracy. Science is a method that enables us to understand more and more about the world, to revel in the joy of knowing how the rainbow is formed as well as in its simple beauty. No idea in science is sacrosanct, no theory is holy. To achieve the status of acceptance of say, General Relativity or Evolution by Natural Selection, a theory has to be tested – that is, it has to survive again and again and again the onslaught of people systematically trying to prove it wrong. When a weakness is found the theory must be re-examined. Sometimes the fault will cause the foundations of the theory to crumble, and it will be discarded; it has still served a purpose, to show how promising such an approach is. Sometimes finding the errors will strengthen a theory and teach us more – Edwin Hubble's original calculations of distant galaxies seemed to show the universe to be about 1.5 billion years old, despite lots of other evidence at the time insisting it was at least 3 billion years old (as we now know, this was still almost five times too conservative). Everything else about Hubble's observation and theory made sense, there was simply an error in calculating the distance of the super novae he was using to get the figures, a correction which itself taught us much about the universe.And this is incredibly important to realise because, while many theories, however much work they take, partly make sense on an intuitive level you get to Quantum and Brane theory and they simply cannot – in fact they seem, by intuition and everyday experience, utterly ridiculous (the great physicist Nils Bor said something along the lines of “if you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory”) but they are undoubtedly right. One important way a theory is tested is to use it to make predictions in the physical world and Quantum Theory has been called far and away the most successful predictive theory in science. It is, like every successful theory, one that accurately describes the way our universe works, with the limits of perception and understanding we have, which is why theories are modified or discarded when new information comes along. Which is why General Relativity replaced Newton's Laws of Gravitation as the best description we have for how gravity works – although NASA still use Newton's calculations most of the time, for the same reason you don't need to understand Gaussian Quadratic Maths to balance your chequebook.Greene's book, the first I've read by him, shows why it is worth reading a range of books on the same (or closely connected) areas of science. While in The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinov managed to convey a sense of wonder and discovery on a par with Carl Sagan's writings (a plaudit I don't throw around lightly!), Greene has given us a book that manages a clarity and depth of explanation while being a thoroughly entertaining read. At schools, perhaps instead of training our children into narrowly defined roles, science classes should just be introducing them to the works of Greene and Hawking, Sagan and Tyson (Neil deGrasse, not Mike) and Krauss to show them how huge and wonderful and beautiful the universe is, and how much joy and fulfilment can be achieved through our efforts to understand it."

I think Brian is fantastically gifted to explain esoteric and cutting-edge cosmological concepts without the use of formulae and maths. He says himself that he will only use metaphors to explain the ideas, but even so he remains respectful of his subject, he does not dumb things down, and I found the metaphors for the most part evocative and helpful. Towards the end of the book, however, the ideas get so far removed from human intuition that I would have wanted a little more formalism, perhaps. But - this was on offer as well! Brian adds a copious body of footnotes and in this way relegates a more rigorous discussion to the back of the book. This discussion will of course still not satisfy those who have an in-depth understanding of the science involved, but I don't think they are the target group of this book in the first place. To me, this was the best account of the current state (well, it's ten years old, but close enough) of cosmology I have read. The field appears to be so fast-moving that some of his statements in the later chapters have already been overtaken by reality, but there is a special charm in hearing Brian suggest that the LIGO experiment may demonstrate the existence of gravitational waves in decades to come when you know that this has already happened, much sooner than he thought. Equally, I felt a pang of regret when he expresses optimism that the LHC runs may find evidence of extra spatial dimensions soon after the upgrade to higher energies, knowing this has not happened yet, and scepticism is mounting that it ever will.Transcending what Brian was actually teaching me about the science, I also had an epiphany when I was reading the book. Brian talks at length about the shortcomings of the Big Bang theory, and explains how the theory of inflation may answer some of its more frustrating issues, such as the flatness problem. The flatness problem highlights the issue that a tiny difference in origin conditions would have generated a universe entirely different from the one we observe today. Now, I have always thought that this is no mystery, the fact that we are here to observe this universe is the reason we may puzzle about these finetuned conditions, but they are just one in many, equally possible, universes, and our surprise is therefore of our own making. I even thought this position was enlightened, and quite clever. But Brian explained that physicists abhor theories that rely on unknown qualities, on axiomatic pronouncements that accept something as a given. I understood that only by asking ""why"" were physicists able to develop a theory that explains the finetuning, and go beyond the Big Bang as the creation theory of the universe. And this was an excellent lesson to me. I think I knew this once, but I had forgotten about it. In my case, my anthropic stance was actually an attempt on my part to avoid a deeper question, an attempt to posit an answer where there wasn't one yet. Brian reminded me that we must never stop asking ""why"", that asking ""why"" is what makes us human. I loved this book. I can only recommend it to anybody who does not have a formal degree in science and wants to learn more about cosmology but is a bit frustrated about the lack of depth popular accounts of this topic typically provide."

Greene avoids both. This is hands down the best popular intro to modern physics I've found. Even with half a B.S. in physics and formal courses on many of the topics covered, this book consistently kept my interest and taught me new things.Two unique aspects of this book I haven't found elsewhere are (1) its focus on space and time and (2) its enthusiasm. As for (1), most pop sci books on physics focus on trying to convey one or more specific theories (quantum theory, special relativity, string theory, etc) and may discuss space or time in the context of one of these theories but don't make connections between them. Greene actually makes space and time the main character of this story and follows them throughout history and across theories. As for (2), not since Richard Feynman have I found a physicist whose writing makes me shiver with childish delight at the wonders of the universe. Some might find his poetic geeky gushes cheesy, but others (like myself) will spend the next several evenings lying outside on their lawns, staring at the stars, and just basking in the awesomeness of it all.That said, don't expect a book without mathematics to convey a full picture of our current understanding of physics. Nature seems to be written most naturally in the language of mathematics and that is the language in which she must be read. Hopefully though, if you haven't gotten over a particularly frightening encounter with mathematics as a young impressionable child, this book will convince you that it's worth doing.If you:

   are interested in modern physics but don't know where to start 
   have read a few pop sci books or many pop sci articles but want to see how many of the ideas fit together 
   or curious about our past and current understanding of space and time
...then I highly recommend this book, regardless of your background."
194,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This was as very confounding book to me - not confusing but confounding. It has some amazing observations and conundrums to ponder over and I suspect I did not appreciate (or even understand all that it had to tell me).Let me explain - some of the chapters used examples - some of which I have actually studied in my years in education. For example the example where electrons can be treated as particles while at the same time be treated as waves. Now I remember the experiments and I remember the theory that went with them. But I did not associated them with the bigger picture being presented in the chapter. And so the reason why I am confounded- this book challenges many of the scientific notions, a few it takes and builds upon them often reinforcing the notions it is trying to convey. And yet reading this book I feel there is so much more to learn and understand (including some of the sections in the book itself). Ironically looking back at my education I realise that rather than trying to build a foundation for me to build upon I feel like it have been shown how little I know and how so much there is still to explore and learn.Books like this have a variety of effects on me - but this is the first to make me feel so small in the scheme of things. But rather than making it feel a negative experience its almost like a reassurance that you are part of everything and in the right place. As I have said earlier there is more to be learnt from this book - but for now I need let my mind rest as its had a bit of a work out reading these pages. "

We’re storytellers, and what could be more grand than the story of creation?” Admittedly, my head was spinning quite a bit during this read. After all, trying to understand quantum physics is something my brain just isn't wired to do.I love science, and even though volumes like this can be a task to get through, I am always left enlightened and amazed at the facts and philosophies of existence and all that it encompasses. This is not a book I would recommend if you are only wanting to be entertained, but I will say this; several times during this read I snapped out a stupor and realized I had been staring off into space, lost in those thoughts of time, space, and reality.

My only criticism is that Greene can't figure out who his audience is: there's an odd mix of esoterica and the mundane. Most of the esoteric stuff is banished to the footnotes, which are well worth reading--and I suppose I should be happy that it's there at all, since most books on modern science are written with Hawking's Editor's Law in mind: with each equation, your audience shrinks by 90%.

I guess at least now I am familiar enough with the concepts which confuse me to be able to sound like I know something about general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory over beers with friends, and that's the important thing, right?Greene uses lots of pop cultural referenced examples to illustrate difficult mathematic/theoretical constructs, so familiarity with the Simpsons, X-Files, Star Trek and Star Wars may sometimes have you thinking ""hey, I know what he's talking about"" even when you have no clue. I think some of it actually did sink in, so I'm going to recommend this to anyone who desires a primer on the advances in physics & cosmology since e=mc2 but doesn't want to read a bunch of equations."

I really enjoyed the many easy to understand explanations. Also, the book has a lot of material for the reader that even has an intermediate understanding of theoretical physics. So, it's great for a broader range of science buffs.The book covers many of the relevant theoretic physics theories. The books gives a great chronological history of physics itself.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Tkanje Svemira autora Brajana Grina / Heliks 2016 publishing / 592 pages / 159,214 words.Translation was well done."

After reading this book, you'll always have unfinished business in discovering more and more about the universe. This book is a very good intro to physics and discovering about the universe."
201,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951046-john,4,"Lots of really interesting things in this book. I didn't realize physics had progressed so far in finding a unification theory.What I found most interesting would probably horrify the author because, while he didn't say so in so many words, he apparently really believes that physics is, or can be, the answer to everything. I, on the other hand, believe there is a God, the Christian God, who has a hand in our existence.I have always thought it curious that descriptions of God or angels appearing to people seem to be accompanied by bright light and that the supernatural being just appears out of nowhere. Upon reflection this seemed to me very much like them coming out of another dimension. So, what to my surprise, some of the current notions coming out of physics is that reality consists of more dimensions than we currently are able to experience. Score one for angels appearing out of nowhere because they can move from another dimension into our 3-dimensional existence.Then there's the issue of God being omniscient, i.e. knowing everything, past, present, and future. OK, He's God, so I suppose he can know all that, but it seems kind of difficult to figure how He can know the future when it hasn't happened yet. So, what to my surprise again, I learn that physics suggests that space and time are not independent but should be considered spacetime. And (from page 452) ""that moments--the events making up the spacetime loaf--just are. They are timeless. Each moment--each event or happening--exists, just as each point in space exists."" So it appears that someone, God, for instance, who has extent in another dimension outside our spacetime, could presumably see all of our spacetime, past, present, and future. Wow!Now what about free will or agency? Christians believe that people can choose to do good or do evil and are therefore responsible for the consequences. On the other hand (from page 455), ""The laws of classical physics are deterministic. ...if you were to know precisely how things are now (the position and velocity of every particle in the universe), the laws of classical physics would tell you exactly how things were are would be at any other moment you specified. The equations are indifferent to the supposed freedom of human will."" So, according to classical physics, there is no such thing as agency or free will. But then along comes quantum theory and one view is (from page 456), ""...if the passage from probabilities to definite outcomes requires something beyond the standard quantum framework--it's at least possible that free will might find a concrete realization within physical law. We might one day find, as some physicists has speculated, that the act of conscious observation is an integral element of quantum mechanics, being the catalyst that coaxes one outcome from the quantum haze to be realized."" Greene goes on to say, ""Personally, I find this extremely unlikely, but I know of no way to rule it out."" He doesn't like it, but he has the honesty to admit that it's a possibility.Those who have faith that God exists don't, or shouldn't, need science to back Him up. But I've got to admit that it is nice when it does. Of course, as Greene points out, much of what physics proposes is theory that has not been experimentally verified. Some of the above may be supplanted in the future by other theories, but for the time being it is interesting that science seems to verify some of the attributes of God as understood by Christians."
202,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Once again, as in ""The Elegant Universe,"" Greene has done an exemplary job of presenting a ""popular"" explication of deep science (particle physics and cosmology) that is neither condescending nor watered down. I've been amazed both times than anyone could pull this off, since it's been attempted so often but left the subjects either impenetrable or eviscerated.Greene's salient attribute is clarity: He can find and present the basic contours of just about any scientific discipline in clear, disciplined, open outline. He employs several simple, elementary approaches to make this happen.• short, direct, declarative sentences: Beautiful writing with little waste.• analogy: His use of analogy to elucidate arcane concepts is spot on even when (especially when) the comparison seems initially off the wall. I can't, in any way, overestimate the worth of this ability. (Bertrand Russell made a hash of explaining relativity with a raft of confounding, muddying analogies.)• repetition: Greene presents an idea and its details from several different but complementary directions that both reinforce the underlying principles and keep them continually in mind. And he doesn't assume that once he's outlined a concept, you will automatically recall its ramifications three days later. Instead, when he refers to it again, he summarizes it quickly, as if reminding a friend walking with him down a forest path. • basic fairness: Greene has his biases (mostly in favor of string theory and its near relatives), which he never denies. But he gives full credit to the other theorists down the block, admits the failings of the theories he loves and the positive side of the others.• combining inside-outside views: Any enterprise can create a corporate worldview where what you're doing assumes a centrality that the rest of humanity might consider either scary or amusing. Greene is an insider, to different degrees, in the enterprises of mathematics, physics and string theory. Yet he does a pretty complete job of balancing the committed insider against the (more) objective outsider. He speaks equally well for himself, for the wider theoretical community, and to you, looking through the window. Greene's writing and willingness to share himself have grown since ""The Elegant Universe."" It shows most in his humor. He kept it under tight rein in the first work, but here it wanders out to laugh in the sun. ""The Simpsons"" in all their glory rollick throughout the book without apology, and the analogies often have a giggle in them that in no way limits their affect.Some of the elements I'd regretted being missed from ""The Elegant Universe"" are here in detail, in part because of the intervening half decade between publication, but I think more because that's what he's chosen here to add on. You've got dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs field (prior to the way-too-recent discovery of the Higgs boson), inflationary cosmology.I'm looking forward to reading his still more recent work."
203,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"Did Greene plagiarise a section of his book? More on that later.Oh, god, I'm surprised I finished it. For the most part, I enjoy theoretical physics. I'm not sure if I believe everything that theoretical physics proposes (but then again, I'm not one for blindly allowing myself to be pulled along by an entity I can't see), but I enjoy it nonetheless. And I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. Greene offers some thought provoking ideas, and he even mentions at one point the author of one of my favourite theoretical physics books,Lisa Randall. Unfortunately, Greene is unable to translate all his ideas into legible text. I was able to understand some of what he was saying, but after a while, my eyes started to glaze over and I was left puzzling my own existence. Greene tends to throw ideas out there (such as cracked eggs becoming whole again, or ice forming in a glass of warm water and then melting once more) without giving a warning, that leaves the reader wondering if perhaps Greene has lost his marbles in the search for truth. Furthermore, and this may be more a publisher's error, but the book promised discussion on black holes and the like- my favourite of all astronomical topics. However, black holes are only mentioned in depth in the last twenty odd pages. However, there was a chapter on time travel, wormholes and alternate universes, but that was only a short chapter in of itself.There was one segment I did catch that made me sit up and laugh. I only would have caught it because I read Flash Forward by Richard J. Sawyer shortly before this book. Greene and Sawyer both use the same analogy of Gone With the Wind as a way of describing looking through time, in exactly the same manner. Seeing as Sawyer wrote his novel first (back in 1999) and The Fabric of the Cosmos was written in 2004, I can only suspect that Greene was, er, inspired if you will to use it. Still, I'm sure Sawyer would appreciate the credit."
204,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Periodically I get inspired to read big science books aimed at clarifying things to laypeople without any maths. Generally, each time I get slightly further than I did the previous time before eventually losing focus and coasting to the end. This was one of those times. Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.Anyway. Some notes I took:The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!Maxwell/EinsteinMaxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.Quantum MechanicsLight tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.Part 2 - TimeTalks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.Quantum Mechanics + time.If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.CosmologyHubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of Back to the Future.Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. "
205,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"I wish I could say 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' is an easy read which makes clear a subject that only geniuses understand normally about what classic physics and quantum mechanics have to do with understanding the mysteries of cosmology, particularly the theories regarding what the universe is, how it began, what made it function the way it does and why there seems to be an arrow of Time. I can't. Physics is too hard for me. However, Brian Greene is a brilliant man with a teacher's magic talent of sussing out how to simplify and explain difficult complexities of scientific thought. His book 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' did not lose me until the final six chapters! Gentle reader, I highly recommend this book.Physics is not only about observations and experiments, it is mostly about interpreting horribly complicated maths. Fortunately, Brian Greene leaves the math for the 'Notes' section in the back of this book while describing through analogies and simple-as-possible, and logical, well-written historical vignettes about the key physics discoveries by famous physicists which illuminate the nature of space and time. Each step of increasing scientific knowledge important to cosmology is described in a logical procession of conclusions, facts and theories, chapter by chapter. I finally understood many much briefer and out-of-context explanations in science articles which I have occasionally read. (However, I think I will not remember much of this enlightenment in a few weeks, alas.)The newest theories and guesses, described in chapters 12-16, about three-branes and brane splats, extra dimensions, string theory holograms, super-symmetry particle spinning, potential energy bowls, free will (yes, I said free will), five-string theories, two 'Big Bang' theories, and loop quantum gravity, by these genius scientists are the hardest of all to understand by this ordinary mortal, gentle reader, but perseverance with 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' DID make a small collapse of probabilities in the jittering mass of my excited brain particles so that this cat was radiant with more intelligence upon exiting the ebook. Unfortunately, though, I have a feeling this enlightenment is but a moon's dim reflective glow, gone as soon as the sun rises."
206,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is a nice overview of modern physics, including implications of relativity (specific and general), quantum mechanics and string theory, together with a discussion of the implications for cosmology. Some of the interesting items discussed here include the notion that during the ""Planck time"", ie, 10^(-34) sec or so after the Big Bang, space and time had no meaning, that our 3-D universe may be only an illusion of an underlying 11-dimensional universe, and reality may be coded in a cosmic ""hologram"", and that our universe may be only a minor dot in an incomparably vaster ""multiverse"".My own objection to this book is that most of this material has been written elsewhere -- for starters, Greene's earlier book ""The Elegant Universe"" was an excellent introduction to string theory and its implications. That's a problem with writing a great book -- it's hard to match the same level of excitement in the next book.The other criticism that one might raise is that string theory and the multiverse, in particular, remain highly controversial in the field. Indeed, some scientists (such as Lee Smolin) are saying out loud that string theory has been given too much rope for too long, and it is time to face the reality that it has not produced any crisp, testable hypotheses (nor is it likely to for a while). For the same reasons, many are opposed to the notion of the ""multiverse"", not just for technical reasons but also for philosophical reasons -- how can the hypothesis of an infinity of companion universes, whose existence can only be indirectly suggested, even in principle, qualify as empirical science?"
207,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel,5,"The book focused mainly on the concepts of space and time, and how they build the universe around us. Starting with the concept of space and how that's changed over the years, then time and how that's changed and now the concept of spacetime, and then the universe itself. A large part of the book was used trying to explain, ""time's arrow"" why things go forward but never backwards, why entropy is always greater in the future and never the past. It was all very interesting. At times I did get a bit lost, though not that often, but I feel now I have a much better understanding of a lot of modern physics concepts and ideas, for example I know understand Pbranes user name! I never really understood the big bang, that the universe was expanding, not that things were just getting flung further out into space. I think inflationary cosmology is neat. (even if it doesn't tie everything together). The chapter I enjoyed the most I think had to be looking at the teleportation and possibilities of time travel in the future. It was definitely more on the what if end of physics, but it was very interesting and I really enjoyed his explanations for why there would be no paradox. But it's definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in learning how the universe might work, and how in a lot of ways it does. It made a nice change for me to read a book about a subject I know so little about. While I cannot therefore give an expert opinion about it's accuracy, it was fascinating and I feel like I understand the world a lot more now."

This book carefully lays out the most famous experiments that form the foundation of quantum mechanics and explains the results in plain words. A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."

The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
225,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader. "

235,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
236,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

237,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
238,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."
239,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642545-michael,0," If there is one subject I struggle with, it's the hard sciences. But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

This book carefully lays out the most famous experiments that form the foundation of quantum mechanics and explains the results in plain words. A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

252,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."

The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
255,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader. "

265,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
266,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

267,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
268,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."
269,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642545-michael,0," If there is one subject I struggle with, it's the hard sciences. But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

This book carefully lays out the most famous experiments that form the foundation of quantum mechanics and explains the results in plain words. A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

282,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."

The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
285,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader.

295,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
296,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

297,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
298,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."

But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

This book carefully lays out the most famous experiments that form the foundation of quantum mechanics and explains the results in plain words. A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

312,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."

The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
315,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader.

It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
326,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

327,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
328,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."

But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

This book carefully lays out the most famous experiments that form the foundation of quantum mechanics and explains the results in plain words. A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

342,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."

The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
345,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader.

It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
356,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

357,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
358,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."

But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

This book carefully lays out the most famous experiments that form the foundation of quantum mechanics and explains the results in plain words. A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

372,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."

The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
375,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader.

It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories.

Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."

I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

387,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
388,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."
389,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642545-michael,0," If there is one subject I struggle with, it's the hard sciences. But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "
390,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1892148-sandra,5,"Author Brian Green is to be commended for his brilliant attempt to communicate the intricacies of particle physics, general and special relativity, the Big Bang, quantum mechanics and, yes--even string theory--to the interested lay person. It is a monumental effort ,since these topics are not easy for most people to grasp. I know because I have a genuine interest and have read numerous books purporting to make these theories understandable. This is the first one that I almost, nearly--at least sometimes almost nearly--got. And since the book contains an excellent glossary of terms I will at least now be able to sprinkle my conversation with some daunting verbiage--always a good thing.I did not find all the included graphics helpful, but a few were enormously helpful. I now have a much firmer grasp of what is meant by extra dimensions (never easy to visualize) and I was blown away by the thought that the universe probably resembles a Pringles potato chip, when I had always just assumed it must be balloon-like. Who would have thought.I think that if I read this book two or three more times, I might actually become an educated person. That’s unlikely, but at least there’s that great glossary."
391,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,5,"Referencing Camus’ ultimate philosophical statement that the only question worth considering is suicide, Brian Green states at the beginning of this book that the ultimate question is really, “What is space?” and takes some 500+ pages to trace the chase for an answer. He nailed the question, but never came to a definitive answer—because there isn’t one. But he did an incredible job of discussing it, taking a hack like myself through the paces of Newtonian physics, Einstein’s theories of relativity, the bizarre world of quantum mechanics, and into string theory. This massive amount of astoundingly complex information was explained about as well as anyone has ever explained it to me (I've read several attempts), and with some levity. It took me over a year to read this, because I had to reread several sections several times, along with some time to let it seep into my head (to the extent possible) before moving on to the next section. And I plan to reread it again sometime in the future. It’s like a reference book. "
392,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32722-erica,4,"Physics is such a strange science, and yet, it's also the most elemental. The wild theories these folks come up with are mind-bending, almost whimsical. But are mathmaticians the only ones who have a claim on reality? There seems to be a strain of hubris running through the book - if we keep running more and more experiments and solving more complex math problems, we'll have all the answers. One YouTube video description refers to Greene as an ""evangelist"" and it's difficult to argue with that characterization as he gesticulates from his ""pulpit"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu-_Pv...).Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book. It was well-written, it caused a great shift in my perspective on everyday live (I now imagine myself moving through a ""space-time loaf"" as I pull laundry out of the dryer), and it brought me into the debates of a science that might otherwise remain beyond even my faint grasp."
393,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,5,"Greene writes beautifully about astrophysics and particle physics, bringing the two fields together as he describe how scientists have struggled to explain both with a single theory. His specialty is string theory which he introduces in this book. I started reading this book earlier and stopped as it took greater concentration than I could provide. Having completed it, I would do better reading it again. However, it is a few years old and, therefore, does not provide the latest discoveries. He talks of the Higgs Boson but it had not yet been identified. The Higgs field is critical to considering space. Scientists were quite certain of its existence but needed more evidence.Books get old very fast in physics but some have sufficient clarity to help maintain their usefulness. This is one of them."
394,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39041422-andrew-escobedo,5,"This is was such a fantastic and deeply interesting book. Brian Greene is able to write and convey these extremely technical and complex ideas into something that the general reader can digest. The book is written in such a way in that you can feel Green's child like curiosity and excitement. The book spans from understanding Einsteins Theory of special, then to general relativity, and eases you into quantum mechanics, sinking into string theory, and going into m-theory, and understanding super symmetry, ultimately leading to the question and theorized ideas of what is space, what is time? It's a tremendous explanation and one that gives you a deep appreciation for all of the intense work through the centuries that so many of the greatest minds have spent so much time on in order to understand ourselves and our place in the universe, and how far we have come since these early times.

This book is very long and very in depth and NOT easy to get through. Despite that, I REALLY enjoyed it. I learned so much about things that I didn't even know existed. If you asked me what the Higgs field was before reading this, I would have an answer. I didn't have a concrete understanding of general relativity before this book. So this book does what I think it promised to do: teach me. The way Greene explains such difficult to wrap your head around concepts is great and filled with a lot of funny examples. My only issue, as I may have mentioned earlier, is that the book definitely shouldn't be read (almost CAN'T be read) in a short amount of time. The concepts are very complicated and they need time to sink in. Keep that in mind; it's not a quick read! "
396,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,4,"Dr. Greene wrote something called The Elegant Universe, which I have not yet read, but after reading The Fabric of the Cosmos, I definitely will. In this book, he explains the complex ideas behind and hypotheses of string theory, and of the research that involves the very fabric of space and time. I did not need to recall too much from my physics classes in college because this is mostly written at a layman's level, and he is an engaging writer. In fact, the very complex research going on today at places all over the world attempting to discover the fundamental makeup of the universe is written about and explained as though Dr. Greene is writing for an audience unfamiliar with college level science. Not only does Greene makes this intensely complex subject matter understandable, he makes it fun to read. Highly recommend!"

Well written, smooth, with the occasional entertaining anecdote.The basic question it tries to solve is why time has a direction, whereas there is nothing in physics which seems to dictate that.

I can understand most of the concepts and ideas, I just cannot envision many of them. Still, the little I have been able to absorb has really given me a completly different perspective on our existence and on the world around me, both of the vast and the miniscule.

It took me over a year to read, because I re-read many passages, and spent a lot of time thinking about the concepts, to ensure that I understood everything as well as I possibly could.

The best part of the book, though, goes well beyond the basics to vivid explorations of the most profoundly weird - and exciting - ideas about the essential nature of the universe. "

It's a really amazing thing to be able to articulate such technical and/or bizarre (to common sense) concepts in such a way that normal people can understand the implications of complex math without having to look at math.

The questions that modern physics strives to answer fascinate me and I believe that these are the most crucial endeavors of our times.Space and time are difficult concepts to define, yet Greene as a good professor that he is has tried to do just that. Space can be explained by the inflationary theory as shown by the discovery of the cosmic background radiation. And it looks as if time is an inherent concept of space which makes ""spacetime"" the continuum that dominates our reality."

However, it is missing a sense of wonder that fills the best books on science. It reads more like a textbook.There is one exception to the problems in this book, which is why it gets 4 stars. There is a chapter about time in the beginning of the book that made my head spin. It did have a sense of wonder and messed with my head, in a good way. I definitely recommend reading that section.

These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

432,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."
434,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47273055-rishav-mukherji,4,"This book is really long and by the end it's hard to keep track of all the scientific progress that has happened over the centuries. The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
435,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader. "
436,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3872950-carla,0,"Greene is a wonderful science writer, and he has a gift for choosing the perfect metaphor or anecdote to illustrate complex ideas.

I wish more time were spent on the competing theories to string theory, but a minor quibble. "

445,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
446,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

447,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
448,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."
449,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642545-michael,0," If there is one subject I struggle with, it's the hard sciences. But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

462,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."
464,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47273055-rishav-mukherji,4,"This book is really long and by the end it's hard to keep track of all the scientific progress that has happened over the centuries. The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
465,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader. "
466,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3872950-carla,0,"Greene is a wonderful science writer, and he has a gift for choosing the perfect metaphor or anecdote to illustrate complex ideas.

I wish more time were spent on the competing theories to string theory, but a minor quibble. "

475,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
476,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

477,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
478,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."

But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

492,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."
494,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47273055-rishav-mukherji,4,"This book is really long and by the end it's hard to keep track of all the scientific progress that has happened over the centuries. The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
495,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader. "
496,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3872950-carla,0,"Greene is a wonderful science writer, and he has a gift for choosing the perfect metaphor or anecdote to illustrate complex ideas.

I wish more time were spent on the competing theories to string theory, but a minor quibble. "

505,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
506,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

507,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
508,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."
509,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642545-michael,0," If there is one subject I struggle with, it's the hard sciences. But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

522,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."
524,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47273055-rishav-mukherji,4,"This book is really long and by the end it's hard to keep track of all the scientific progress that has happened over the centuries. The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
525,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader. "
526,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3872950-carla,0,"Greene is a wonderful science writer, and he has a gift for choosing the perfect metaphor or anecdote to illustrate complex ideas.

I wish more time were spent on the competing theories to string theory, but a minor quibble. "

535,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
536,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

537,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
538,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."
539,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642545-michael,0," If there is one subject I struggle with, it's the hard sciences. But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "

A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."

The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
555,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader. "
556,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3872950-carla,0,"Greene is a wonderful science writer, and he has a gift for choosing the perfect metaphor or anecdote to illustrate complex ideas.

565,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
566,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

567,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
568,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."
569,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642545-michael,0," If there is one subject I struggle with, it's the hard sciences. But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "
570,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1892148-sandra,5,"Author Brian Green is to be commended for his brilliant attempt to communicate the intricacies of particle physics, general and special relativity, the Big Bang, quantum mechanics and, yes--even string theory--to the interested lay person. It is a monumental effort ,since these topics are not easy for most people to grasp. I know because I have a genuine interest and have read numerous books purporting to make these theories understandable. This is the first one that I almost, nearly--at least sometimes almost nearly--got. And since the book contains an excellent glossary of terms I will at least now be able to sprinkle my conversation with some daunting verbiage--always a good thing.I did not find all the included graphics helpful, but a few were enormously helpful. I now have a much firmer grasp of what is meant by extra dimensions (never easy to visualize) and I was blown away by the thought that the universe probably resembles a Pringles potato chip, when I had always just assumed it must be balloon-like. Who would have thought.I think that if I read this book two or three more times, I might actually become an educated person. That’s unlikely, but at least there’s that great glossary."

He nailed the question, but never came to a definitive answer—because there isn’t one. But he did an incredible job of discussing it, taking a hack like myself through the paces of Newtonian physics, Einstein’s theories of relativity, the bizarre world of quantum mechanics, and into string theory. This massive amount of astoundingly complex information was explained about as well as anyone has ever explained it to me (I've read several attempts), and with some levity. It took me over a year to read this, because I had to reread several sections several times, along with some time to let it seep into my head (to the extent possible) before moving on to the next section.

The wild theories these folks come up with are mind-bending, almost whimsical. But are mathmaticians the only ones who have a claim on reality? There seems to be a strain of hubris running through the book - if we keep running more and more experiments and solving more complex math problems, we'll have all the answers.

Brian Greene is able to write and convey these extremely technical and complex ideas into something that the general reader can digest. The book is written in such a way in that you can feel Green's child like curiosity and excitement. The book spans from understanding Einsteins Theory of special, then to general relativity, and eases you into quantum mechanics, sinking into string theory, and going into m-theory, and understanding super symmetry, ultimately leading to the question and theorized ideas of what is space, what is time? It's a tremendous explanation and one that gives you a deep appreciation for all of the intense work through the centuries that so many of the greatest minds have spent so much time on in order to understand ourselves and our place in the universe, and how far we have come since these early times.

So this book does what I think it promised to do: teach me. The way Greene explains such difficult to wrap your head around concepts is great and filled with a lot of funny examples. My only issue, as I may have mentioned earlier, is that the book definitely shouldn't be read (almost CAN'T be read) in a short amount of time.

Space can be explained by the inflationary theory as shown by the discovery of the cosmic background radiation.

It is a monumental effort ,since these topics are not easy for most people to grasp. I know because I have a genuine interest and have read numerous books purporting to make these theories understandable. This is the first one that I almost, nearly--at least sometimes almost nearly--got. And since the book contains an excellent glossary of terms I will at least now be able to sprinkle my conversation with some daunting verbiage--always a good thing.I did not find all the included graphics helpful, but a few were enormously helpful. I now have a much firmer grasp of what is meant by extra dimensions (never easy to visualize) and I was blown away by the thought that the universe probably resembles a Pringles potato chip, when I had always just assumed it must be balloon-like. Who would have thought.I think that if I read this book two or three more times, I might actually become an educated person. That’s unlikely, but at least there’s that great glossary."

He nailed the question, but never came to a definitive answer—because there isn’t one. But he did an incredible job of discussing it, taking a hack like myself through the paces of Newtonian physics, Einstein’s theories of relativity, the bizarre world of quantum mechanics, and into string theory. This massive amount of astoundingly complex information was explained about as well as anyone has ever explained it to me (I've read several attempts), and with some levity. It took me over a year to read this, because I had to reread several sections several times, along with some time to let it seep into my head (to the extent possible) before moving on to the next section.

Brian Greene is able to write and convey these extremely technical and complex ideas into something that the general reader can digest. The book is written in such a way in that you can feel Green's child like curiosity and excitement. The book spans from understanding Einsteins Theory of special, then to general relativity, and eases you into quantum mechanics, sinking into string theory, and going into m-theory, and understanding super symmetry, ultimately leading to the question and theorized ideas of what is space, what is time? It's a tremendous explanation and one that gives you a deep appreciation for all of the intense work through the centuries that so many of the greatest minds have spent so much time on in order to understand ourselves and our place in the universe, and how far we have come since these early times.

This book is very long and very in depth and NOT easy to get through. Despite that, I REALLY enjoyed it. I learned so much about things that I didn't even know existed. If you asked me what the Higgs field was before reading this, I would have an answer. I didn't have a concrete understanding of general relativity before this book. So this book does what I think it promised to do: teach me. The way Greene explains such difficult to wrap your head around concepts is great and filled with a lot of funny examples. My only issue, as I may have mentioned earlier, is that the book definitely shouldn't be read (almost CAN'T be read) in a short amount of time. The concepts are very complicated and they need time to sink in. Keep that in mind; it's not a quick read! "

In this book, he explains the complex ideas behind and hypotheses of string theory, and of the research that involves the very fabric of space and time. I did not need to recall too much from my physics classes in college because this is mostly written at a layman's level, and he is an engaging writer. In fact, the very complex research going on today at places all over the world attempting to discover the fundamental makeup of the universe is written about and explained as though Dr. Greene is writing for an audience unfamiliar with college level science. Not only does Greene makes this intensely complex subject matter understandable, he makes it fun to read. Highly recommend!"

Well written, smooth, with the occasional entertaining anecdote.The basic question it tries to solve is why time has a direction, whereas there is nothing in physics which seems to dictate that.

(the simpsons do mercifully go away after a few chapters, although mulder and scully then make an appearance to try to compensate for what they must take to be leftover seriousness. the rest of the book then boasts what must be two of the most bizarre images ever set down in science writing: «what would happen if you were to drop a frog into a hot metal bowl with a pile of worms lying in the center»; «think of a huge but flexible box filled with many thousands of swarming children, incessantly running and jumping». whether these make a plus or a minus is up for you to decide, no disclosure needed.)"

Brian Greene is able to write and convey these extremely technical and complex ideas into something that the general reader can digest. The book is written in such a way in that you can feel Green's child like curiosity and excitement. The book spans from understanding Einsteins Theory of special, then to general relativity, and eases you into quantum mechanics, sinking into string theory, and going into m-theory, and understanding super symmetry, ultimately leading to the question and theorized ideas of what is space, what is time? It's a tremendous explanation and one that gives you a deep appreciation for all of the intense work through the centuries that so many of the greatest minds have spent so much time on in order to understand ourselves and our place in the universe, and how far we have come since these early times.

If you asked me what the Higgs field was before reading this, I would have an answer. I didn't have a concrete understanding of general relativity before this book. So this book does what I think it promised to do: teach me. The way Greene explains such difficult to wrap your head around concepts is great and filled with a lot of funny examples. My only issue, as I may have mentioned earlier, is that the book definitely shouldn't be read (almost CAN'T be read) in a short amount of time.

In fact, the very complex research going on today at places all over the world attempting to discover the fundamental makeup of the universe is written about and explained as though Dr. Greene is writing for an audience unfamiliar with college level science.

690,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1892148-sandra,5,"Author Brian Green is to be commended for his brilliant attempt to communicate the intricacies of particle physics, general and special relativity, the Big Bang, quantum mechanics and, yes--even string theory--to the interested lay person. It is a monumental effort ,since these topics are not easy for most people to grasp. I know because I have a genuine interest and have read numerous books purporting to make these theories understandable. This is the first one that I almost, nearly--at least sometimes almost nearly--got. And since the book contains an excellent glossary of terms I will at least now be able to sprinkle my conversation with some daunting verbiage--always a good thing.I did not find all the included graphics helpful, but a few were enormously helpful. I now have a much firmer grasp of what is meant by extra dimensions (never easy to visualize) and I was blown away by the thought that the universe probably resembles a Pringles potato chip, when I had always just assumed it must be balloon-like. Who would have thought.I think that if I read this book two or three more times, I might actually become an educated person. That’s unlikely, but at least there’s that great glossary."

He nailed the question, but never came to a definitive answer—because there isn’t one. But he did an incredible job of discussing it, taking a hack like myself through the paces of Newtonian physics, Einstein’s theories of relativity, the bizarre world of quantum mechanics, and into string theory. This massive amount of astoundingly complex information was explained about as well as anyone has ever explained it to me (I've read several attempts), and with some levity. It took me over a year to read this, because I had to reread several sections several times, along with some time to let it seep into my head (to the extent possible) before moving on to the next section.

The wild theories these folks come up with are mind-bending, almost whimsical. But are mathmaticians the only ones who have a claim on reality? There seems to be a strain of hubris running through the book - if we keep running more and more experiments and solving more complex math problems, we'll have all the answers. One YouTube video description refers to Greene as an ""evangelist"" and it's difficult to argue with that characterization as he gesticulates from his ""pulpit"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu-_Pv...).Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book. It was well-written, it caused a great shift in my perspective on everyday live (I now imagine myself moving through a ""space-time loaf"" as I pull laundry out of the dryer), and it brought me into the debates of a science that might otherwise remain beyond even my faint grasp."

If you asked me what the Higgs field was before reading this, I would have an answer. I didn't have a concrete understanding of general relativity before this book. So this book does what I think it promised to do: teach me. The way Greene explains such difficult to wrap your head around concepts is great and filled with a lot of funny examples. My only issue, as I may have mentioned earlier, is that the book definitely shouldn't be read (almost CAN'T be read) in a short amount of time.

In this book, he explains the complex ideas behind and hypotheses of string theory, and of the research that involves the very fabric of space and time. I did not need to recall too much from my physics classes in college because this is mostly written at a layman's level, and he is an engaging writer. In fact, the very complex research going on today at places all over the world attempting to discover the fundamental makeup of the universe is written about and explained as though Dr. Greene is writing for an audience unfamiliar with college level science.

Well written, smooth, with the occasional entertaining anecdote.The basic question it tries to solve is why time has a direction, whereas there is nothing in physics which seems to dictate that.

This book is very long and very in depth and NOT easy to get through. Despite that, I REALLY enjoyed it. I learned so much about things that I didn't even know existed. If you asked me what the Higgs field was before reading this, I would have an answer. I didn't have a concrete understanding of general relativity before this book. So this book does what I think it promised to do: teach me. The way Greene explains such difficult to wrap your head around concepts is great and filled with a lot of funny examples. My only issue, as I may have mentioned earlier, is that the book definitely shouldn't be read (almost CAN'T be read) in a short amount of time. The concepts are very complicated and they need time to sink in. Keep that in mind; it's not a quick read! "
756,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,4,"Dr. Greene wrote something called The Elegant Universe, which I have not yet read, but after reading The Fabric of the Cosmos, I definitely will. In this book, he explains the complex ideas behind and hypotheses of string theory, and of the research that involves the very fabric of space and time. I did not need to recall too much from my physics classes in college because this is mostly written at a layman's level, and he is an engaging writer. In fact, the very complex research going on today at places all over the world attempting to discover the fundamental makeup of the universe is written about and explained as though Dr. Greene is writing for an audience unfamiliar with college level science. Not only does Greene makes this intensely complex subject matter understandable, he makes it fun to read. Highly recommend!"

You don't need previous knowledge to read this book, but it isn't an easy read. There's not a lot of math or formulas, but you do need your brain to handle all the dense information. Well written, smooth, with the occasional entertaining anecdote.The basic question it tries to solve is why time has a direction, whereas there is nothing in physics which seems to dictate that. Using that angle, the entire history of the field passes through the book's 500 plus pages. More non-fiction recommendations & SFF reviews on Weiging A Pig..."
758,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837711-chaos,0,"took me three tries to get going with this – all those examples built around simpsons mythos put me off hard – but it turned out to be a good and entertaining overview of contemporary physics, if often indeed superficial to the point of incomprehensibility. (the simpsons do mercifully go away after a few chapters, although mulder and scully then make an appearance to try to compensate for what they must take to be leftover seriousness. the rest of the book then boasts what must be two of the most bizarre images ever set down in science writing: «what would happen if you were to drop a frog into a hot metal bowl with a pile of worms lying in the center»; «think of a huge but flexible box filled with many thousands of swarming children, incessantly running and jumping». whether these make a plus or a minus is up for you to decide, no disclosure needed.)"
759,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/774944-art,5,"God, where should I start. I was first turned on to this book by Kat. Her brain is much more powerful than mine, so I am now reading it again to try and get my thoughts around a little more of it. It is an excellent book; however, I just lack the background knowledge to fully understand a lot of it. Perhaps I should say, to understand it at any applicable level. I can understand most of the concepts and ideas, I just cannot envision many of them. Still, the little I have been able to absorb has really given me a completly different perspective on our existence and on the world around me, both of the vast and the miniscule. Can't wait until the Hadron Collider is up and running. What will we learn from there in the next few years?"
760,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1157039-michael,5,"Fascinating, but slow-going, mainly because I'm a nincompoop when it comes to anything math-related. It's my curse, I guess...to be endlessly fascinated with physics and quantum mechanics, but never being about to grasp the math. Mr. Greene does a good job of explaining his and others' theories for the lay person like me, but he also includes detailed notes for the mathematically inclined. It took me over a year to read, because I re-read many passages, and spent a lot of time thinking about the concepts, to ensure that I understood everything as well as I possibly could. Recommended to all you science-lovers out there. Even if you struggle with basic algebra, like me, you'll find a lot of interesting things in this book."
761,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5539910-abdullah-diab,5,"A great book, starts small and easy, and delves into the most amazing details of the universe, it answered too many questions I had.I could clearly see the perfection in the details of the universe, read about the many viewpoints of its creation and composition, it was an amazing journey, it left me more certain of the existence of God, the circumstances to create such a highly tuned universe cannot be a coincidence.I enjoyed every single page of this book, the author is highly talented and knows how to explain things in a way that won't bore you while still full of details.Highly recommended to people interested in knowing more about the universe.I'm now searching for another book that would cover the gap between 2003 and 2016, would love some recommendations..."
762,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104765258-david,5,"You should have read some primer books before reading this one. Although, this book was the best-selling science book on Amazon in 2005. The topics are quite complex. What is reality? What is Spacetime? What are probability waves? Does time flow? Does time have an arrow? What is the shape of space? Are we close to understanding Grand Unification? What is inflation? What is the cosmological constant? What is dark matter and dark energy? What is string theory? What is supersymmetry? Can we travel through spacetime? What is the fabric of the Universe?Brian Greene has a friendly way of explaining all of this!"
763,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/457458-gregory,4,"Difficult. Slow-going. Have to digest in parts. Ultimately accessible, however. I have to confess that I'd never understood some of the most basic and exciting ideas of modern physics until this book...e.g., the relationship between time and speed; general / special relativity. Now at least I've got the basics. The best part of the book, though, goes well beyond the basics to vivid explorations of the most profoundly weird - and exciting - ideas about the essential nature of the universe. "
764,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,4," Of the half-dozen or so books I've read on a similar subject matter this one delves just that bit deeper,and seems to be a more thorough work incorporating the historical underpinnings of space-time theory.At times I found I needed to re-read to get to grips with it especially the section on time slices,which was a new theory for me,but on the whole I found it understandable by my modest intellect.It is well presented and written with some good illustrations and allegorical descriptions that make it generally easier to comprehend. "
765,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16891313-marin,5,"Written with great enthusiasm and no trace of condescendence towards lay readers.I was thrilled by the journey and I felt compelled to read carefully every word. OK, I struggled to follow some parts, despite reading some chapters twice but I feel it was due to my limitations.Great orator and teacher - I felt like being back at school (I must confess - I was geeky back then) - he helped me understand better some physics concepts.Is not the first book I read about the understanding of the works of the Universe, but it was one of the best."
766,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4954129-bethany,5,"So good! I'm a big fan of Greene by now. It's a really amazing thing to be able to articulate such technical and/or bizarre (to common sense) concepts in such a way that normal people can understand the implications of complex math without having to look at math. My favorite part of this book is his explanation of time - the past is not gone from the universe, and the future exists also - all times are now...because Chewbacca, on his planet far, far away, is observing us in the distant past or the distant future."
767,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"I have read quite a few books on physics lately, and it made me wonder why did I not become a physicist. The questions that modern physics strives to answer fascinate me and I believe that these are the most crucial endeavors of our times.Space and time are difficult concepts to define, yet Greene as a good professor that he is has tried to do just that. Space can be explained by the inflationary theory as shown by the discovery of the cosmic background radiation. And it looks as if time is an inherent concept of space which makes ""spacetime"" the continuum that dominates our reality."
768,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10144333-michele,4,"This book covers a lot of ground in contemporary physics. If you want to learn about these topics I recommend it. However, it is missing a sense of wonder that fills the best books on science. It reads more like a textbook.There is one exception to the problems in this book, which is why it gets 4 stars. There is a chapter about time in the beginning of the book that made my head spin. It did have a sense of wonder and messed with my head, in a good way. I definitely recommend reading that section. I also recommend Greene's Nova videos on youtube, especially the one on Time."
769,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5980451-alan-vonlanthen,4,"Who would use Bart Simpson's skateboard as a metaphoric support for General Relativity and Wormholes or weird dialogs between Mulder and Scully to demonstrate quantum fluctuation? Brian Green is a brilliant popularizer, he truly makes incredibly complex concepts seem easy to grasp and understand. This being said, I will have to re-read bits about quantum entanglement and teleportation ;)Definitely worth reading and even taking on a desert island!"
770,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/244982-don,5,"This is not a book, this is a hundred years of physics and science distilled into words. This book moved my brain from 1850s thinking to a 1950s understanding of the universe and a lot happened in that period. This simplified description of modern physics has incredible scope including the Higgs Ocean and the arrow of time. It hold the readers interest with (sometimes corny) metaphors. All the good stuff is in the first half. I stopped 2/3s in when string theory became too abstract."
771,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34632607-jared-davis,3,"nearly 15 years ago, this book (along with a slew of others in the science sections of Borders (RIP) and Half Price Books) inspired me to pursue math and physics. that pursuit led me to UChicago, and although I ultimately concentrated in philosophy, I went down a very particular path in life. Even though Greene's book isnt the greatest (and I dont think M-theory or string theory ever succeeded), you could say it changed my life. I guess thats all one should ask of a book"
772,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12195640-waki,4,"I admit that I skimmed a lot of the string theory parts because 1. I've read The Elegant Universe, 2. string theory isn't really my jam, and 3. I've accepted that I'm never going to be able to really understand string theory beyond what I already do. That aside, I found it an engaging, mostly well-articulated overview of modern physics/cosmology, and I particularly enjoyed the sections on entropy and the arrow of time. "
773,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5943200-andrew,4,"Man, this was the toughest read I've attempted since Gravity's Rainbow. At least I got to the end of this one.Despite all the zinging sounds of things going over my head, I believe I now have a tenuous grip on the basic premises of cutting edge physics (at least, as it stood in 2007)... which is quite an accomplishment,as Greene was needed to convey these concepts to someone who dropped out of Physics class in grade 9."
774,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300879-gina,0,I've barely made a dent in this book. The introduction is dry because the author has to give you the tools you need to understand what he explores in this book. I can't wait to get into the meat and potatoes of this book. I've always felt that time was not this finite linear concept but more like an onion with many layers.
775,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597781-jay,4,"If there's any accessibility to be found in modern theoretical physics, this is the old college try. Well written, involving, and leads to reckless amounts of navel gazing.Perfect for procrastinating because you feel smarter when you've finished a chunk, which feels more important than the dishes, the laundry, etc."
776,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12215616-koen,4,"I can recommend this book from Brian Greene if you are interested in the Fabric of the Cosmos. Shortly after this book, the Higgs particle was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider and the predictions described in this book are worth reading. Also the subject if Time has an arrow, was fascinating. "
777,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42561132-h-l,5,"The Fabric of the CosmosThis is an incredible book. The way Brian Greene talk about the universe is very scientific, attractive and evident. Also, Brian Greene is a very smart and imaginative. "
778,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42669310-jonathan-gnagy,4,Brian Greene explains some of the most difficult concepts in quantum physics and relativity in a way that anyone interested in learning these things can understand. The book made these difficult concepts fun and easy to visualize while still taking the reader from theories about the beginning and end of what we recognize as our universe. A very educational and fun read.
779,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26586138-r-a,4,My brain exploded! I've been toying with two speculative fiction ideas for the past couple months (today two has become three) and this week I really wanted to read some science books. This one is about reality. It was fascinating and mind-blowing. It also reminded me of philosophical discussions I've had with others.
