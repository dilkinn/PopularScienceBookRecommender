0,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Simon Singh has the ability to present a story about a mathematics problem, and tell it like a detective story. He makes the subject exciting, even though the outcome is well known. Singh intersperses history with discussions about the mathematics, and makes it quite understandable. Singh starts with the roots of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, by recounting the stories and mathematics of Pythagoras, Euclid, and Euler. Other, less well-known mathematicians are also given credit, for example Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin Cauchy, and Evariste Galois. Three hundred fifty years ago, Fermat wrote the following theorem in the margin of a mathematics book:  And, Fermat wrote that he had a marvelous proof, but no room in the margin for it. For centuries, mathematicians have attempted to prove the theorem, without success. It had been sort of a ""holy grail"" of mathematicians to prove the theorem, and many brilliant minds spent years on it. Perhaps in was unprovable, and worst of all, Kurt Godel showed that some theorems are actually undecidable--that is to say, it is impossible even to decide whether or not a theorem is true.Singh recounts a fascinating story of the gifted mathematician, Paul Wolfskehl. He was very depressed, and decided to commit suicide on a particular night, at midnight. While waiting for that time to arrive, he started to read about the failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He became so engrossed in the subject, that he worked well past midnight. He found a gap in the logic of a predecessor, and was so proud of himself that he gained a new desire for life. And, in his will he established a fund of 100,000 marks to be given to the mathematician who first completes the proof of the theorem!Much of the book describes how Andrew Wiles developed a growing interest in the theorem. He worked in almost total isolation for seven years, in order not to be distracted. He occasionally published little tidbits unrelated to his real endeavor, in order to dispel suspicions about what his real work entailed.The central piece of the proof entailed proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, that linked modular forms with elliptic equations. This was a linkage between two far-flung branches of mathematics that seemed to be totally unrelated. To prove the conjecture would allow incredible advances to be made. And then, Ken Ribet showed that a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would, in effect, be a direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But many people tried and failed to develop the proof. But that is exactly what Andrew Wiles worked on for so many years.I had previously read that during Andrew Wiles' famous lecture, he just casually let the unsuspecting audience know, ""and that is a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."" Well, this book tells a somewhat different story. Most of the audience had heard rumors that the third of Wiles' lectures would be of historical significance. They came prepared with cameras, and took photographs during the lecture. So, it was a surprise, but not a total surprise.After Wiles' manuscript of the proof was sent to a publisher, six mathematicians reviewed it, and a crucial gap was found in it. Wiles worked furiously for a nightmarish year, and with the help of Richard Taylor, finally closed the gap. Today, Wiles is recognized as the one who developed the proof. But it is clear, that Wiles ""stood on the shoulders of giants""; he used--and developed--mathematical techniques that had not existed just a few decades previously.Simon Singh writes with a wonderful style. It is clear, not too jargon-heavy but contains enough mathematical ""meat"" to seem satisfying. The book is followed by ten appendixes that contain more details about some of the mathematics; they are not overly technical, and give the reader a better understanding of some of the issues. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in math. "
1,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"Before delving into the book itself, I thought I’d start things off by introducing the problem it’s concerned with, just in case you aren’t already familiar with it.So, what exactly is Fermat’s Last Theorem? Well, basically, this is it: As you can see, the conjecture is quite easy to understand, and yet, believe it or not, it was so remarkably difficult to prove that it took over 350 years to accomplish! The fact that Fermat (teasingly?) scribbled this rather infuriating note in the margin only added to the frustration felt by the scores of mathematicians who did battle with it over the centuries: “I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.”No doubt the cheeky bastard would’ve enjoyed Twitter:Okay, now that that’s been taken care of, it’s time to look at the actual book.What Kind of Book is Fermat’s Enigma?Simply put, Fermat’s Enigma is a history book. It is most definitely NOT a math book, so don’t expect to find any degree of mathematical rigor or complexity here. There are a handful of fairly simple proofs included in the appendices, but overall, the concepts under discussion are glossed over in a superficial manner, never examined in any kind of detail. If you want something that fleshes out how the proof actually works, I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere. (Singh was kind enough to include quite a few “further reading suggestions” at the end of this book. While I’ve not looked into any of the titles he recommended, I assume many of those might prove more to your liking if you prefer a “math book” on the subject.)In any case, while Singh did not pursue the actual mathematics in any real sense, he did positively excel at telling the story of an utterly fascinating struggle, one which spanned hundreds of years and ensnared countless brilliant, talented minds. Readers make the acquaintance of such notable mathematicians as Pythagoras (whose work paved the way for Fermat), Leonhard Euler, Paul Wolfskehl, Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Evariste Galois, Yutaka Taniyama, Goro Shimura, and of course Andrew Wiles, the man, the myth, the legend who finally proved the damn thing. Overall, I was surprised and delighted by just how compelling the story actually was. For me, this book quickly became a veritable page-turner, one I was loathe to put aside. Some may argue that in order to accomplish this, he omitted too much relevant information, that he sacrificed depth for readability. Perhaps this is true to an extent, but in my opinion, while it was admittedly easy to read and follow, it still managed to include a fair amount of pertinent, interesting material. More importantly, it never got bogged down with unnecessary details or lost in minutiae, and never meandered down exasperating tangents, as many otherwise outstanding history books are wont to do. And ultimately, what made this book so very stimulating was that the manner in which the story was told really made it come alive. Singh bestowed a truly suspenseful, exciting quest upon the reader, one full of twists and turns, and even *gasp* its fair share of drama. He enthusiastically demonstrated just how action-packed and exhilarating the life of the mind can be. And for accomplishing this tremendous feat, I heartily recommend the book, warts and all.And Now, For a Few Words on the Star of the ShowAndrew Wiles is an extraordinary human being. Fascinated by Fermat’s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, he vowed to conquer that most impossible of proofs. This was at the age of ten, mind you. I seriously can’t get past that. And then, true to his word, the little rascal grew up to become an eminent mathematician, one who finally went into seclusion for seven years in order to hack away at this tremendous proof. While a not insignificant error marred the first release of said proof, he didn’t let that deter him, but persevered and managed to rectify the error, and, within a couple of years, came out with THE proof. Holy goddamn shit. To me, Wiles’ story was completely and utterly inspiring. I was frankly amazed by what the human mind can achieve; I think I will always be in awe of Wiles’ fierce determination and incredible tenacity. Mad respect. Anyway, as you can probably tell, Andrew Wiles is a personal hero of mine. He is an undeniable, ultimate badass. Wayne and Garth said it best:"
2,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64969574-barry-cunningham,5,"Being a scientist of long standing and loving all aspects of science and maths, Fermat's Last Theorem in itself was a wonderful mystery, what I would give to see Fermat's note book with a note in the margin about cubic numbers as opposed to squares. A very trite remark, too lengthy to write in the margin so it is elsewhere, and no one has ever found it or managed to prove his statement, until - - - this book is a brilliant read, you would think it would be as dry as dust, but no! It is a superb account of the proof of the last theorem from Fermat's notebook to be proven. The only thing that still niggles at me, although the mathematical proof is fabulous, it uses modern techniques not available to Fermat, so it is proven but how the hell did Fermat do it??????A brilliant book, beautifully written a tremendous historical question answered in a very modern way, fabulous, well done for readability."

Probably that's just because it's so bloody hard. I got a lot more though out of Prime Obsession, Derbyshire's book on the Riemann Hypothesis, where the author opens up the box and shows you some of the actual math..."
4,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Simon converts what could have been a dry chronicle of proofs into an ode full of excitement, inspiration and intrigue worthy of a gothic love affair. Full review to follow."
5,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This is the kind of book that we non mathematical minds can easily digest and love. It gives you an epic scope of the number of minds that it takes to build new ideas. I doubt if Fermat had actually solved this theorem correctly, but this is impossible to prove. Fermat's theorem however was not impossible to prove! It was solved! Thanks to the efforts of many men (and women!) over many lifetimes and one final man who had the determination and persistence to finish the unthinkable. This book has a lot of wonderful elements, and really exemplifies a love of mathematics. Although if you want to actually understand the theorem this book may not be for you! I can honestly say reading it did not put the theorem in any more digestible light than it started out with. Perhaps it was to the authors advantage to skip the technicalities and focus on the enjoyment of the journey. I personally loved this approach, but it may not be for everyone, especially if you are actually looking to understand the theorem (a massive undertaking that is really not in my repertoire to comment on). "
6,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"What a fun book this was (thanks, Trevor, for the recommendation)! There are many reasons I think I like (good) nonfiction -- a sense of direct relevance, gravitas, frequent insights into the workings of the universe (and people), but mostly for knowledge narcs -- high levels of information density served up into an intriguing package by someone else who has undertaken the heavy lifting (research, organization, thinking). So, here in Singh's work I get a solid lay understanding not only of the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem, but of much of mathematics (and the lives of mathematicians) since the seventeenth century.I've been thinking also about what attracts me to books on mathematical topics -- the works by Martin Gardner, William Poundstone, and the various other authors in the company of whose thoughts I've had pleasure to spend a week or more. What I've come away with, is that the best of them feed off surprises, those bits of counterintuitive anecdotes that leave you blurting out, ""Huh. How about that,"" and then looking madly around for someone to tell. Like a book of jokes, riddles, or puzzles that provides immediate gratification in the back of the book, Fermat's Enigma plugs at least ten conundrums (and their easy-to-understand, logical solutions) into its appendices. For example -- say you're unlucky enough to be forced into a three-way duel. If everyone gets to take turns in order of their skill such that worst shoots first, what should the worst do? Aim at the best in the hopes of getting lucky and eliminating the most dangerous gunsel? Nope, the correct answer is to pass up the turn in the hopes that your first shot will get to be expended against only one remaining combatant. That way, even if you miss, you at least had a chance to take aim at the only person able to shoot back.Pierre Fermat turns out to have been quite the prankster, often tweaking professional mathematicians and academics by mailing them problems they knew full well he had already solved. For those who don't keep this type of trivia at the forefront of their brains, Fermat's the French recluse (and hanging circuit jurist) who once famously scribbled in a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica that x^n + y^n ≠ z^n for any number n greater than 2, a propostion for which he had ""a truly marvelous demonstration… which this margin is too narrow to contain."" This gets to be Fermat's Last Theorem, simply because it ends up being the last of his conundrums to be proven (not necessarily the last one he wrote). Just think, were it not for the scrupulous care taken by Fermat's son to go through and publish all of Fermat, Sr.'s writings, the world would not have been tantalized by this particular gem for 
over 350 YEARS
.Andrew Wiles published the first (and only?) proof in 1994, and Enigma does a tremendous job of walking the reader through not only the stunning depth of his intellectual achievement, but its significance as well. Suffice it to say that I was happy here to read that Taniyama-Shimura get their well-earned due and that modular and elliptical equations can finally be understood to be mathematically analogous (whether or not I have any idea what modular equations actually are). Still, all of this leads to what I think is an even more tantalizing problem. We now know that all of Fermat's conjectures ultimately proved to be solvable and that Fermat's own notes would seem to indicate that he had indeed apparently found ways to solve each of them. But there is no doubt that Fermat's solution could not have relied on the up-to-the-minute maths Wiles employs over 200 pages. So if it was really the limitations of the margin and not of Fermat that inhibited publication… what was Fermat's proof?"
7,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Strap in, guys. I’m going to walk you through the history of how Fermat’s Last Theorum was proved, all in one little (okay, big) review. And I can do this because of this awesome, semi-accessible, frequently tangent-taking, but mostly, this deeply fascinating book.----------STEP ONE: THE THEORUM----------For the unenlightened, Fermat’s Last Theorum is this: you probably know the Pythagorean theorum, a² + b² = c², which explains that if you square the shorter two sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, you get the value of third side squared. This is easily proved (that is, demonstrated to be completely, utterly, logically true via a mathematical proof, using axioms known to be true, which is just like a logic proof if you’ve done philosophy. Or a geometry proof, if you went to 9th grade). Take any triangle, and this will be true. There are infinite solutions to this equation—literally infinite values of A, B, and C which will render this solution true. However, Fermat discovered that the formula an + bn = cn where n > 2 has NO whole number solutions. (Go ahead, give it a whirl. I’ll wait).Then he challenged the mathematical community to create a mathematical proof demonstrating this must be true. While tantalizing them with the knowledge he’d already created a proof for this with a scribbled note in the margin of his notebook: “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Asshole. So sparked centuries of people trying to write this proof, to no avail. Until Professor Andrew Wiles (who has the most apropos name ever—he has wiles indeed) of Cambridge, in 1993.***For clarity, this is Fermat’s Equation (which I’ll refer to as FE): an + bn = cn where n > 2And THIS is Fermat’s Last Theorum (which I’ll refer to as FLT): “There are no solutions to Fermat’s Equation”***----------TANGENT: GODEL----------At this point, it’s been assumed that math is logically perfect—that if you correctly build a proof using axioms (like m + n = n + m), it must be true (and if it’s proven to be true, nothing can prove it to be false). This is known as “axiomatic set theory.” Along came Godel (who is analyzed to death by my beloved, Doug Hofstadter- see here and here). His ideas are as follows: 1. If axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there have to be theorems that can’t be proved or disproved. Why? Because of paradoxes. Godel translated the following statement into mathematical notation: “This statement has no proof.” If that’s false, then you COULD create a proof for that statement—however, that would make the statement false, so how could you have a proof for that? So it has to be true. But if it’s true, it can’t be proved because that’s what it literally says. It’s a mathematical statement that is true, but could never be proved to be true (an “undecidable statement”). 2. There’s no way to prove that axiomatic set theory is consistent; in a way, it’s one of those “undecidable statement” that’s true but can’t be proved to be true. Interestingly, this parallels the physicist Heisenberg’s discovery of the uncertainty principle, but we won’t get into that. Now, there aren’t very many of those undecidable statements. Godel couldn’t really point to any other undecidable statements besides the one above, so people assumed they were found only in the most extreme math and would probably never even be encountered. Welp. A young student named Paul Cohen at Stanford discovered a way to test whether a question is undecidable, and in doing so, discovered several more.Which sparked some fear in mathematicians. What if Fermat’s Last Theorum was undecidable?! What if they were wasting their time trying to prove the unprovable?Interestingly, if it were an undecidable statement, it couldn’t be proved—yet it would have to be true. The theorum says “there are no whole numbers to the equation an + bn = cn where n > 2.” If this were false, then it would be possible to prove this by offering a solution to this—by finding a whole number N that’s greater than 2 that allows the equation to be solved. Which would make it a decidable statement, which is a contradiction. So it can’t be false and also be an undecidable statement. In other words, Fermat’s Last Theorum might be totally true but there might be no way to prove it. ----------STEP TWO: TANIYAMA-SHIMURA CONJECTURE----------Modular forms are a mathematical tool, sort of like impossible forms or shapes, that reveal a lot about how numbers are related. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (TSC), created by two Japanese mathematicians (one of whom tragically and abruptly killed himself quite young) says every modular form is related to a specific elliptic equation (elliptic equations were Andrew Wiles’s main area of study; they’re a type of equation, not super important that you understand them). The fact that these were unified meant there’s a kind of Rosetta stone that’s been discovered: “Simple intuitions in the modular world translate into deep truths in the elliptic world, and vice versa. Very profound problems in the elliptic world can get solved sometimes by translating them using this Rosetta stone into the modular world, and discovering that we have the insights and tools in the modular world to treat the translated problem. Back in the elliptic world we would have been at a loss.”Beyond that awesomeness, the TSC suggests something even more interesting: that possibly all of mathematics, all the different worlds of mathematics, might have parallels in other worlds, as with the elliptic world and the modular world. All of mathematics might be unified—arguably the absolute ultimate goal of abstract mathematics, because this would give us the most complete picture, and the biggest arsenal of tools to solve mathematical problems. ----------STEP THREE: RIBET’S THEORUM----------This is all important for FLT because of something called Ribet’s Theorum (Ribet was a colleague of Wiles). Ribet’s Theorum goes like this: the imagined solution to FE can be translated into an elliptic equation. And that elliptic equation doesn’t seem to have a modular world equivalent. But the TSC claims that every elliptic equation must be related to a modular form. So if you can PROVE that the elliptic form of the solution to FE has no modular form (which we can! The proof was done in 1986), the following is true: if the TSC is true (i.e. all elliptic equations have modular forms), and the elliptic form of the imagined solution to FE has no modular form, then the imagined solution cannot exist, proving FLT. So now, all we have to do is prove that the TSC is true, and FLT is automatically proven to be true. And this—THIS—is what Andrew Wiles focused on. Proving the TSC (Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture).----------STEP FOUR: PROVING THE THEORUM----------Wiles finally succeeded when he applied a new method called the Kolyvagin-Flach method, which groups elliptic equations into families and then proves that an elliptic equation in that family has a modular form; if that elliptic equation has a modular form, then all other elliptic equations in that family also has a modular form. However, the Kolyvagin-Flach method has to be adapted for each family of elliptic equations. Wiles successfully adapted the method for all families of elliptic equations, thereby proving that all elliptic equations have modular forms (which, as a reminder, is basis of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and proving the TSC proves FLT). Two months before I was born, in 1993, he proved FLT in a series of 3 lectures. Kinda. Actually, there was a minor flaw in his proof (essentially, he might have failed to properly adapt the Kolyvagin-Flach method for some of the families of equations) but it doesn’t really matter because a year later, Wiles published a work-around to that flaw, so he proved FLT once and for all. ----------CONCLUSION----------All I can think about is: maybe if math looked like this, if THIS had been our material in high school—maybe then I wouldn’t have disliked it. Maybe other people wouldn’t, either. What a shoddy job we do teaching our children the wonder of learning."
8,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This book is as interesting as a detective story while being about quite advanced mathematics - as such it is quite a book showing the remarkable skill of its writer to explain complex ideas in ways that are always readable and enjoyable.A mathematician finds a simple proof to what seems like a deceptively simple problem of mathematics - that pythagoras's theorem only works if the terms are squared, and not if they are any other power up to infinity. Sounds dull. Except that the mathematician jots down that he has found this proof, but not what the proof is. And for hundredsd of years the greatest minds in mathematics have tried to find this simple proof and been beaten by the problem time and again.This really is a delightful book and one that gives an insight into how mathematicians think about the world. The proof of Pythagoras's theorem given in this book is so simple that the beauty of mathematical proof is made plain to everyone. Just a little knowledge of algebra is needed for this part of the book - the rest requires no maths at all."

10,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,3,"I never watched any documentaries before going to college (and this was about a century and a half ago.. I am getting old -_-. But yeah, 2009 to be precise). I was always interested in NatGeo and History Channel - but they never showed the real deal on television. The documentaries would be mostly half assed, and at worst, total crap. That's also how Indian television landscape can be broadly categorized too, give or take a few exceptions ofcourse. And so I grew up loving the sciences based on what was taught in school curriculum, and elsewhere what I read on the slow 64-bit internet connection.And then college happened. Parents got me my own laptop - and the college intranet had a ton of stuff that other students shared. That place and that time - was where my love for documentaries was born. I had never been so fascinated with anything before. And the first two that I watched - in a long line of them - were Einstein's Biggest Blunder and BBC's Fermat's Last Theorem. The memory of that sunday afternoon is still pretty fresh. Back then, I only had a casual interest in astronomy and cosmology, and Einstein's theories were still something exotic. And so I basically understood jackshit from the first documentary. Even more intrigued than before, I started the second one. Fermat's Last Theorem was much more relatable - I had known the theorem, and understood the concept too. Years later when I joined goodreads, I found out that there was a book too. Keeping in with the tradition of firsts, it became the first book on my TBR pile too. Where it stayed until a few days ago - and I finally marked it as read last night. To be honest, this isn't the greatest book ever. It isnt even Simon Singh's best, who delivered the goods the much better in Big Bang. But it surely captures the essence of all mathematical and scientific endeavor very well - That every once in a while, in the middle of an ordinary life, science gives us a fairytale"
11,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,5,"If you buy the latest Jilly Cooper instead of this you WILL go to hell!This one languished on my bookshelf for the best part of a year as I was too scared to pick it up & start it. What held me back is what will probably put a lot of other potential readers off trying it - the boring old ""I'm no good at maths"" argument. Although my maths education is probably little above average (a good O Level and a terrible A Level, after which I rallied somewhat to obtain a reasonable HNC maths module) it's //very// many years out of use and it's all I can do to add two numbers up in my head. Given that this book is about a problem that flummoxed the best mathematical minds in the world for over 350 years you'd be forgiven for putting this back on the shelf and choosing something a little simpler. Well, don't even try that... YOU DON'T NEED ANY MATHS TO READ THIS! What Singh has done here is to present a hugely complex subject in a hugely entertaining way. The search for the answer to Fermat's riddle reads like a detective story and not a matehematical treatise and it includes a truly absorbing potted history of the development of maths over the years and, from Pythagoras to Fermat to Godel to Wiles, each part has a fascinating human side to it. Budding mathematicians needn't feel left out as the mechanics of the maths is also included, but it's treated in a gentle way: each step of the problem (and it's solution) is described in a simplified (but certainly not dumbed down) manner and some simple exercises are included in several short appendices. However, take heart! There are several places where elements of the maths are obviously too complex for us mortals and Singh is not afraid to say soo and then gloss over them completely. That may be a disappointment to some, but it's not at all unreasonable in my opinion. All in all, the net result is a book that is sensitive to its readers, intelligent, interesting and important. It's literally unputdownable and it had the added bonus of tricking me into thinking that I'm a little cleverer than I really am. I notice there's an inevitable Wills and Kate bio on the bestseller list at the moment. Put your hard earned cash into Andrew Morton's pockets or read something that will make you feel like a genius. The choice is yours."

It combines some high quality storytelling worthy of a good thriller with important scenes in the history of mathematics as well as simple explanations of certain mathematical ideas. It tells the story of one of the (apparently) simplest theorems ever but having one of the hardest possible proofs in mathematics, and how it eventually gets to be proven (around 350 years later!), with admirable simplicity. But most importantly, it shows people the beauty of mathematics. 5/5."
13,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A fantastically entertaining and educational book about the quest to solve the oldest math problem: Fermat's Last Theorem. The intrigue, mystery, and drama surrounding the famous theorem without a proof (but that Fermat had said he had a proof for, just not enough space to write it in the margins) is exciting enough. All the math greats who have attempted to solve it but come up a little short, or a lot short.But it's much more than that, since the final proof of Fermat's Theorem involves so many other math concepts. This book starts and ends with Fermat, but in the middle it is more like a grand tour of all the mathematical developments that make the proof even possible. It's interesting to read about all the different dead ends and other productive findings (that had tangentially made it a little more possible to solve Fermat, but whose main contribution was in some other area). Also, reading about Galois's amazing life always makes me giddy. I mean, I've read about him before, but his story is just so crazy--math genius turned revolutionary thrown in jail involved in affair ends in duel, scribbles out his last thoughts the night before he dies... amazing.But don't expect to understand how the proof actually works by the end. The proof itself is over 100 pages, so there is no way a normal non-math genius can understand it. But you will get a general idea of the approach/trajectory/style of the final beast. Also, some of the math concepts leading up to it are quite easily comprehensible. I wouldn't recommend this book to a math whiz... it's more of a fun read for the layperson.It would ultimately be more satisfying if the proof were a short elegant thing that didn't involve latest groundbreaking discoveries in math. But maybe the bright side is that we can still wonder about Fermat's original (alleged) proof that was never written down. It had to be different from Andrew Wile's proof; does it exist? Or was Fermat bluffing? Or did he make an error in his proof?"
14,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962158-rakesh-m,5,"This book is a biography of the epic quest to solve the eluding Fermat's last theorem. It chronicles the life and works of not just Fermat, but most of the mathematicians having even a tiny bit to do with the conjecture/theorem. Curious and strange revelations into the lives of many of the princes and princesses of mathematics are presented. It presents the case of lives, pursuits and the times that they lived in. The problems that they face (mathematical and others), how these affect the progress/decline of the field. Simon Singh writes brilliantly mixing accounts of math behind the problem along with the lives of these mathematicians. We get to see accounts of love, suicides, suicide averted by fixating on a proof, duels and revolutionaries. For me it was shocking to know, that it was not just the kings and religious fellows destroying these geniuses and their sanctuaries, but Pythagoras also committed a grave mistake once, sentencing Hippasus to death for arguing that sqrt(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction!A must read for those interested in history behind the problem."

Starting off with ancient Greeks and arriving at the proof using modern mathematics, he explains the struggles of generations of mathematicians. The author never tries to overwhelm us with the mathematics, but tells us about the people who were involved in proving the theorem. Having said that, all the mathematics in the book can be understood with a background in high school mathematics. This book is a great read simply because of the intellectual achievement that it talks about. Strongly recommended if you're remotely interested in mathematics."

The words in this book were used for telling a story about numbers, which made me realize I also love numbers so much, I just didn’t know. Math had always been the “easy subject” at school for me, the one which did not require long hours of study, because it was so logical, the one you could check before turning in an exam and know you had the right answers precisely because it matched so perfectly. “Proof is what lies at the heart of maths.”, indeed, so simple, so beautiful. Well, this story is, as the title describes, a true quest to solve one of the most difficult problems in Mathematics which Fermat’s Last Theorem used to be. Simon Singh did this superbly. He is absolutely great at explaining from whole numbers and 1+1 to elliptical equations and modular forms. But the best was to learn about some of the greatest minds that worked so hard in the last century solving problems and doing the maths that have been the basis and tool for proving this theorem and thus, their great contribution to science: Pythagoras and his controversial Pythagorean Brotherhood, Mersenne, Euclid, Diophantus and his most remarkable “Arithmetica”, of course Pierre de Fermat, Pascal, brilliant Euler, Cantor, Sophie Germain, Theano, Hypatia, Maria Agnesi, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Cauchy, Lamè, Kummer, Wolfskehl, Gödel, Turing, Shimura, Taniyama, and Andrew Wiles. These are not the only ones, of course, but the most outstanding for me from this book. I want to make a special mention to the part where Singh talks about the work of women that were mathematicians. Even as of today, there aren’t many of us women dedicated to numbers or number theory, but we have come to a time when we can actually pursue this career, despite the struggles and obstacles that still exist in our societies. But being a mathematician a few centuries ago was completely outrageous and out of this world! Sophie Germain had to study secretly at night and keep a secret stock of candles to do so, because her dad used to confiscate them to prevent her from studying. Or Agnesi who was referred to as the “witch of Agnesi”. And the most extreme of these was Hypatia of Alexandria who suffered the most tragic and brutal death to the hands of the exulted mob led by the patriarch of Alexandria because she was considered a heretic. These stories really moved me and I’m very glad that their names are remembered and admired although they did not have a voice in their own time. Their only voice was their endless curiosity and passion for trying to understand the Universe and their brilliant work pervaded through history and remained printed in our books and forever in our memories, a greatly deserved honor to inspire all of us. And back to Fermat’s Theorem, Wiles amazing work on his childhood’s dream inspired this book and will hopefully inspire many more that see the beauty of numbers to keep working and pushing the frontiers on this science field which Singh perfectly describes as the “language of nature”."

My only gripe with this book is that the author tries to push a narrative a little too hard and tends to over-dramatize certain details. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable mathematical journey. Simon Singh has done well to make the book accessible and not overtly mathematical and confusing to read."

The story starts with Andrew Wiles who brought an end to this endless wait. But the span of the story is far far larger. Love stories, tragedies, moments of brilliances, moments of inspiration, moments of chance all intertwined in a marvellous way to solve this enigma. Did Fermat really have a foolproof proof? If he had it with the tools available at his time, then it still remains an enigma. Simon Singh brings to us this wonderful story in a brilliant way. "

I don't do mathematics and haven't studied anything beyond the bare minimum required for a Bachelor's degree, but I find something wonderful about the pursuits of people like Andrew Wiles and the number theorists who spend years of their lives working on a set of problems. Wiles's obsessive mindset and solitary quest reminded of Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season"" and I wonder if Carlson read this or another account of Wiles's eight-year project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem? (From ""Towel Season"":)When they were dating, he'd begun to try to explain his work to her in metaphors, and she'd continued the game through his career, asking him for comparisons that she'd then inhabit, embellish. Right after they were married and Edison was in graduate school, he'd work late into the night in their apartment and crawl into bed with the calculations still percolating in his head. ""What's it like?"" Leslie would ask. ""Where are you now?"" She could tell he was remote, lit. They talked in territories.""I've crossed all the open ground, and the wind has stopped now. My hope is to find a way through this next place.""""Mountains?""""Right. Okay, mountains--blank, very few markings."" He spoke carefully and with a quiet zeal. ""They're steep, hard to see.""""Is it cold?""""No, but it is strange. It's quiet."" Then he'd turn to her in bed, his eyes bright, alive. ""I'm way past the path. I don't think anyone has climbed this route before. There are no trails, handholds.""Leslie would smile and kiss him in that close proximity. ""Keep going,"" she'd say. ""Halfway up that mountain, there's a woman with a cappuccino cart and a chicken-salad sandwich--me.""Then a smile would break across his face, too, and he would see her, kiss her back, and say it: ""Right. You.""A book has yet to fulfill my odd wish to peek over the shoulder of a mathematician working on a problem like Fermat's Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. Until a science writer like Singh explained it in metaphors and broad concepts I wouldn't understand what the mathematician was doing, but wouldn't it be weirdly magical to observe!"

I think that what I liked the most about this book is that I was actually able to understand a good sixty percent of it. With the other forty percent, I proceeded on faith. Come to think of it, those percentages hold true for the rest of my life. There are times when your best bet is to find a good math book. Two plus two is four.

23,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"well, the main thing i took from this book is probably that maths is a field for privileged white men. you have to be rich enough to be able to live comfortably while devoting their life to solving a centuries-old problem simply because they think proving it would be ""satisfying"". you must also be white - or at least living in the west - so that you are actually recognized for your work, otherwise your work will be spotted by someone who lives in the west who will take credit for it. and you must be male. obviously. the politics of the world of mathematics is interesting stuff folks. anyway, it's an alright book. very informative n clear (most of the time). also pretty funny. although i would recommend the 1st half of the book to pretty much anyone, it does sort of get a bit jargon-y and vague by the end. i still enjoyed it, but not at much as i did the first half. i did find the lack of dates for all the events a bit annoying. singh often jumped from event to event, without giving his readers a very good timeline of happenings. aaaanyway. i still learnt a lot from this book. and it's very engaging. if you're interested at all in the history of mathematics, i would definitely recommend. it doesn't really tell you how to solve fermat's last theorem (you'd have to read a 200 page paper to find out sorry), but it gives you a pretty good overview of how mathematicians collectively got there. while also including a couple maths puzzles and a collection of proofs in the back <3 (i love proofs)"
24,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10375644-akanksha,5,"Most interesting non-fiction book I have ever read.Simon Singh's style of weaving a scientific concept into a beautiful story leaves no occasion for the fictional characters and plots. The narration flows like acetone. The book starts with the climax moment of a 358 year old struggle “Fermat's last theorem”. Singh's writing style paints the whole view (awestruck people, ecstatic protagonist, exuberant surroundings) in front of your eyes. Singh is successful in seizing reader's undivided attention when he recounts the moment when the seed of this curiosity was sown in 10yr. old Wile's mind. And then, starts the roller coaster ride of the great minds who faced the thunderstorms and sunshine in Mathematical history. This book is no less than a time travel machine, which takes us to the ancient Egypt where this beguiling discipline spent its babyhood . Then the journey proceeds era by era, riddle by riddle from 3000 BC to the auspicious day when Wiles finally bid adieu to his childhood dream. Before I could even realize, I was already there with the great mathematicians, feeling the euphoria of slaughtering a puzzle, the frustration of long struggles, standing against the whole world for the love of Mathematics. Reading experience is elevated 1000 folds by the introduction of small mathematical teasers in between the chapters, when a highly motivated mathematician hidden in you will jump to iron it out. Singh takes us through the history of Mathematics related to FLT chronologically depicting many interesting stories. By the time you reach the ending, you are so engrossed in this world that you can experience the pain in the predicaments faced by Andrew Wiles. You will be able to empathize with the setbacks, hopes and tussles Wiles faced when his childhood dream was about to shatter after making it almost there!Best part of the book is “The return of Wiles”, the scenes from “The Dark Knight Rises” running alongside in my mind. One real life example of the victory of the “Never say die” doctrine. Truly mentioned in Daily Mail - “story of an obsessive love affair”!A must read for every enigma lover!"

Unfortunately, so was this book and my quest continues. Nonetheless, this book is very interesting and well written, and shows you how many things that appear to be simple and almost intuitive can be incredibly complex (that's what's so beautiful about math). In situations like this, people always tend to give all the praise to people like Andrew Wiles, without realizing on how much work and discoveries made by other people his work relies on. And even though Wiles deserves all the fame and recognition he can get for his persistence and determination, it's nice to see all the other great mathematicians who greatly contributed being mentioned. Like old saying goes: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes, and if anything, by showing how complex the proof is, it leaves you wondering, did the Fermat really have the solution?If you are only slightly interested in mathematics and were just curious about this certain topic and ideas on which the proof was based on, or are looking for a good place to start, I would definitively recommend this book. But to be fair, you can get all of that by watching previously mentioned documentary and it would cost you much less time. On the other hand, if you want something more complex and mathematical, you won't get it here."
26,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35395038-amith,4,"This book finds a way to narrate the chain of events from the time of Pythagoras to the final proof of Fermat's last theorem by Andrew Wiles, entwining with it the key mathematical concepts presented in an accessible form and stories of the mathematicians who made those contributions. It conveys perfectly to a layman the sense of accomplishment that the mathematical community associates with cracking the proof for this theorem. In that sense, it has the effect of a self-help book even without trying to be one."
27,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299698-pawan,5,"http://iandbooks.wordpress.comIn a way this book “Fermat’s Last Theorem” is a fantasy come true. To be able to read about complex Mathematics in a story book style is something that was possible only in this book by Simon Singh. Before I picked up this book I had no idea about Fermat’s last theorem or its significance. I just read the summary on the back page and felt like picking up the book and once I started reading it, there was no stopping it, though I did skipped over complex mathematical equations part.Fermat’s last theorem states that no set of positive three integers exist such thatan + bn = cnis satisfied for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and he claimed in his writing that he had a proof of this theorem but he did not have space left on the paper on which he was writing at that time. After his death hundreds of Mathematicians across the world tried unsuccessfully for many centuries to get the generic proof but the final proof was found only in 1995. Even though the proof has been found it is based on very complex mathematical models that were not in existence during Fermat’s time. So, it is still a mystery, how Fermat had that proof that was very simple.The book traces this history of Fermat’s last theorem. It is a fascinating story of how the best minds could not figure out something that was done by Fermat such a long time ago. The significance of this theorem is not that it brings some new understanding to the world of Mathematics but lies in the simplicity of the theorem and exceedingly complex proof of it."
28,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance,5,"Absolutely fantastic.The descriptions of all the maths and discoveries in this book are nothing short of joyful, and I felt so excited to be reading all of it. The book explains and shows why math is so amazing, how it is a divine language that describes something (i.e., number properties and their relationships) that exists outside of the physical world, how mathematicians are then often more in search of a truth in the real sense of the word than in search of a practical application or an explanation, how math discoveries can be magical and fulfilling and immortal in that they are untouched by human perception. My heart literally started beating faster when I saw the published first page of the proof. The book does a great job of conveying a narrative arc and giving background when necessary, and in presenting a pretty complicated topic in an accessible but not-dumbed down way. (Although in the U.S. the title of the book was changed to “Fermat’s Enigma,"" sigh.)Also, quite charmingly, one of the major turning points in the book is a conversation at Cafe Strada in which someone exclaims, “But don’t you see? You’ve done it! All you have to do is add some gamma-zero of (M) structure and just run through your argument and it works. It gives you everything you need.”I learned that mathematicians are big weirdos, and that they like to chat each other up at tea every day. I also learned that 10^10^10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics.”Thanks for the rec Sue!"
29,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"The book is a quick read. There is just enough information in it for a layman to know sufficiently about the Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof to be able to boast at a coffee table discussion with friends. And that's all.While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the poof of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view that is sometimes a bit arguable and of course oversimplified. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably. Trying to condense the basic ideas of the comprehensive proof that only few top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. Still I feel that the essence should have been in the math, but the reader gets instead a inspiring story, about a man's zealous quest for an absolute truth."
30,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Simon Singh has the ability to present a story about a mathematics problem, and tell it like a detective story. He makes the subject exciting, even though the outcome is well known. Singh intersperses history with discussions about the mathematics, and makes it quite understandable. Singh starts with the roots of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, by recounting the stories and mathematics of Pythagoras, Euclid, and Euler. Other, less well-known mathematicians are also given credit, for example Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin Cauchy, and Evariste Galois. Three hundred fifty years ago, Fermat wrote the following theorem in the margin of a mathematics book:  And, Fermat wrote that he had a marvelous proof, but no room in the margin for it. For centuries, mathematicians have attempted to prove the theorem, without success. It had been sort of a ""holy grail"" of mathematicians to prove the theorem, and many brilliant minds spent years on it. Perhaps in was unprovable, and worst of all, Kurt Godel showed that some theorems are actually undecidable--that is to say, it is impossible even to decide whether or not a theorem is true.Singh recounts a fascinating story of the gifted mathematician, Paul Wolfskehl. He was very depressed, and decided to commit suicide on a particular night, at midnight. While waiting for that time to arrive, he started to read about the failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He became so engrossed in the subject, that he worked well past midnight. He found a gap in the logic of a predecessor, and was so proud of himself that he gained a new desire for life. And, in his will he established a fund of 100,000 marks to be given to the mathematician who first completes the proof of the theorem!Much of the book describes how Andrew Wiles developed a growing interest in the theorem. He worked in almost total isolation for seven years, in order not to be distracted. He occasionally published little tidbits unrelated to his real endeavor, in order to dispel suspicions about what his real work entailed.The central piece of the proof entailed proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, that linked modular forms with elliptic equations. This was a linkage between two far-flung branches of mathematics that seemed to be totally unrelated. To prove the conjecture would allow incredible advances to be made. And then, Ken Ribet showed that a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would, in effect, be a direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But many people tried and failed to develop the proof. But that is exactly what Andrew Wiles worked on for so many years.I had previously read that during Andrew Wiles' famous lecture, he just casually let the unsuspecting audience know, ""and that is a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."" Well, this book tells a somewhat different story. Most of the audience had heard rumors that the third of Wiles' lectures would be of historical significance. They came prepared with cameras, and took photographs during the lecture. So, it was a surprise, but not a total surprise.After Wiles' manuscript of the proof was sent to a publisher, six mathematicians reviewed it, and a crucial gap was found in it. Wiles worked furiously for a nightmarish year, and with the help of Richard Taylor, finally closed the gap. Today, Wiles is recognized as the one who developed the proof. But it is clear, that Wiles ""stood on the shoulders of giants""; he used--and developed--mathematical techniques that had not existed just a few decades previously.Simon Singh writes with a wonderful style. It is clear, not too jargon-heavy but contains enough mathematical ""meat"" to seem satisfying. The book is followed by ten appendixes that contain more details about some of the mathematics; they are not overly technical, and give the reader a better understanding of some of the issues. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in math. "
31,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"Before delving into the book itself, I thought I’d start things off by introducing the problem it’s concerned with, just in case you aren’t already familiar with it.So, what exactly is Fermat’s Last Theorem? Well, basically, this is it: As you can see, the conjecture is quite easy to understand, and yet, believe it or not, it was so remarkably difficult to prove that it took over 350 years to accomplish! The fact that Fermat (teasingly?) scribbled this rather infuriating note in the margin only added to the frustration felt by the scores of mathematicians who did battle with it over the centuries: “I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.”No doubt the cheeky bastard would’ve enjoyed Twitter:Okay, now that that’s been taken care of, it’s time to look at the actual book.What Kind of Book is Fermat’s Enigma?Simply put, Fermat’s Enigma is a history book. It is most definitely NOT a math book, so don’t expect to find any degree of mathematical rigor or complexity here. There are a handful of fairly simple proofs included in the appendices, but overall, the concepts under discussion are glossed over in a superficial manner, never examined in any kind of detail. If you want something that fleshes out how the proof actually works, I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere. (Singh was kind enough to include quite a few “further reading suggestions” at the end of this book. While I’ve not looked into any of the titles he recommended, I assume many of those might prove more to your liking if you prefer a “math book” on the subject.)In any case, while Singh did not pursue the actual mathematics in any real sense, he did positively excel at telling the story of an utterly fascinating struggle, one which spanned hundreds of years and ensnared countless brilliant, talented minds. Readers make the acquaintance of such notable mathematicians as Pythagoras (whose work paved the way for Fermat), Leonhard Euler, Paul Wolfskehl, Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Evariste Galois, Yutaka Taniyama, Goro Shimura, and of course Andrew Wiles, the man, the myth, the legend who finally proved the damn thing. Overall, I was surprised and delighted by just how compelling the story actually was. For me, this book quickly became a veritable page-turner, one I was loathe to put aside. Some may argue that in order to accomplish this, he omitted too much relevant information, that he sacrificed depth for readability. Perhaps this is true to an extent, but in my opinion, while it was admittedly easy to read and follow, it still managed to include a fair amount of pertinent, interesting material. More importantly, it never got bogged down with unnecessary details or lost in minutiae, and never meandered down exasperating tangents, as many otherwise outstanding history books are wont to do. And ultimately, what made this book so very stimulating was that the manner in which the story was told really made it come alive. Singh bestowed a truly suspenseful, exciting quest upon the reader, one full of twists and turns, and even *gasp* its fair share of drama. He enthusiastically demonstrated just how action-packed and exhilarating the life of the mind can be. And for accomplishing this tremendous feat, I heartily recommend the book, warts and all.And Now, For a Few Words on the Star of the ShowAndrew Wiles is an extraordinary human being. Fascinated by Fermat’s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, he vowed to conquer that most impossible of proofs. This was at the age of ten, mind you. I seriously can’t get past that. And then, true to his word, the little rascal grew up to become an eminent mathematician, one who finally went into seclusion for seven years in order to hack away at this tremendous proof. While a not insignificant error marred the first release of said proof, he didn’t let that deter him, but persevered and managed to rectify the error, and, within a couple of years, came out with THE proof. Holy goddamn shit. To me, Wiles’ story was completely and utterly inspiring. I was frankly amazed by what the human mind can achieve; I think I will always be in awe of Wiles’ fierce determination and incredible tenacity. Mad respect. Anyway, as you can probably tell, Andrew Wiles is a personal hero of mine. He is an undeniable, ultimate badass. Wayne and Garth said it best:"

A very trite remark, too lengthy to write in the margin so it is elsewhere, and no one has ever found it or managed to prove his statement, until - - - this book is a brilliant read, you would think it would be as dry as dust, but no! It is a superb account of the proof of the last theorem from Fermat's notebook to be proven. The only thing that still niggles at me, although the mathematical proof is fabulous, it uses modern techniques not available to Fermat, so it is proven but how the hell did Fermat do it??????A brilliant book, beautifully written a tremendous historical question answered in a very modern way, fabulous, well done for readability."

35,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This is the kind of book that we non mathematical minds can easily digest and love. It gives you an epic scope of the number of minds that it takes to build new ideas. I doubt if Fermat had actually solved this theorem correctly, but this is impossible to prove. Fermat's theorem however was not impossible to prove! It was solved! Thanks to the efforts of many men (and women!) over many lifetimes and one final man who had the determination and persistence to finish the unthinkable. This book has a lot of wonderful elements, and really exemplifies a love of mathematics. Although if you want to actually understand the theorem this book may not be for you! I can honestly say reading it did not put the theorem in any more digestible light than it started out with. Perhaps it was to the authors advantage to skip the technicalities and focus on the enjoyment of the journey. I personally loved this approach, but it may not be for everyone, especially if you are actually looking to understand the theorem (a massive undertaking that is really not in my repertoire to comment on). "
36,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"What a fun book this was (thanks, Trevor, for the recommendation)! There are many reasons I think I like (good) nonfiction -- a sense of direct relevance, gravitas, frequent insights into the workings of the universe (and people), but mostly for knowledge narcs -- high levels of information density served up into an intriguing package by someone else who has undertaken the heavy lifting (research, organization, thinking). So, here in Singh's work I get a solid lay understanding not only of the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem, but of much of mathematics (and the lives of mathematicians) since the seventeenth century.I've been thinking also about what attracts me to books on mathematical topics -- the works by Martin Gardner, William Poundstone, and the various other authors in the company of whose thoughts I've had pleasure to spend a week or more. What I've come away with, is that the best of them feed off surprises, those bits of counterintuitive anecdotes that leave you blurting out, ""Huh. How about that,"" and then looking madly around for someone to tell. Like a book of jokes, riddles, or puzzles that provides immediate gratification in the back of the book, Fermat's Enigma plugs at least ten conundrums (and their easy-to-understand, logical solutions) into its appendices. For example -- say you're unlucky enough to be forced into a three-way duel. If everyone gets to take turns in order of their skill such that worst shoots first, what should the worst do? Aim at the best in the hopes of getting lucky and eliminating the most dangerous gunsel? Nope, the correct answer is to pass up the turn in the hopes that your first shot will get to be expended against only one remaining combatant. That way, even if you miss, you at least had a chance to take aim at the only person able to shoot back.Pierre Fermat turns out to have been quite the prankster, often tweaking professional mathematicians and academics by mailing them problems they knew full well he had already solved. For those who don't keep this type of trivia at the forefront of their brains, Fermat's the French recluse (and hanging circuit jurist) who once famously scribbled in a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica that x^n + y^n ≠ z^n for any number n greater than 2, a propostion for which he had ""a truly marvelous demonstration… which this margin is too narrow to contain."" This gets to be Fermat's Last Theorem, simply because it ends up being the last of his conundrums to be proven (not necessarily the last one he wrote). Just think, were it not for the scrupulous care taken by Fermat's son to go through and publish all of Fermat, Sr.'s writings, the world would not have been tantalized by this particular gem for 
over 350 YEARS
.Andrew Wiles published the first (and only?) proof in 1994, and Enigma does a tremendous job of walking the reader through not only the stunning depth of his intellectual achievement, but its significance as well. Suffice it to say that I was happy here to read that Taniyama-Shimura get their well-earned due and that modular and elliptical equations can finally be understood to be mathematically analogous (whether or not I have any idea what modular equations actually are). Still, all of this leads to what I think is an even more tantalizing problem. We now know that all of Fermat's conjectures ultimately proved to be solvable and that Fermat's own notes would seem to indicate that he had indeed apparently found ways to solve each of them. But there is no doubt that Fermat's solution could not have relied on the up-to-the-minute maths Wiles employs over 200 pages. So if it was really the limitations of the margin and not of Fermat that inhibited publication… what was Fermat's proof?"

And I can do this because of this awesome, semi-accessible, frequently tangent-taking, but mostly, this deeply fascinating book.----------STEP ONE: THE THEORUM----------For the unenlightened, Fermat’s Last Theorum is this: you probably know the Pythagorean theorum, a² + b² = c², which explains that if you square the shorter two sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, you get the value of third side squared. This is easily proved (that is, demonstrated to be completely, utterly, logically true via a mathematical proof, using axioms known to be true, which is just like a logic proof if you’ve done philosophy. Or a geometry proof, if you went to 9th grade). Take any triangle, and this will be true. There are infinite solutions to this equation—literally infinite values of A, B, and C which will render this solution true. However, Fermat discovered that the formula an + bn = cn where n > 2 has NO whole number solutions. (Go ahead, give it a whirl. I’ll wait).Then he challenged the mathematical community to create a mathematical proof demonstrating this must be true. While tantalizing them with the knowledge he’d already created a proof for this with a scribbled note in the margin of his notebook: “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Asshole. So sparked centuries of people trying to write this proof, to no avail. Until Professor Andrew Wiles (who has the most apropos name ever—he has wiles indeed) of Cambridge, in 1993.***For clarity, this is Fermat’s Equation (which I’ll refer to as FE): an + bn = cn where n > 2And THIS is Fermat’s Last Theorum (which I’ll refer to as FLT): “There are no solutions to Fermat’s Equation”***----------TANGENT: GODEL----------At this point, it’s been assumed that math is logically perfect—that if you correctly build a proof using axioms (like m + n = n + m), it must be true (and if it’s proven to be true, nothing can prove it to be false). This is known as “axiomatic set theory.” Along came Godel (who is analyzed to death by my beloved, Doug Hofstadter- see here and here). His ideas are as follows: 1. If axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there have to be theorems that can’t be proved or disproved. Why? Because of paradoxes. Godel translated the following statement into mathematical notation: “This statement has no proof.” If that’s false, then you COULD create a proof for that statement—however, that would make the statement false, so how could you have a proof for that? So it has to be true. But if it’s true, it can’t be proved because that’s what it literally says. It’s a mathematical statement that is true, but could never be proved to be true (an “undecidable statement”). 2. There’s no way to prove that axiomatic set theory is consistent; in a way, it’s one of those “undecidable statement” that’s true but can’t be proved to be true. Interestingly, this parallels the physicist Heisenberg’s discovery of the uncertainty principle, but we won’t get into that. Now, there aren’t very many of those undecidable statements. Godel couldn’t really point to any other undecidable statements besides the one above, so people assumed they were found only in the most extreme math and would probably never even be encountered. Welp. A young student named Paul Cohen at Stanford discovered a way to test whether a question is undecidable, and in doing so, discovered several more.Which sparked some fear in mathematicians. What if Fermat’s Last Theorum was undecidable?! What if they were wasting their time trying to prove the unprovable?Interestingly, if it were an undecidable statement, it couldn’t be proved—yet it would have to be true. The theorum says “there are no whole numbers to the equation an + bn = cn where n > 2.” If this were false, then it would be possible to prove this by offering a solution to this—by finding a whole number N that’s greater than 2 that allows the equation to be solved. Which would make it a decidable statement, which is a contradiction. So it can’t be false and also be an undecidable statement. In other words, Fermat’s Last Theorum might be totally true but there might be no way to prove it. ----------STEP TWO: TANIYAMA-SHIMURA CONJECTURE----------Modular forms are a mathematical tool, sort of like impossible forms or shapes, that reveal a lot about how numbers are related. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (TSC), created by two Japanese mathematicians (one of whom tragically and abruptly killed himself quite young) says every modular form is related to a specific elliptic equation (elliptic equations were Andrew Wiles’s main area of study; they’re a type of equation, not super important that you understand them). The fact that these were unified meant there’s a kind of Rosetta stone that’s been discovered: “Simple intuitions in the modular world translate into deep truths in the elliptic world, and vice versa. Very profound problems in the elliptic world can get solved sometimes by translating them using this Rosetta stone into the modular world, and discovering that we have the insights and tools in the modular world to treat the translated problem. Back in the elliptic world we would have been at a loss.”Beyond that awesomeness, the TSC suggests something even more interesting: that possibly all of mathematics, all the different worlds of mathematics, might have parallels in other worlds, as with the elliptic world and the modular world. All of mathematics might be unified—arguably the absolute ultimate goal of abstract mathematics, because this would give us the most complete picture, and the biggest arsenal of tools to solve mathematical problems. ----------STEP THREE: RIBET’S THEORUM----------This is all important for FLT because of something called Ribet’s Theorum (Ribet was a colleague of Wiles). Ribet’s Theorum goes like this: the imagined solution to FE can be translated into an elliptic equation. And that elliptic equation doesn’t seem to have a modular world equivalent. But the TSC claims that every elliptic equation must be related to a modular form. So if you can PROVE that the elliptic form of the solution to FE has no modular form (which we can! The proof was done in 1986), the following is true: if the TSC is true (i.e. all elliptic equations have modular forms), and the elliptic form of the imagined solution to FE has no modular form, then the imagined solution cannot exist, proving FLT. So now, all we have to do is prove that the TSC is true, and FLT is automatically proven to be true. And this—THIS—is what Andrew Wiles focused on. Proving the TSC (Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture).----------STEP FOUR: PROVING THE THEORUM----------Wiles finally succeeded when he applied a new method called the Kolyvagin-Flach method, which groups elliptic equations into families and then proves that an elliptic equation in that family has a modular form; if that elliptic equation has a modular form, then all other elliptic equations in that family also has a modular form. However, the Kolyvagin-Flach method has to be adapted for each family of elliptic equations. Wiles successfully adapted the method for all families of elliptic equations, thereby proving that all elliptic equations have modular forms (which, as a reminder, is basis of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and proving the TSC proves FLT). Two months before I was born, in 1993, he proved FLT in a series of 3 lectures. Kinda. Actually, there was a minor flaw in his proof (essentially, he might have failed to properly adapt the Kolyvagin-Flach method for some of the families of equations) but it doesn’t really matter because a year later, Wiles published a work-around to that flaw, so he proved FLT once and for all. ----------CONCLUSION----------All I can think about is: maybe if math looked like this, if THIS had been our material in high school—maybe then I wouldn’t have disliked it. Maybe other people wouldn’t, either. What a shoddy job we do teaching our children the wonder of learning."
38,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This book is as interesting as a detective story while being about quite advanced mathematics - as such it is quite a book showing the remarkable skill of its writer to explain complex ideas in ways that are always readable and enjoyable.A mathematician finds a simple proof to what seems like a deceptively simple problem of mathematics - that pythagoras's theorem only works if the terms are squared, and not if they are any other power up to infinity. Sounds dull. Except that the mathematician jots down that he has found this proof, but not what the proof is. And for hundredsd of years the greatest minds in mathematics have tried to find this simple proof and been beaten by the problem time and again.This really is a delightful book and one that gives an insight into how mathematicians think about the world. The proof of Pythagoras's theorem given in this book is so simple that the beauty of mathematical proof is made plain to everyone. Just a little knowledge of algebra is needed for this part of the book - the rest requires no maths at all."

40,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,3,"I never watched any documentaries before going to college (and this was about a century and a half ago.. I am getting old -_-. But yeah, 2009 to be precise). I was always interested in NatGeo and History Channel - but they never showed the real deal on television. The documentaries would be mostly half assed, and at worst, total crap. That's also how Indian television landscape can be broadly categorized too, give or take a few exceptions ofcourse. And so I grew up loving the sciences based on what was taught in school curriculum, and elsewhere what I read on the slow 64-bit internet connection.And then college happened. Parents got me my own laptop - and the college intranet had a ton of stuff that other students shared. That place and that time - was where my love for documentaries was born. I had never been so fascinated with anything before. And the first two that I watched - in a long line of them - were Einstein's Biggest Blunder and BBC's Fermat's Last Theorem. The memory of that sunday afternoon is still pretty fresh. Back then, I only had a casual interest in astronomy and cosmology, and Einstein's theories were still something exotic. And so I basically understood jackshit from the first documentary. Even more intrigued than before, I started the second one. Fermat's Last Theorem was much more relatable - I had known the theorem, and understood the concept too. Years later when I joined goodreads, I found out that there was a book too. Keeping in with the tradition of firsts, it became the first book on my TBR pile too. Where it stayed until a few days ago - and I finally marked it as read last night. To be honest, this isn't the greatest book ever. It isnt even Simon Singh's best, who delivered the goods the much better in Big Bang. But it surely captures the essence of all mathematical and scientific endeavor very well - That every once in a while, in the middle of an ordinary life, science gives us a fairytale"
41,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,5,"If you buy the latest Jilly Cooper instead of this you WILL go to hell!This one languished on my bookshelf for the best part of a year as I was too scared to pick it up & start it. What held me back is what will probably put a lot of other potential readers off trying it - the boring old ""I'm no good at maths"" argument. Although my maths education is probably little above average (a good O Level and a terrible A Level, after which I rallied somewhat to obtain a reasonable HNC maths module) it's //very// many years out of use and it's all I can do to add two numbers up in my head. Given that this book is about a problem that flummoxed the best mathematical minds in the world for over 350 years you'd be forgiven for putting this back on the shelf and choosing something a little simpler. Well, don't even try that... YOU DON'T NEED ANY MATHS TO READ THIS! What Singh has done here is to present a hugely complex subject in a hugely entertaining way. The search for the answer to Fermat's riddle reads like a detective story and not a matehematical treatise and it includes a truly absorbing potted history of the development of maths over the years and, from Pythagoras to Fermat to Godel to Wiles, each part has a fascinating human side to it. Budding mathematicians needn't feel left out as the mechanics of the maths is also included, but it's treated in a gentle way: each step of the problem (and it's solution) is described in a simplified (but certainly not dumbed down) manner and some simple exercises are included in several short appendices. However, take heart! There are several places where elements of the maths are obviously too complex for us mortals and Singh is not afraid to say soo and then gloss over them completely. That may be a disappointment to some, but it's not at all unreasonable in my opinion. All in all, the net result is a book that is sensitive to its readers, intelligent, interesting and important. It's literally unputdownable and it had the added bonus of tricking me into thinking that I'm a little cleverer than I really am. I notice there's an inevitable Wills and Kate bio on the bestseller list at the moment. Put your hard earned cash into Andrew Morton's pockets or read something that will make you feel like a genius. The choice is yours."
42,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46468957-paul,5,"This is by far the best popular science book I've read. It combines some high quality storytelling worthy of a good thriller with important scenes in the history of mathematics as well as simple explanations of certain mathematical ideas. It tells the story of one of the (apparently) simplest theorems ever but having one of the hardest possible proofs in mathematics, and how it eventually gets to be proven (around 350 years later!), with admirable simplicity. But most importantly, it shows people the beauty of mathematics. 5/5."
43,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A fantastically entertaining and educational book about the quest to solve the oldest math problem: Fermat's Last Theorem. The intrigue, mystery, and drama surrounding the famous theorem without a proof (but that Fermat had said he had a proof for, just not enough space to write it in the margins) is exciting enough. All the math greats who have attempted to solve it but come up a little short, or a lot short.But it's much more than that, since the final proof of Fermat's Theorem involves so many other math concepts. This book starts and ends with Fermat, but in the middle it is more like a grand tour of all the mathematical developments that make the proof even possible. It's interesting to read about all the different dead ends and other productive findings (that had tangentially made it a little more possible to solve Fermat, but whose main contribution was in some other area). Also, reading about Galois's amazing life always makes me giddy. I mean, I've read about him before, but his story is just so crazy--math genius turned revolutionary thrown in jail involved in affair ends in duel, scribbles out his last thoughts the night before he dies... amazing.But don't expect to understand how the proof actually works by the end. The proof itself is over 100 pages, so there is no way a normal non-math genius can understand it. But you will get a general idea of the approach/trajectory/style of the final beast. Also, some of the math concepts leading up to it are quite easily comprehensible. I wouldn't recommend this book to a math whiz... it's more of a fun read for the layperson.It would ultimately be more satisfying if the proof were a short elegant thing that didn't involve latest groundbreaking discoveries in math. But maybe the bright side is that we can still wonder about Fermat's original (alleged) proof that was never written down. It had to be different from Andrew Wile's proof; does it exist? Or was Fermat bluffing? Or did he make an error in his proof?"
44,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962158-rakesh-m,5,"This book is a biography of the epic quest to solve the eluding Fermat's last theorem. It chronicles the life and works of not just Fermat, but most of the mathematicians having even a tiny bit to do with the conjecture/theorem. Curious and strange revelations into the lives of many of the princes and princesses of mathematics are presented. It presents the case of lives, pursuits and the times that they lived in. The problems that they face (mathematical and others), how these affect the progress/decline of the field. Simon Singh writes brilliantly mixing accounts of math behind the problem along with the lives of these mathematicians. We get to see accounts of love, suicides, suicide averted by fixating on a proof, duels and revolutionaries. For me it was shocking to know, that it was not just the kings and religious fellows destroying these geniuses and their sanctuaries, but Pythagoras also committed a grave mistake once, sentencing Hippasus to death for arguing that sqrt(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction!A must read for those interested in history behind the problem."

46,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8700554-hariprasad,4,"Simon Singh gives an excellent account of the quest for the solution to Fermat's puzzle. Starting off with ancient Greeks and arriving at the proof using modern mathematics, he explains the struggles of generations of mathematicians. The author never tries to overwhelm us with the mathematics, but tells us about the people who were involved in proving the theorem. Having said that, all the mathematics in the book can be understood with a background in high school mathematics. This book is a great read simply because of the intellectual achievement that it talks about. Strongly recommended if you're remotely interested in mathematics."
47,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"I have a special love for words. I think I always have. They’re fascinating. The words in this book were used for telling a story about numbers, which made me realize I also love numbers so much, I just didn’t know. Math had always been the “easy subject” at school for me, the one which did not require long hours of study, because it was so logical, the one you could check before turning in an exam and know you had the right answers precisely because it matched so perfectly. “Proof is what lies at the heart of maths.”, indeed, so simple, so beautiful. Well, this story is, as the title describes, a true quest to solve one of the most difficult problems in Mathematics which Fermat’s Last Theorem used to be. Simon Singh did this superbly. He is absolutely great at explaining from whole numbers and 1+1 to elliptical equations and modular forms. But the best was to learn about some of the greatest minds that worked so hard in the last century solving problems and doing the maths that have been the basis and tool for proving this theorem and thus, their great contribution to science: Pythagoras and his controversial Pythagorean Brotherhood, Mersenne, Euclid, Diophantus and his most remarkable “Arithmetica”, of course Pierre de Fermat, Pascal, brilliant Euler, Cantor, Sophie Germain, Theano, Hypatia, Maria Agnesi, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Cauchy, Lamè, Kummer, Wolfskehl, Gödel, Turing, Shimura, Taniyama, and Andrew Wiles. These are not the only ones, of course, but the most outstanding for me from this book. I want to make a special mention to the part where Singh talks about the work of women that were mathematicians. Even as of today, there aren’t many of us women dedicated to numbers or number theory, but we have come to a time when we can actually pursue this career, despite the struggles and obstacles that still exist in our societies. But being a mathematician a few centuries ago was completely outrageous and out of this world! Sophie Germain had to study secretly at night and keep a secret stock of candles to do so, because her dad used to confiscate them to prevent her from studying. Or Agnesi who was referred to as the “witch of Agnesi”. And the most extreme of these was Hypatia of Alexandria who suffered the most tragic and brutal death to the hands of the exulted mob led by the patriarch of Alexandria because she was considered a heretic. These stories really moved me and I’m very glad that their names are remembered and admired although they did not have a voice in their own time. Their only voice was their endless curiosity and passion for trying to understand the Universe and their brilliant work pervaded through history and remained printed in our books and forever in our memories, a greatly deserved honor to inspire all of us. And back to Fermat’s Theorem, Wiles amazing work on his childhood’s dream inspired this book and will hopefully inspire many more that see the beauty of numbers to keep working and pushing the frontiers on this science field which Singh perfectly describes as the “language of nature”."
48,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25904341-vignesh-ramanathan,5,"A very nice read detailing the incredible journey behind the solution of this theorem. My only gripe with this book is that the author tries to push a narrative a little too hard and tends to over-dramatize certain details. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable mathematical journey. Simon Singh has done well to make the book accessible and not overtly mathematical and confusing to read."

The story starts with Andrew Wiles who brought an end to this endless wait. But the span of the story is far far larger. Love stories, tragedies, moments of brilliances, moments of inspiration, moments of chance all intertwined in a marvellous way to solve this enigma. Did Fermat really have a foolproof proof? If he had it with the tools available at his time, then it still remains an enigma. Simon Singh brings to us this wonderful story in a brilliant way. "
50,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"Reading this book I caught a glimpse of the rarefied atmosphere of mathematicians and their processes of discovery. I don't do mathematics and haven't studied anything beyond the bare minimum required for a Bachelor's degree, but I find something wonderful about the pursuits of people like Andrew Wiles and the number theorists who spend years of their lives working on a set of problems. Wiles's obsessive mindset and solitary quest reminded of Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season"" and I wonder if Carlson read this or another account of Wiles's eight-year project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem? (From ""Towel Season"":)When they were dating, he'd begun to try to explain his work to her in metaphors, and she'd continued the game through his career, asking him for comparisons that she'd then inhabit, embellish. Right after they were married and Edison was in graduate school, he'd work late into the night in their apartment and crawl into bed with the calculations still percolating in his head. ""What's it like?"" Leslie would ask. ""Where are you now?"" She could tell he was remote, lit. They talked in territories.""I've crossed all the open ground, and the wind has stopped now. My hope is to find a way through this next place.""""Mountains?""""Right. Okay, mountains--blank, very few markings."" He spoke carefully and with a quiet zeal. ""They're steep, hard to see.""""Is it cold?""""No, but it is strange. It's quiet."" Then he'd turn to her in bed, his eyes bright, alive. ""I'm way past the path. I don't think anyone has climbed this route before. There are no trails, handholds.""Leslie would smile and kiss him in that close proximity. ""Keep going,"" she'd say. ""Halfway up that mountain, there's a woman with a cappuccino cart and a chicken-salad sandwich--me.""Then a smile would break across his face, too, and he would see her, kiss her back, and say it: ""Right. You.""A book has yet to fulfill my odd wish to peek over the shoulder of a mathematician working on a problem like Fermat's Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. Until a science writer like Singh explained it in metaphors and broad concepts I wouldn't understand what the mathematician was doing, but wouldn't it be weirdly magical to observe!"

The narration flows like acetone. The book starts with the climax moment of a 358 year old struggle “Fermat's last theorem”. Singh's writing style paints the whole view (awestruck people, ecstatic protagonist, exuberant surroundings) in front of your eyes. Singh is successful in seizing reader's undivided attention when he recounts the moment when the seed of this curiosity was sown in 10yr. old Wile's mind. And then, starts the roller coaster ride of the great minds who faced the thunderstorms and sunshine in Mathematical history. This book is no less than a time travel machine, which takes us to the ancient Egypt where this beguiling discipline spent its babyhood . Then the journey proceeds era by era, riddle by riddle from 3000 BC to the auspicious day when Wiles finally bid adieu to his childhood dream. Before I could even realize, I was already there with the great mathematicians, feeling the euphoria of slaughtering a puzzle, the frustration of long struggles, standing against the whole world for the love of Mathematics. Reading experience is elevated 1000 folds by the introduction of small mathematical teasers in between the chapters, when a highly motivated mathematician hidden in you will jump to iron it out. Singh takes us through the history of Mathematics related to FLT chronologically depicting many interesting stories. By the time you reach the ending, you are so engrossed in this world that you can experience the pain in the predicaments faced by Andrew Wiles. You will be able to empathize with the setbacks, hopes and tussles Wiles faced when his childhood dream was about to shatter after making it almost there!Best part of the book is “The return of Wiles”, the scenes from “The Dark Knight Rises” running alongside in my mind. One real life example of the victory of the “Never say die” doctrine. Truly mentioned in Daily Mail - “story of an obsessive love affair”!A must read for every enigma lover!"

Unfortunately, so was this book and my quest continues. Nonetheless, this book is very interesting and well written, and shows you how many things that appear to be simple and almost intuitive can be incredibly complex (that's what's so beautiful about math). In situations like this, people always tend to give all the praise to people like Andrew Wiles, without realizing on how much work and discoveries made by other people his work relies on. And even though Wiles deserves all the fame and recognition he can get for his persistence and determination, it's nice to see all the other great mathematicians who greatly contributed being mentioned. Like old saying goes: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes, and if anything, by showing how complex the proof is, it leaves you wondering, did the Fermat really have the solution?If you are only slightly interested in mathematics and were just curious about this certain topic and ideas on which the proof was based on, or are looking for a good place to start, I would definitively recommend this book. But to be fair, you can get all of that by watching previously mentioned documentary and it would cost you much less time. On the other hand, if you want something more complex and mathematical, you won't get it here."

It conveys perfectly to a layman the sense of accomplishment that the mathematical community associates with cracking the proof for this theorem. In that sense, it has the effect of a self-help book even without trying to be one."
57,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299698-pawan,5,"http://iandbooks.wordpress.comIn a way this book “Fermat’s Last Theorem” is a fantasy come true. To be able to read about complex Mathematics in a story book style is something that was possible only in this book by Simon Singh. Before I picked up this book I had no idea about Fermat’s last theorem or its significance. I just read the summary on the back page and felt like picking up the book and once I started reading it, there was no stopping it, though I did skipped over complex mathematical equations part.Fermat’s last theorem states that no set of positive three integers exist such thatan + bn = cnis satisfied for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and he claimed in his writing that he had a proof of this theorem but he did not have space left on the paper on which he was writing at that time. After his death hundreds of Mathematicians across the world tried unsuccessfully for many centuries to get the generic proof but the final proof was found only in 1995. Even though the proof has been found it is based on very complex mathematical models that were not in existence during Fermat’s time. So, it is still a mystery, how Fermat had that proof that was very simple.The book traces this history of Fermat’s last theorem. It is a fascinating story of how the best minds could not figure out something that was done by Fermat such a long time ago. The significance of this theorem is not that it brings some new understanding to the world of Mathematics but lies in the simplicity of the theorem and exceedingly complex proof of it."

The book explains and shows why math is so amazing, how it is a divine language that describes something (i.e., number properties and their relationships) that exists outside of the physical world, how mathematicians are then often more in search of a truth in the real sense of the word than in search of a practical application or an explanation, how math discoveries can be magical and fulfilling and immortal in that they are untouched by human perception. My heart literally started beating faster when I saw the published first page of the proof. The book does a great job of conveying a narrative arc and giving background when necessary, and in presenting a pretty complicated topic in an accessible but not-dumbed down way. (Although in the U.S. the title of the book was changed to “Fermat’s Enigma,"" sigh.)Also, quite charmingly, one of the major turning points in the book is a conversation at Cafe Strada in which someone exclaims, “But don’t you see? You’ve done it! All you have to do is add some gamma-zero of (M) structure and just run through your argument and it works. It gives you everything you need.”I learned that mathematicians are big weirdos, and that they like to chat each other up at tea every day. I also learned that 10^10^10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics.”Thanks for the rec Sue!"
59,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"The book is a quick read. There is just enough information in it for a layman to know sufficiently about the Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof to be able to boast at a coffee table discussion with friends. And that's all.While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the poof of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view that is sometimes a bit arguable and of course oversimplified. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably. Trying to condense the basic ideas of the comprehensive proof that only few top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. Still I feel that the essence should have been in the math, but the reader gets instead a inspiring story, about a man's zealous quest for an absolute truth."
60,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Simon Singh has the ability to present a story about a mathematics problem, and tell it like a detective story. He makes the subject exciting, even though the outcome is well known. Singh intersperses history with discussions about the mathematics, and makes it quite understandable. Singh starts with the roots of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, by recounting the stories and mathematics of Pythagoras, Euclid, and Euler. Other, less well-known mathematicians are also given credit, for example Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin Cauchy, and Evariste Galois. Three hundred fifty years ago, Fermat wrote the following theorem in the margin of a mathematics book:  And, Fermat wrote that he had a marvelous proof, but no room in the margin for it. For centuries, mathematicians have attempted to prove the theorem, without success. It had been sort of a ""holy grail"" of mathematicians to prove the theorem, and many brilliant minds spent years on it. Perhaps in was unprovable, and worst of all, Kurt Godel showed that some theorems are actually undecidable--that is to say, it is impossible even to decide whether or not a theorem is true.Singh recounts a fascinating story of the gifted mathematician, Paul Wolfskehl. He was very depressed, and decided to commit suicide on a particular night, at midnight. While waiting for that time to arrive, he started to read about the failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He became so engrossed in the subject, that he worked well past midnight. He found a gap in the logic of a predecessor, and was so proud of himself that he gained a new desire for life. And, in his will he established a fund of 100,000 marks to be given to the mathematician who first completes the proof of the theorem!Much of the book describes how Andrew Wiles developed a growing interest in the theorem. He worked in almost total isolation for seven years, in order not to be distracted. He occasionally published little tidbits unrelated to his real endeavor, in order to dispel suspicions about what his real work entailed.The central piece of the proof entailed proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, that linked modular forms with elliptic equations. This was a linkage between two far-flung branches of mathematics that seemed to be totally unrelated. To prove the conjecture would allow incredible advances to be made. And then, Ken Ribet showed that a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would, in effect, be a direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But many people tried and failed to develop the proof. But that is exactly what Andrew Wiles worked on for so many years.I had previously read that during Andrew Wiles' famous lecture, he just casually let the unsuspecting audience know, ""and that is a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."" Well, this book tells a somewhat different story. Most of the audience had heard rumors that the third of Wiles' lectures would be of historical significance. They came prepared with cameras, and took photographs during the lecture. So, it was a surprise, but not a total surprise.After Wiles' manuscript of the proof was sent to a publisher, six mathematicians reviewed it, and a crucial gap was found in it. Wiles worked furiously for a nightmarish year, and with the help of Richard Taylor, finally closed the gap. Today, Wiles is recognized as the one who developed the proof. But it is clear, that Wiles ""stood on the shoulders of giants""; he used--and developed--mathematical techniques that had not existed just a few decades previously.Simon Singh writes with a wonderful style. It is clear, not too jargon-heavy but contains enough mathematical ""meat"" to seem satisfying. The book is followed by ten appendixes that contain more details about some of the mathematics; they are not overly technical, and give the reader a better understanding of some of the issues. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in math. "
61,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"Before delving into the book itself, I thought I’d start things off by introducing the problem it’s concerned with, just in case you aren’t already familiar with it.So, what exactly is Fermat’s Last Theorem? Well, basically, this is it: As you can see, the conjecture is quite easy to understand, and yet, believe it or not, it was so remarkably difficult to prove that it took over 350 years to accomplish! The fact that Fermat (teasingly?) scribbled this rather infuriating note in the margin only added to the frustration felt by the scores of mathematicians who did battle with it over the centuries: “I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.”No doubt the cheeky bastard would’ve enjoyed Twitter:Okay, now that that’s been taken care of, it’s time to look at the actual book.What Kind of Book is Fermat’s Enigma?Simply put, Fermat’s Enigma is a history book. It is most definitely NOT a math book, so don’t expect to find any degree of mathematical rigor or complexity here. There are a handful of fairly simple proofs included in the appendices, but overall, the concepts under discussion are glossed over in a superficial manner, never examined in any kind of detail. If you want something that fleshes out how the proof actually works, I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere. (Singh was kind enough to include quite a few “further reading suggestions” at the end of this book. While I’ve not looked into any of the titles he recommended, I assume many of those might prove more to your liking if you prefer a “math book” on the subject.)In any case, while Singh did not pursue the actual mathematics in any real sense, he did positively excel at telling the story of an utterly fascinating struggle, one which spanned hundreds of years and ensnared countless brilliant, talented minds. Readers make the acquaintance of such notable mathematicians as Pythagoras (whose work paved the way for Fermat), Leonhard Euler, Paul Wolfskehl, Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Evariste Galois, Yutaka Taniyama, Goro Shimura, and of course Andrew Wiles, the man, the myth, the legend who finally proved the damn thing. Overall, I was surprised and delighted by just how compelling the story actually was. For me, this book quickly became a veritable page-turner, one I was loathe to put aside. Some may argue that in order to accomplish this, he omitted too much relevant information, that he sacrificed depth for readability. Perhaps this is true to an extent, but in my opinion, while it was admittedly easy to read and follow, it still managed to include a fair amount of pertinent, interesting material. More importantly, it never got bogged down with unnecessary details or lost in minutiae, and never meandered down exasperating tangents, as many otherwise outstanding history books are wont to do. And ultimately, what made this book so very stimulating was that the manner in which the story was told really made it come alive. Singh bestowed a truly suspenseful, exciting quest upon the reader, one full of twists and turns, and even *gasp* its fair share of drama. He enthusiastically demonstrated just how action-packed and exhilarating the life of the mind can be. And for accomplishing this tremendous feat, I heartily recommend the book, warts and all.And Now, For a Few Words on the Star of the ShowAndrew Wiles is an extraordinary human being. Fascinated by Fermat’s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, he vowed to conquer that most impossible of proofs. This was at the age of ten, mind you. I seriously can’t get past that. And then, true to his word, the little rascal grew up to become an eminent mathematician, one who finally went into seclusion for seven years in order to hack away at this tremendous proof. While a not insignificant error marred the first release of said proof, he didn’t let that deter him, but persevered and managed to rectify the error, and, within a couple of years, came out with THE proof. Holy goddamn shit. To me, Wiles’ story was completely and utterly inspiring. I was frankly amazed by what the human mind can achieve; I think I will always be in awe of Wiles’ fierce determination and incredible tenacity. Mad respect. Anyway, as you can probably tell, Andrew Wiles is a personal hero of mine. He is an undeniable, ultimate badass. Wayne and Garth said it best:"
62,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64969574-barry-cunningham,5,"Being a scientist of long standing and loving all aspects of science and maths, Fermat's Last Theorem in itself was a wonderful mystery, what I would give to see Fermat's note book with a note in the margin about cubic numbers as opposed to squares. A very trite remark, too lengthy to write in the margin so it is elsewhere, and no one has ever found it or managed to prove his statement, until - - - this book is a brilliant read, you would think it would be as dry as dust, but no! It is a superb account of the proof of the last theorem from Fermat's notebook to be proven. The only thing that still niggles at me, although the mathematical proof is fabulous, it uses modern techniques not available to Fermat, so it is proven but how the hell did Fermat do it??????A brilliant book, beautifully written a tremendous historical question answered in a very modern way, fabulous, well done for readability."

It gives you an epic scope of the number of minds that it takes to build new ideas. I doubt if Fermat had actually solved this theorem correctly, but this is impossible to prove. Fermat's theorem however was not impossible to prove! It was solved! Thanks to the efforts of many men (and women!) over many lifetimes and one final man who had the determination and persistence to finish the unthinkable. This book has a lot of wonderful elements, and really exemplifies a love of mathematics. Although if you want to actually understand the theorem this book may not be for you! I can honestly say reading it did not put the theorem in any more digestible light than it started out with. Perhaps it was to the authors advantage to skip the technicalities and focus on the enjoyment of the journey. I personally loved this approach, but it may not be for everyone, especially if you are actually looking to understand the theorem (a massive undertaking that is really not in my repertoire to comment on). "
66,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"What a fun book this was (thanks, Trevor, for the recommendation)! There are many reasons I think I like (good) nonfiction -- a sense of direct relevance, gravitas, frequent insights into the workings of the universe (and people), but mostly for knowledge narcs -- high levels of information density served up into an intriguing package by someone else who has undertaken the heavy lifting (research, organization, thinking). So, here in Singh's work I get a solid lay understanding not only of the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem, but of much of mathematics (and the lives of mathematicians) since the seventeenth century.I've been thinking also about what attracts me to books on mathematical topics -- the works by Martin Gardner, William Poundstone, and the various other authors in the company of whose thoughts I've had pleasure to spend a week or more. What I've come away with, is that the best of them feed off surprises, those bits of counterintuitive anecdotes that leave you blurting out, ""Huh. How about that,"" and then looking madly around for someone to tell. Like a book of jokes, riddles, or puzzles that provides immediate gratification in the back of the book, Fermat's Enigma plugs at least ten conundrums (and their easy-to-understand, logical solutions) into its appendices. For example -- say you're unlucky enough to be forced into a three-way duel. If everyone gets to take turns in order of their skill such that worst shoots first, what should the worst do? Aim at the best in the hopes of getting lucky and eliminating the most dangerous gunsel? Nope, the correct answer is to pass up the turn in the hopes that your first shot will get to be expended against only one remaining combatant. That way, even if you miss, you at least had a chance to take aim at the only person able to shoot back.Pierre Fermat turns out to have been quite the prankster, often tweaking professional mathematicians and academics by mailing them problems they knew full well he had already solved. For those who don't keep this type of trivia at the forefront of their brains, Fermat's the French recluse (and hanging circuit jurist) who once famously scribbled in a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica that x^n + y^n ≠ z^n for any number n greater than 2, a propostion for which he had ""a truly marvelous demonstration… which this margin is too narrow to contain."" This gets to be Fermat's Last Theorem, simply because it ends up being the last of his conundrums to be proven (not necessarily the last one he wrote). Just think, were it not for the scrupulous care taken by Fermat's son to go through and publish all of Fermat, Sr.'s writings, the world would not have been tantalized by this particular gem for 
over 350 YEARS
.Andrew Wiles published the first (and only?) proof in 1994, and Enigma does a tremendous job of walking the reader through not only the stunning depth of his intellectual achievement, but its significance as well. Suffice it to say that I was happy here to read that Taniyama-Shimura get their well-earned due and that modular and elliptical equations can finally be understood to be mathematically analogous (whether or not I have any idea what modular equations actually are). Still, all of this leads to what I think is an even more tantalizing problem. We now know that all of Fermat's conjectures ultimately proved to be solvable and that Fermat's own notes would seem to indicate that he had indeed apparently found ways to solve each of them. But there is no doubt that Fermat's solution could not have relied on the up-to-the-minute maths Wiles employs over 200 pages. So if it was really the limitations of the margin and not of Fermat that inhibited publication… what was Fermat's proof?"
67,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Strap in, guys. I’m going to walk you through the history of how Fermat’s Last Theorum was proved, all in one little (okay, big) review. And I can do this because of this awesome, semi-accessible, frequently tangent-taking, but mostly, this deeply fascinating book.----------STEP ONE: THE THEORUM----------For the unenlightened, Fermat’s Last Theorum is this: you probably know the Pythagorean theorum, a² + b² = c², which explains that if you square the shorter two sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, you get the value of third side squared. This is easily proved (that is, demonstrated to be completely, utterly, logically true via a mathematical proof, using axioms known to be true, which is just like a logic proof if you’ve done philosophy. Or a geometry proof, if you went to 9th grade). Take any triangle, and this will be true. There are infinite solutions to this equation—literally infinite values of A, B, and C which will render this solution true. However, Fermat discovered that the formula an + bn = cn where n > 2 has NO whole number solutions. (Go ahead, give it a whirl. I’ll wait).Then he challenged the mathematical community to create a mathematical proof demonstrating this must be true. While tantalizing them with the knowledge he’d already created a proof for this with a scribbled note in the margin of his notebook: “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Asshole. So sparked centuries of people trying to write this proof, to no avail. Until Professor Andrew Wiles (who has the most apropos name ever—he has wiles indeed) of Cambridge, in 1993.***For clarity, this is Fermat’s Equation (which I’ll refer to as FE): an + bn = cn where n > 2And THIS is Fermat’s Last Theorum (which I’ll refer to as FLT): “There are no solutions to Fermat’s Equation”***----------TANGENT: GODEL----------At this point, it’s been assumed that math is logically perfect—that if you correctly build a proof using axioms (like m + n = n + m), it must be true (and if it’s proven to be true, nothing can prove it to be false). This is known as “axiomatic set theory.” Along came Godel (who is analyzed to death by my beloved, Doug Hofstadter- see here and here). His ideas are as follows: 1. If axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there have to be theorems that can’t be proved or disproved. Why? Because of paradoxes. Godel translated the following statement into mathematical notation: “This statement has no proof.” If that’s false, then you COULD create a proof for that statement—however, that would make the statement false, so how could you have a proof for that? So it has to be true. But if it’s true, it can’t be proved because that’s what it literally says. It’s a mathematical statement that is true, but could never be proved to be true (an “undecidable statement”). 2. There’s no way to prove that axiomatic set theory is consistent; in a way, it’s one of those “undecidable statement” that’s true but can’t be proved to be true. Interestingly, this parallels the physicist Heisenberg’s discovery of the uncertainty principle, but we won’t get into that. Now, there aren’t very many of those undecidable statements. Godel couldn’t really point to any other undecidable statements besides the one above, so people assumed they were found only in the most extreme math and would probably never even be encountered. Welp. A young student named Paul Cohen at Stanford discovered a way to test whether a question is undecidable, and in doing so, discovered several more.Which sparked some fear in mathematicians. What if Fermat’s Last Theorum was undecidable?! What if they were wasting their time trying to prove the unprovable?Interestingly, if it were an undecidable statement, it couldn’t be proved—yet it would have to be true. The theorum says “there are no whole numbers to the equation an + bn = cn where n > 2.” If this were false, then it would be possible to prove this by offering a solution to this—by finding a whole number N that’s greater than 2 that allows the equation to be solved. Which would make it a decidable statement, which is a contradiction. So it can’t be false and also be an undecidable statement. In other words, Fermat’s Last Theorum might be totally true but there might be no way to prove it. ----------STEP TWO: TANIYAMA-SHIMURA CONJECTURE----------Modular forms are a mathematical tool, sort of like impossible forms or shapes, that reveal a lot about how numbers are related. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (TSC), created by two Japanese mathematicians (one of whom tragically and abruptly killed himself quite young) says every modular form is related to a specific elliptic equation (elliptic equations were Andrew Wiles’s main area of study; they’re a type of equation, not super important that you understand them). The fact that these were unified meant there’s a kind of Rosetta stone that’s been discovered: “Simple intuitions in the modular world translate into deep truths in the elliptic world, and vice versa. Very profound problems in the elliptic world can get solved sometimes by translating them using this Rosetta stone into the modular world, and discovering that we have the insights and tools in the modular world to treat the translated problem. Back in the elliptic world we would have been at a loss.”Beyond that awesomeness, the TSC suggests something even more interesting: that possibly all of mathematics, all the different worlds of mathematics, might have parallels in other worlds, as with the elliptic world and the modular world. All of mathematics might be unified—arguably the absolute ultimate goal of abstract mathematics, because this would give us the most complete picture, and the biggest arsenal of tools to solve mathematical problems. ----------STEP THREE: RIBET’S THEORUM----------This is all important for FLT because of something called Ribet’s Theorum (Ribet was a colleague of Wiles). Ribet’s Theorum goes like this: the imagined solution to FE can be translated into an elliptic equation. And that elliptic equation doesn’t seem to have a modular world equivalent. But the TSC claims that every elliptic equation must be related to a modular form. So if you can PROVE that the elliptic form of the solution to FE has no modular form (which we can! The proof was done in 1986), the following is true: if the TSC is true (i.e. all elliptic equations have modular forms), and the elliptic form of the imagined solution to FE has no modular form, then the imagined solution cannot exist, proving FLT. So now, all we have to do is prove that the TSC is true, and FLT is automatically proven to be true. And this—THIS—is what Andrew Wiles focused on. Proving the TSC (Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture).----------STEP FOUR: PROVING THE THEORUM----------Wiles finally succeeded when he applied a new method called the Kolyvagin-Flach method, which groups elliptic equations into families and then proves that an elliptic equation in that family has a modular form; if that elliptic equation has a modular form, then all other elliptic equations in that family also has a modular form. However, the Kolyvagin-Flach method has to be adapted for each family of elliptic equations. Wiles successfully adapted the method for all families of elliptic equations, thereby proving that all elliptic equations have modular forms (which, as a reminder, is basis of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and proving the TSC proves FLT). Two months before I was born, in 1993, he proved FLT in a series of 3 lectures. Kinda. Actually, there was a minor flaw in his proof (essentially, he might have failed to properly adapt the Kolyvagin-Flach method for some of the families of equations) but it doesn’t really matter because a year later, Wiles published a work-around to that flaw, so he proved FLT once and for all. ----------CONCLUSION----------All I can think about is: maybe if math looked like this, if THIS had been our material in high school—maybe then I wouldn’t have disliked it. Maybe other people wouldn’t, either. What a shoddy job we do teaching our children the wonder of learning."

Sounds dull. Except that the mathematician jots down that he has found this proof, but not what the proof is. And for hundredsd of years the greatest minds in mathematics have tried to find this simple proof and been beaten by the problem time and again.This really is a delightful book and one that gives an insight into how mathematicians think about the world. The proof of Pythagoras's theorem given in this book is so simple that the beauty of mathematical proof is made plain to everyone.

70,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,3,"I never watched any documentaries before going to college (and this was about a century and a half ago.. I am getting old -_-. But yeah, 2009 to be precise). I was always interested in NatGeo and History Channel - but they never showed the real deal on television. The documentaries would be mostly half assed, and at worst, total crap. That's also how Indian television landscape can be broadly categorized too, give or take a few exceptions ofcourse. And so I grew up loving the sciences based on what was taught in school curriculum, and elsewhere what I read on the slow 64-bit internet connection.And then college happened. Parents got me my own laptop - and the college intranet had a ton of stuff that other students shared. That place and that time - was where my love for documentaries was born. I had never been so fascinated with anything before. And the first two that I watched - in a long line of them - were Einstein's Biggest Blunder and BBC's Fermat's Last Theorem. The memory of that sunday afternoon is still pretty fresh. Back then, I only had a casual interest in astronomy and cosmology, and Einstein's theories were still something exotic. And so I basically understood jackshit from the first documentary. Even more intrigued than before, I started the second one. Fermat's Last Theorem was much more relatable - I had known the theorem, and understood the concept too. Years later when I joined goodreads, I found out that there was a book too. Keeping in with the tradition of firsts, it became the first book on my TBR pile too. Where it stayed until a few days ago - and I finally marked it as read last night. To be honest, this isn't the greatest book ever. It isnt even Simon Singh's best, who delivered the goods the much better in Big Bang.

Although my maths education is probably little above average (a good O Level and a terrible A Level, after which I rallied somewhat to obtain a reasonable HNC maths module) it's //very// many years out of use and it's all I can do to add two numbers up in my head. Given that this book is about a problem that flummoxed the best mathematical minds in the world for over 350 years you'd be forgiven for putting this back on the shelf and choosing something a little simpler. Well, don't even try that... YOU DON'T NEED ANY MATHS TO READ THIS! What Singh has done here is to present a hugely complex subject in a hugely entertaining way. The search for the answer to Fermat's riddle reads like a detective story and not a matehematical treatise and it includes a truly absorbing potted history of the development of maths over the years and, from Pythagoras to Fermat to Godel to Wiles, each part has a fascinating human side to it. Budding mathematicians needn't feel left out as the mechanics of the maths is also included, but it's treated in a gentle way: each step of the problem (and it's solution) is described in a simplified (but certainly not dumbed down) manner and some simple exercises are included in several short appendices. However, take heart! There are several places where elements of the maths are obviously too complex for us mortals and Singh is not afraid to say soo and then gloss over them completely. That may be a disappointment to some, but it's not at all unreasonable in my opinion. All in all, the net result is a book that is sensitive to its readers, intelligent, interesting and important. It's literally unputdownable and it had the added bonus of tricking me into thinking that I'm a little cleverer than I really am. I notice there's an inevitable Wills and Kate bio on the bestseller list at the moment. Put your hard earned cash into Andrew Morton's pockets or read something that will make you feel like a genius.

The intrigue, mystery, and drama surrounding the famous theorem without a proof (but that Fermat had said he had a proof for, just not enough space to write it in the margins) is exciting enough. All the math greats who have attempted to solve it but come up a little short, or a lot short.But it's much more than that, since the final proof of Fermat's Theorem involves so many other math concepts. This book starts and ends with Fermat, but in the middle it is more like a grand tour of all the mathematical developments that make the proof even possible. It's interesting to read about all the different dead ends and other productive findings (that had tangentially made it a little more possible to solve Fermat, but whose main contribution was in some other area). Also, reading about Galois's amazing life always makes me giddy. I mean, I've read about him before, but his story is just so crazy--math genius turned revolutionary thrown in jail involved in affair ends in duel, scribbles out his last thoughts the night before he dies... amazing.But don't expect to understand how the proof actually works by the end. The proof itself is over 100 pages, so there is no way a normal non-math genius can understand it. But you will get a general idea of the approach/trajectory/style of the final beast. Also, some of the math concepts leading up to it are quite easily comprehensible. I wouldn't recommend this book to a math whiz... it's more of a fun read for the layperson.It would ultimately be more satisfying if the proof were a short elegant thing that didn't involve latest groundbreaking discoveries in math. But maybe the bright side is that we can still wonder about Fermat's original (alleged) proof that was never written down. It had to be different from Andrew Wile's proof; does it exist? Or was Fermat bluffing? Or did he make an error in his proof?"
74,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962158-rakesh-m,5,"This book is a biography of the epic quest to solve the eluding Fermat's last theorem. It chronicles the life and works of not just Fermat, but most of the mathematicians having even a tiny bit to do with the conjecture/theorem. Curious and strange revelations into the lives of many of the princes and princesses of mathematics are presented. It presents the case of lives, pursuits and the times that they lived in. The problems that they face (mathematical and others), how these affect the progress/decline of the field. Simon Singh writes brilliantly mixing accounts of math behind the problem along with the lives of these mathematicians. We get to see accounts of love, suicides, suicide averted by fixating on a proof, duels and revolutionaries. For me it was shocking to know, that it was not just the kings and religious fellows destroying these geniuses and their sanctuaries, but Pythagoras also committed a grave mistake once, sentencing Hippasus to death for arguing that sqrt(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction!A must read for those interested in history behind the problem."

76,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8700554-hariprasad,4,"Simon Singh gives an excellent account of the quest for the solution to Fermat's puzzle. Starting off with ancient Greeks and arriving at the proof using modern mathematics, he explains the struggles of generations of mathematicians. The author never tries to overwhelm us with the mathematics, but tells us about the people who were involved in proving the theorem. Having said that, all the mathematics in the book can be understood with a background in high school mathematics. This book is a great read simply because of the intellectual achievement that it talks about. Strongly recommended if you're remotely interested in mathematics."
77,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"I have a special love for words. I think I always have. They’re fascinating. The words in this book were used for telling a story about numbers, which made me realize I also love numbers so much, I just didn’t know. Math had always been the “easy subject” at school for me, the one which did not require long hours of study, because it was so logical, the one you could check before turning in an exam and know you had the right answers precisely because it matched so perfectly. “Proof is what lies at the heart of maths.”, indeed, so simple, so beautiful. Well, this story is, as the title describes, a true quest to solve one of the most difficult problems in Mathematics which Fermat’s Last Theorem used to be. Simon Singh did this superbly. He is absolutely great at explaining from whole numbers and 1+1 to elliptical equations and modular forms. But the best was to learn about some of the greatest minds that worked so hard in the last century solving problems and doing the maths that have been the basis and tool for proving this theorem and thus, their great contribution to science: Pythagoras and his controversial Pythagorean Brotherhood, Mersenne, Euclid, Diophantus and his most remarkable “Arithmetica”, of course Pierre de Fermat, Pascal, brilliant Euler, Cantor, Sophie Germain, Theano, Hypatia, Maria Agnesi, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Cauchy, Lamè, Kummer, Wolfskehl, Gödel, Turing, Shimura, Taniyama, and Andrew Wiles. These are not the only ones, of course, but the most outstanding for me from this book. I want to make a special mention to the part where Singh talks about the work of women that were mathematicians. Even as of today, there aren’t many of us women dedicated to numbers or number theory, but we have come to a time when we can actually pursue this career, despite the struggles and obstacles that still exist in our societies. But being a mathematician a few centuries ago was completely outrageous and out of this world! Sophie Germain had to study secretly at night and keep a secret stock of candles to do so, because her dad used to confiscate them to prevent her from studying. Or Agnesi who was referred to as the “witch of Agnesi”. And the most extreme of these was Hypatia of Alexandria who suffered the most tragic and brutal death to the hands of the exulted mob led by the patriarch of Alexandria because she was considered a heretic. These stories really moved me and I’m very glad that their names are remembered and admired although they did not have a voice in their own time. Their only voice was their endless curiosity and passion for trying to understand the Universe and their brilliant work pervaded through history and remained printed in our books and forever in our memories, a greatly deserved honor to inspire all of us. And back to Fermat’s Theorem, Wiles amazing work on his childhood’s dream inspired this book and will hopefully inspire many more that see the beauty of numbers to keep working and pushing the frontiers on this science field which Singh perfectly describes as the “language of nature”."
78,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25904341-vignesh-ramanathan,5,"A very nice read detailing the incredible journey behind the solution of this theorem. My only gripe with this book is that the author tries to push a narrative a little too hard and tends to over-dramatize certain details. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable mathematical journey. Simon Singh has done well to make the book accessible and not overtly mathematical and confusing to read."

The story starts with Andrew Wiles who brought an end to this endless wait. But the span of the story is far far larger. Love stories, tragedies, moments of brilliances, moments of inspiration, moments of chance all intertwined in a marvellous way to solve this enigma. Did Fermat really have a foolproof proof? If he had it with the tools available at his time, then it still remains an enigma. Simon Singh brings to us this wonderful story in a brilliant way. "
80,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"Reading this book I caught a glimpse of the rarefied atmosphere of mathematicians and their processes of discovery. I don't do mathematics and haven't studied anything beyond the bare minimum required for a Bachelor's degree, but I find something wonderful about the pursuits of people like Andrew Wiles and the number theorists who spend years of their lives working on a set of problems. Wiles's obsessive mindset and solitary quest reminded of Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season"" and I wonder if Carlson read this or another account of Wiles's eight-year project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem? (From ""Towel Season"":)When they were dating, he'd begun to try to explain his work to her in metaphors, and she'd continued the game through his career, asking him for comparisons that she'd then inhabit, embellish. Right after they were married and Edison was in graduate school, he'd work late into the night in their apartment and crawl into bed with the calculations still percolating in his head. ""What's it like?"" Leslie would ask. ""Where are you now?"" She could tell he was remote, lit. They talked in territories.""I've crossed all the open ground, and the wind has stopped now. My hope is to find a way through this next place.""""Mountains?""""Right. Okay, mountains--blank, very few markings."" He spoke carefully and with a quiet zeal. ""They're steep, hard to see.""""Is it cold?""""No, but it is strange. It's quiet."" Then he'd turn to her in bed, his eyes bright, alive. ""I'm way past the path. I don't think anyone has climbed this route before. There are no trails, handholds.""Leslie would smile and kiss him in that close proximity. ""Keep going,"" she'd say. ""Halfway up that mountain, there's a woman with a cappuccino cart and a chicken-salad sandwich--me.""Then a smile would break across his face, too, and he would see her, kiss her back, and say it: ""Right. You.""A book has yet to fulfill my odd wish to peek over the shoulder of a mathematician working on a problem like Fermat's Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. Until a science writer like Singh explained it in metaphors and broad concepts I wouldn't understand what the mathematician was doing, but wouldn't it be weirdly magical to observe!"

I think that what I liked the most about this book is that I was actually able to understand a good sixty percent of it. With the other forty percent, I proceeded on faith. Come to think of it, those percentages hold true for the rest of my life. There are times when your best bet is to find a good math book. Two plus two is four.

83,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"well, the main thing i took from this book is probably that maths is a field for privileged white men. you have to be rich enough to be able to live comfortably while devoting their life to solving a centuries-old problem simply because they think proving it would be ""satisfying"". you must also be white - or at least living in the west - so that you are actually recognized for your work, otherwise your work will be spotted by someone who lives in the west who will take credit for it. and you must be male. obviously. the politics of the world of mathematics is interesting stuff folks. anyway, it's an alright book. very informative n clear (most of the time). also pretty funny. although i would recommend the 1st half of the book to pretty much anyone, it does sort of get a bit jargon-y and vague by the end. i still enjoyed it, but not at much as i did the first half. i did find the lack of dates for all the events a bit annoying. singh often jumped from event to event, without giving his readers a very good timeline of happenings. aaaanyway. i still learnt a lot from this book. and it's very engaging. if you're interested at all in the history of mathematics, i would definitely recommend. it doesn't really tell you how to solve fermat's last theorem (you'd have to read a 200 page paper to find out sorry), but it gives you a pretty good overview of how mathematicians collectively got there. while also including a couple maths puzzles and a collection of proofs in the back <3 (i love proofs)"
84,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10375644-akanksha,5,"Most interesting non-fiction book I have ever read.Simon Singh's style of weaving a scientific concept into a beautiful story leaves no occasion for the fictional characters and plots. The narration flows like acetone. The book starts with the climax moment of a 358 year old struggle “Fermat's last theorem”. Singh's writing style paints the whole view (awestruck people, ecstatic protagonist, exuberant surroundings) in front of your eyes. Singh is successful in seizing reader's undivided attention when he recounts the moment when the seed of this curiosity was sown in 10yr. old Wile's mind. And then, starts the roller coaster ride of the great minds who faced the thunderstorms and sunshine in Mathematical history. This book is no less than a time travel machine, which takes us to the ancient Egypt where this beguiling discipline spent its babyhood . Then the journey proceeds era by era, riddle by riddle from 3000 BC to the auspicious day when Wiles finally bid adieu to his childhood dream. Before I could even realize, I was already there with the great mathematicians, feeling the euphoria of slaughtering a puzzle, the frustration of long struggles, standing against the whole world for the love of Mathematics. Reading experience is elevated 1000 folds by the introduction of small mathematical teasers in between the chapters, when a highly motivated mathematician hidden in you will jump to iron it out. Singh takes us through the history of Mathematics related to FLT chronologically depicting many interesting stories. By the time you reach the ending, you are so engrossed in this world that you can experience the pain in the predicaments faced by Andrew Wiles. You will be able to empathize with the setbacks, hopes and tussles Wiles faced when his childhood dream was about to shatter after making it almost there!Best part of the book is “The return of Wiles”, the scenes from “The Dark Knight Rises” running alongside in my mind. One real life example of the victory of the “Never say die” doctrine. Truly mentioned in Daily Mail - “story of an obsessive love affair”!A must read for every enigma lover!"

Unfortunately, so was this book and my quest continues. Nonetheless, this book is very interesting and well written, and shows you how many things that appear to be simple and almost intuitive can be incredibly complex (that's what's so beautiful about math). In situations like this, people always tend to give all the praise to people like Andrew Wiles, without realizing on how much work and discoveries made by other people his work relies on. And even though Wiles deserves all the fame and recognition he can get for his persistence and determination, it's nice to see all the other great mathematicians who greatly contributed being mentioned. Like old saying goes: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes, and if anything, by showing how complex the proof is, it leaves you wondering, did the Fermat really have the solution?If you are only slightly interested in mathematics and were just curious about this certain topic and ideas on which the proof was based on, or are looking for a good place to start, I would definitively recommend this book. But to be fair, you can get all of that by watching previously mentioned documentary and it would cost you much less time. On the other hand, if you want something more complex and mathematical, you won't get it here."
86,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35395038-amith,4,"This book finds a way to narrate the chain of events from the time of Pythagoras to the final proof of Fermat's last theorem by Andrew Wiles, entwining with it the key mathematical concepts presented in an accessible form and stories of the mathematicians who made those contributions. It conveys perfectly to a layman the sense of accomplishment that the mathematical community associates with cracking the proof for this theorem. In that sense, it has the effect of a self-help book even without trying to be one."
87,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299698-pawan,5,"http://iandbooks.wordpress.comIn a way this book “Fermat’s Last Theorem” is a fantasy come true. To be able to read about complex Mathematics in a story book style is something that was possible only in this book by Simon Singh. Before I picked up this book I had no idea about Fermat’s last theorem or its significance. I just read the summary on the back page and felt like picking up the book and once I started reading it, there was no stopping it, though I did skipped over complex mathematical equations part.Fermat’s last theorem states that no set of positive three integers exist such thatan + bn = cnis satisfied for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and he claimed in his writing that he had a proof of this theorem but he did not have space left on the paper on which he was writing at that time. After his death hundreds of Mathematicians across the world tried unsuccessfully for many centuries to get the generic proof but the final proof was found only in 1995. Even though the proof has been found it is based on very complex mathematical models that were not in existence during Fermat’s time. So, it is still a mystery, how Fermat had that proof that was very simple.The book traces this history of Fermat’s last theorem. It is a fascinating story of how the best minds could not figure out something that was done by Fermat such a long time ago. The significance of this theorem is not that it brings some new understanding to the world of Mathematics but lies in the simplicity of the theorem and exceedingly complex proof of it."
88,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance,5,"Absolutely fantastic.The descriptions of all the maths and discoveries in this book are nothing short of joyful, and I felt so excited to be reading all of it. The book explains and shows why math is so amazing, how it is a divine language that describes something (i.e., number properties and their relationships) that exists outside of the physical world, how mathematicians are then often more in search of a truth in the real sense of the word than in search of a practical application or an explanation, how math discoveries can be magical and fulfilling and immortal in that they are untouched by human perception. My heart literally started beating faster when I saw the published first page of the proof. The book does a great job of conveying a narrative arc and giving background when necessary, and in presenting a pretty complicated topic in an accessible but not-dumbed down way. (Although in the U.S. the title of the book was changed to “Fermat’s Enigma,"" sigh.)Also, quite charmingly, one of the major turning points in the book is a conversation at Cafe Strada in which someone exclaims, “But don’t you see? You’ve done it! All you have to do is add some gamma-zero of (M) structure and just run through your argument and it works. It gives you everything you need.”I learned that mathematicians are big weirdos, and that they like to chat each other up at tea every day. I also learned that 10^10^10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics.”Thanks for the rec Sue!"
89,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"The book is a quick read. There is just enough information in it for a layman to know sufficiently about the Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof to be able to boast at a coffee table discussion with friends. And that's all.While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the poof of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view that is sometimes a bit arguable and of course oversimplified. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably. Trying to condense the basic ideas of the comprehensive proof that only few top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. Still I feel that the essence should have been in the math, but the reader gets instead a inspiring story, about a man's zealous quest for an absolute truth."
90,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Simon Singh has the ability to present a story about a mathematics problem, and tell it like a detective story. He makes the subject exciting, even though the outcome is well known. Singh intersperses history with discussions about the mathematics, and makes it quite understandable. Singh starts with the roots of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, by recounting the stories and mathematics of Pythagoras, Euclid, and Euler. Other, less well-known mathematicians are also given credit, for example Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin Cauchy, and Evariste Galois. Three hundred fifty years ago, Fermat wrote the following theorem in the margin of a mathematics book:  And, Fermat wrote that he had a marvelous proof, but no room in the margin for it. For centuries, mathematicians have attempted to prove the theorem, without success. It had been sort of a ""holy grail"" of mathematicians to prove the theorem, and many brilliant minds spent years on it. Perhaps in was unprovable, and worst of all, Kurt Godel showed that some theorems are actually undecidable--that is to say, it is impossible even to decide whether or not a theorem is true.Singh recounts a fascinating story of the gifted mathematician, Paul Wolfskehl. He was very depressed, and decided to commit suicide on a particular night, at midnight. While waiting for that time to arrive, he started to read about the failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He became so engrossed in the subject, that he worked well past midnight. He found a gap in the logic of a predecessor, and was so proud of himself that he gained a new desire for life. And, in his will he established a fund of 100,000 marks to be given to the mathematician who first completes the proof of the theorem!Much of the book describes how Andrew Wiles developed a growing interest in the theorem. He worked in almost total isolation for seven years, in order not to be distracted. He occasionally published little tidbits unrelated to his real endeavor, in order to dispel suspicions about what his real work entailed.The central piece of the proof entailed proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, that linked modular forms with elliptic equations. This was a linkage between two far-flung branches of mathematics that seemed to be totally unrelated. To prove the conjecture would allow incredible advances to be made. And then, Ken Ribet showed that a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would, in effect, be a direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But many people tried and failed to develop the proof. But that is exactly what Andrew Wiles worked on for so many years.I had previously read that during Andrew Wiles' famous lecture, he just casually let the unsuspecting audience know, ""and that is a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."" Well, this book tells a somewhat different story. Most of the audience had heard rumors that the third of Wiles' lectures would be of historical significance. They came prepared with cameras, and took photographs during the lecture. So, it was a surprise, but not a total surprise.After Wiles' manuscript of the proof was sent to a publisher, six mathematicians reviewed it, and a crucial gap was found in it. Wiles worked furiously for a nightmarish year, and with the help of Richard Taylor, finally closed the gap. Today, Wiles is recognized as the one who developed the proof. But it is clear, that Wiles ""stood on the shoulders of giants""; he used--and developed--mathematical techniques that had not existed just a few decades previously.Simon Singh writes with a wonderful style. It is clear, not too jargon-heavy but contains enough mathematical ""meat"" to seem satisfying. The book is followed by ten appendixes that contain more details about some of the mathematics; they are not overly technical, and give the reader a better understanding of some of the issues. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in math. "
91,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"Before delving into the book itself, I thought I’d start things off by introducing the problem it’s concerned with, just in case you aren’t already familiar with it.So, what exactly is Fermat’s Last Theorem? Well, basically, this is it: As you can see, the conjecture is quite easy to understand, and yet, believe it or not, it was so remarkably difficult to prove that it took over 350 years to accomplish! The fact that Fermat (teasingly?) scribbled this rather infuriating note in the margin only added to the frustration felt by the scores of mathematicians who did battle with it over the centuries: “I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.”No doubt the cheeky bastard would’ve enjoyed Twitter:Okay, now that that’s been taken care of, it’s time to look at the actual book.What Kind of Book is Fermat’s Enigma?Simply put, Fermat’s Enigma is a history book. It is most definitely NOT a math book, so don’t expect to find any degree of mathematical rigor or complexity here. There are a handful of fairly simple proofs included in the appendices, but overall, the concepts under discussion are glossed over in a superficial manner, never examined in any kind of detail. If you want something that fleshes out how the proof actually works, I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere. (Singh was kind enough to include quite a few “further reading suggestions” at the end of this book. While I’ve not looked into any of the titles he recommended, I assume many of those might prove more to your liking if you prefer a “math book” on the subject.)In any case, while Singh did not pursue the actual mathematics in any real sense, he did positively excel at telling the story of an utterly fascinating struggle, one which spanned hundreds of years and ensnared countless brilliant, talented minds. Readers make the acquaintance of such notable mathematicians as Pythagoras (whose work paved the way for Fermat), Leonhard Euler, Paul Wolfskehl, Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Evariste Galois, Yutaka Taniyama, Goro Shimura, and of course Andrew Wiles, the man, the myth, the legend who finally proved the damn thing. Overall, I was surprised and delighted by just how compelling the story actually was. For me, this book quickly became a veritable page-turner, one I was loathe to put aside. Some may argue that in order to accomplish this, he omitted too much relevant information, that he sacrificed depth for readability. Perhaps this is true to an extent, but in my opinion, while it was admittedly easy to read and follow, it still managed to include a fair amount of pertinent, interesting material. More importantly, it never got bogged down with unnecessary details or lost in minutiae, and never meandered down exasperating tangents, as many otherwise outstanding history books are wont to do. And ultimately, what made this book so very stimulating was that the manner in which the story was told really made it come alive. Singh bestowed a truly suspenseful, exciting quest upon the reader, one full of twists and turns, and even *gasp* its fair share of drama. He enthusiastically demonstrated just how action-packed and exhilarating the life of the mind can be. And for accomplishing this tremendous feat, I heartily recommend the book, warts and all.And Now, For a Few Words on the Star of the ShowAndrew Wiles is an extraordinary human being. Fascinated by Fermat’s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, he vowed to conquer that most impossible of proofs. This was at the age of ten, mind you. I seriously can’t get past that. And then, true to his word, the little rascal grew up to become an eminent mathematician, one who finally went into seclusion for seven years in order to hack away at this tremendous proof. While a not insignificant error marred the first release of said proof, he didn’t let that deter him, but persevered and managed to rectify the error, and, within a couple of years, came out with THE proof. Holy goddamn shit. To me, Wiles’ story was completely and utterly inspiring. I was frankly amazed by what the human mind can achieve; I think I will always be in awe of Wiles’ fierce determination and incredible tenacity. Mad respect. Anyway, as you can probably tell, Andrew Wiles is a personal hero of mine. He is an undeniable, ultimate badass. Wayne and Garth said it best:"

A very trite remark, too lengthy to write in the margin so it is elsewhere, and no one has ever found it or managed to prove his statement, until - - - this book is a brilliant read, you would think it would be as dry as dust, but no! It is a superb account of the proof of the last theorem from Fermat's notebook to be proven. The only thing that still niggles at me, although the mathematical proof is fabulous, it uses modern techniques not available to Fermat, so it is proven but how the hell did Fermat do it??????A brilliant book, beautifully written a tremendous historical question answered in a very modern way, fabulous, well done for readability."

It gives you an epic scope of the number of minds that it takes to build new ideas. I doubt if Fermat had actually solved this theorem correctly, but this is impossible to prove. Fermat's theorem however was not impossible to prove! It was solved! Thanks to the efforts of many men (and women!) over many lifetimes and one final man who had the determination and persistence to finish the unthinkable. This book has a lot of wonderful elements, and really exemplifies a love of mathematics. Although if you want to actually understand the theorem this book may not be for you! I can honestly say reading it did not put the theorem in any more digestible light than it started out with. Perhaps it was to the authors advantage to skip the technicalities and focus on the enjoyment of the journey. I personally loved this approach, but it may not be for everyone, especially if you are actually looking to understand the theorem (a massive undertaking that is really not in my repertoire to comment on).

96,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"What a fun book this was (thanks, Trevor, for the recommendation)! There are many reasons I think I like (good) nonfiction -- a sense of direct relevance, gravitas, frequent insights into the workings of the universe (and people), but mostly for knowledge narcs -- high levels of information density served up into an intriguing package by someone else who has undertaken the heavy lifting (research, organization, thinking). So, here in Singh's work I get a solid lay understanding not only of the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem, but of much of mathematics (and the lives of mathematicians) since the seventeenth century.I've been thinking also about what attracts me to books on mathematical topics -- the works by Martin Gardner, William Poundstone, and the various other authors in the company of whose thoughts I've had pleasure to spend a week or more. What I've come away with, is that the best of them feed off surprises, those bits of counterintuitive anecdotes that leave you blurting out, ""Huh. How about that,"" and then looking madly around for someone to tell. Like a book of jokes, riddles, or puzzles that provides immediate gratification in the back of the book, Fermat's Enigma plugs at least ten conundrums (and their easy-to-understand, logical solutions) into its appendices. For example -- say you're unlucky enough to be forced into a three-way duel. If everyone gets to take turns in order of their skill such that worst shoots first, what should the worst do? Aim at the best in the hopes of getting lucky and eliminating the most dangerous gunsel? Nope, the correct answer is to pass up the turn in the hopes that your first shot will get to be expended against only one remaining combatant. That way, even if you miss, you at least had a chance to take aim at the only person able to shoot back.Pierre Fermat turns out to have been quite the prankster, often tweaking professional mathematicians and academics by mailing them problems they knew full well he had already solved. For those who don't keep this type of trivia at the forefront of their brains, Fermat's the French recluse (and hanging circuit jurist) who once famously scribbled in a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica that x^n + y^n ≠ z^n for any number n greater than 2, a propostion for which he had ""a truly marvelous demonstration… which this margin is too narrow to contain."" This gets to be Fermat's Last Theorem, simply because it ends up being the last of his conundrums to be proven (not necessarily the last one he wrote). Just think, were it not for the scrupulous care taken by Fermat's son to go through and publish all of Fermat, Sr.'s writings, the world would not have been tantalized by this particular gem for 
over 350 YEARS
.Andrew Wiles published the first (and only?) proof in 1994, and Enigma does a tremendous job of walking the reader through not only the stunning depth of his intellectual achievement, but its significance as well. Suffice it to say that I was happy here to read that Taniyama-Shimura get their well-earned due and that modular and elliptical equations can finally be understood to be mathematically analogous (whether or not I have any idea what modular equations actually are). Still, all of this leads to what I think is an even more tantalizing problem. We now know that all of Fermat's conjectures ultimately proved to be solvable and that Fermat's own notes would seem to indicate that he had indeed apparently found ways to solve each of them. But there is no doubt that Fermat's solution could not have relied on the up-to-the-minute maths Wiles employs over 200 pages. So if it was really the limitations of the margin and not of Fermat that inhibited publication… what was Fermat's proof?"
97,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Strap in, guys. I’m going to walk you through the history of how Fermat’s Last Theorum was proved, all in one little (okay, big) review. And I can do this because of this awesome, semi-accessible, frequently tangent-taking, but mostly, this deeply fascinating book.----------STEP ONE: THE THEORUM----------For the unenlightened, Fermat’s Last Theorum is this: you probably know the Pythagorean theorum, a² + b² = c², which explains that if you square the shorter two sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, you get the value of third side squared. This is easily proved (that is, demonstrated to be completely, utterly, logically true via a mathematical proof, using axioms known to be true, which is just like a logic proof if you’ve done philosophy. Or a geometry proof, if you went to 9th grade). Take any triangle, and this will be true. There are infinite solutions to this equation—literally infinite values of A, B, and C which will render this solution true. However, Fermat discovered that the formula an + bn = cn where n > 2 has NO whole number solutions. (Go ahead, give it a whirl. I’ll wait).Then he challenged the mathematical community to create a mathematical proof demonstrating this must be true. While tantalizing them with the knowledge he’d already created a proof for this with a scribbled note in the margin of his notebook: “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Asshole. So sparked centuries of people trying to write this proof, to no avail. Until Professor Andrew Wiles (who has the most apropos name ever—he has wiles indeed) of Cambridge, in 1993.***For clarity, this is Fermat’s Equation (which I’ll refer to as FE): an + bn = cn where n > 2And THIS is Fermat’s Last Theorum (which I’ll refer to as FLT): “There are no solutions to Fermat’s Equation”***----------TANGENT: GODEL----------At this point, it’s been assumed that math is logically perfect—that if you correctly build a proof using axioms (like m + n = n + m), it must be true (and if it’s proven to be true, nothing can prove it to be false). This is known as “axiomatic set theory.” Along came Godel (who is analyzed to death by my beloved, Doug Hofstadter- see here and here). His ideas are as follows: 1. If axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there have to be theorems that can’t be proved or disproved. Why? Because of paradoxes. Godel translated the following statement into mathematical notation: “This statement has no proof.” If that’s false, then you COULD create a proof for that statement—however, that would make the statement false, so how could you have a proof for that? So it has to be true. But if it’s true, it can’t be proved because that’s what it literally says. It’s a mathematical statement that is true, but could never be proved to be true (an “undecidable statement”). 2. There’s no way to prove that axiomatic set theory is consistent; in a way, it’s one of those “undecidable statement” that’s true but can’t be proved to be true. Interestingly, this parallels the physicist Heisenberg’s discovery of the uncertainty principle, but we won’t get into that. Now, there aren’t very many of those undecidable statements. Godel couldn’t really point to any other undecidable statements besides the one above, so people assumed they were found only in the most extreme math and would probably never even be encountered. Welp. A young student named Paul Cohen at Stanford discovered a way to test whether a question is undecidable, and in doing so, discovered several more.Which sparked some fear in mathematicians. What if Fermat’s Last Theorum was undecidable?! What if they were wasting their time trying to prove the unprovable?Interestingly, if it were an undecidable statement, it couldn’t be proved—yet it would have to be true. The theorum says “there are no whole numbers to the equation an + bn = cn where n > 2.” If this were false, then it would be possible to prove this by offering a solution to this—by finding a whole number N that’s greater than 2 that allows the equation to be solved. Which would make it a decidable statement, which is a contradiction. So it can’t be false and also be an undecidable statement. In other words, Fermat’s Last Theorum might be totally true but there might be no way to prove it. ----------STEP TWO: TANIYAMA-SHIMURA CONJECTURE----------Modular forms are a mathematical tool, sort of like impossible forms or shapes, that reveal a lot about how numbers are related. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (TSC), created by two Japanese mathematicians (one of whom tragically and abruptly killed himself quite young) says every modular form is related to a specific elliptic equation (elliptic equations were Andrew Wiles’s main area of study; they’re a type of equation, not super important that you understand them). The fact that these were unified meant there’s a kind of Rosetta stone that’s been discovered: “Simple intuitions in the modular world translate into deep truths in the elliptic world, and vice versa. Very profound problems in the elliptic world can get solved sometimes by translating them using this Rosetta stone into the modular world, and discovering that we have the insights and tools in the modular world to treat the translated problem. Back in the elliptic world we would have been at a loss.”Beyond that awesomeness, the TSC suggests something even more interesting: that possibly all of mathematics, all the different worlds of mathematics, might have parallels in other worlds, as with the elliptic world and the modular world. All of mathematics might be unified—arguably the absolute ultimate goal of abstract mathematics, because this would give us the most complete picture, and the biggest arsenal of tools to solve mathematical problems. ----------STEP THREE: RIBET’S THEORUM----------This is all important for FLT because of something called Ribet’s Theorum (Ribet was a colleague of Wiles). Ribet’s Theorum goes like this: the imagined solution to FE can be translated into an elliptic equation. And that elliptic equation doesn’t seem to have a modular world equivalent. But the TSC claims that every elliptic equation must be related to a modular form. So if you can PROVE that the elliptic form of the solution to FE has no modular form (which we can! The proof was done in 1986), the following is true: if the TSC is true (i.e. all elliptic equations have modular forms), and the elliptic form of the imagined solution to FE has no modular form, then the imagined solution cannot exist, proving FLT. So now, all we have to do is prove that the TSC is true, and FLT is automatically proven to be true. And this—THIS—is what Andrew Wiles focused on. Proving the TSC (Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture).----------STEP FOUR: PROVING THE THEORUM----------Wiles finally succeeded when he applied a new method called the Kolyvagin-Flach method, which groups elliptic equations into families and then proves that an elliptic equation in that family has a modular form; if that elliptic equation has a modular form, then all other elliptic equations in that family also has a modular form. However, the Kolyvagin-Flach method has to be adapted for each family of elliptic equations. Wiles successfully adapted the method for all families of elliptic equations, thereby proving that all elliptic equations have modular forms (which, as a reminder, is basis of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and proving the TSC proves FLT). Two months before I was born, in 1993, he proved FLT in a series of 3 lectures. Kinda. Actually, there was a minor flaw in his proof (essentially, he might have failed to properly adapt the Kolyvagin-Flach method for some of the families of equations) but it doesn’t really matter because a year later, Wiles published a work-around to that flaw, so he proved FLT once and for all. ----------CONCLUSION----------All I can think about is: maybe if math looked like this, if THIS had been our material in high school—maybe then I wouldn’t have disliked it. Maybe other people wouldn’t, either. What a shoddy job we do teaching our children the wonder of learning."
98,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This book is as interesting as a detective story while being about quite advanced mathematics - as such it is quite a book showing the remarkable skill of its writer to explain complex ideas in ways that are always readable and enjoyable.A mathematician finds a simple proof to what seems like a deceptively simple problem of mathematics - that pythagoras's theorem only works if the terms are squared, and not if they are any other power up to infinity. Sounds dull. Except that the mathematician jots down that he has found this proof, but not what the proof is. And for hundredsd of years the greatest minds in mathematics have tried to find this simple proof and been beaten by the problem time and again.This really is a delightful book and one that gives an insight into how mathematicians think about the world. The proof of Pythagoras's theorem given in this book is so simple that the beauty of mathematical proof is made plain to everyone. Just a little knowledge of algebra is needed for this part of the book - the rest requires no maths at all."

100,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,3,"I never watched any documentaries before going to college (and this was about a century and a half ago.. I am getting old -_-. But yeah, 2009 to be precise). I was always interested in NatGeo and History Channel - but they never showed the real deal on television. The documentaries would be mostly half assed, and at worst, total crap. That's also how Indian television landscape can be broadly categorized too, give or take a few exceptions ofcourse. And so I grew up loving the sciences based on what was taught in school curriculum, and elsewhere what I read on the slow 64-bit internet connection.And then college happened. Parents got me my own laptop - and the college intranet had a ton of stuff that other students shared. That place and that time - was where my love for documentaries was born. I had never been so fascinated with anything before. And the first two that I watched - in a long line of them - were Einstein's Biggest Blunder and BBC's Fermat's Last Theorem. The memory of that sunday afternoon is still pretty fresh. Back then, I only had a casual interest in astronomy and cosmology, and Einstein's theories were still something exotic. And so I basically understood jackshit from the first documentary. Even more intrigued than before, I started the second one. Fermat's Last Theorem was much more relatable - I had known the theorem, and understood the concept too. Years later when I joined goodreads, I found out that there was a book too. Keeping in with the tradition of firsts, it became the first book on my TBR pile too. Where it stayed until a few days ago - and I finally marked it as read last night. To be honest, this isn't the greatest book ever. It isnt even Simon Singh's best, who delivered the goods the much better in Big Bang. But it surely captures the essence of all mathematical and scientific endeavor very well - That every once in a while, in the middle of an ordinary life, science gives us a fairytale"
101,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,5,"If you buy the latest Jilly Cooper instead of this you WILL go to hell!This one languished on my bookshelf for the best part of a year as I was too scared to pick it up & start it. What held me back is what will probably put a lot of other potential readers off trying it - the boring old ""I'm no good at maths"" argument. Although my maths education is probably little above average (a good O Level and a terrible A Level, after which I rallied somewhat to obtain a reasonable HNC maths module) it's //very// many years out of use and it's all I can do to add two numbers up in my head. Given that this book is about a problem that flummoxed the best mathematical minds in the world for over 350 years you'd be forgiven for putting this back on the shelf and choosing something a little simpler. Well, don't even try that... YOU DON'T NEED ANY MATHS TO READ THIS! What Singh has done here is to present a hugely complex subject in a hugely entertaining way. The search for the answer to Fermat's riddle reads like a detective story and not a matehematical treatise and it includes a truly absorbing potted history of the development of maths over the years and, from Pythagoras to Fermat to Godel to Wiles, each part has a fascinating human side to it. Budding mathematicians needn't feel left out as the mechanics of the maths is also included, but it's treated in a gentle way: each step of the problem (and it's solution) is described in a simplified (but certainly not dumbed down) manner and some simple exercises are included in several short appendices. However, take heart! There are several places where elements of the maths are obviously too complex for us mortals and Singh is not afraid to say soo and then gloss over them completely. That may be a disappointment to some, but it's not at all unreasonable in my opinion. All in all, the net result is a book that is sensitive to its readers, intelligent, interesting and important. It's literally unputdownable and it had the added bonus of tricking me into thinking that I'm a little cleverer than I really am. I notice there's an inevitable Wills and Kate bio on the bestseller list at the moment. Put your hard earned cash into Andrew Morton's pockets or read something that will make you feel like a genius. The choice is yours."

It combines some high quality storytelling worthy of a good thriller with important scenes in the history of mathematics as well as simple explanations of certain mathematical ideas. It tells the story of one of the (apparently) simplest theorems ever but having one of the hardest possible proofs in mathematics, and how it eventually gets to be proven (around 350 years later!), with admirable simplicity. But most importantly, it shows people the beauty of mathematics. 5/5."
103,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A fantastically entertaining and educational book about the quest to solve the oldest math problem: Fermat's Last Theorem. The intrigue, mystery, and drama surrounding the famous theorem without a proof (but that Fermat had said he had a proof for, just not enough space to write it in the margins) is exciting enough. All the math greats who have attempted to solve it but come up a little short, or a lot short.But it's much more than that, since the final proof of Fermat's Theorem involves so many other math concepts. This book starts and ends with Fermat, but in the middle it is more like a grand tour of all the mathematical developments that make the proof even possible. It's interesting to read about all the different dead ends and other productive findings (that had tangentially made it a little more possible to solve Fermat, but whose main contribution was in some other area). Also, reading about Galois's amazing life always makes me giddy. I mean, I've read about him before, but his story is just so crazy--math genius turned revolutionary thrown in jail involved in affair ends in duel, scribbles out his last thoughts the night before he dies... amazing.But don't expect to understand how the proof actually works by the end. The proof itself is over 100 pages, so there is no way a normal non-math genius can understand it. But you will get a general idea of the approach/trajectory/style of the final beast. Also, some of the math concepts leading up to it are quite easily comprehensible. I wouldn't recommend this book to a math whiz... it's more of a fun read for the layperson.It would ultimately be more satisfying if the proof were a short elegant thing that didn't involve latest groundbreaking discoveries in math. But maybe the bright side is that we can still wonder about Fermat's original (alleged) proof that was never written down. It had to be different from Andrew Wile's proof; does it exist? Or was Fermat bluffing? Or did he make an error in his proof?"
104,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962158-rakesh-m,5,"This book is a biography of the epic quest to solve the eluding Fermat's last theorem. It chronicles the life and works of not just Fermat, but most of the mathematicians having even a tiny bit to do with the conjecture/theorem. Curious and strange revelations into the lives of many of the princes and princesses of mathematics are presented. It presents the case of lives, pursuits and the times that they lived in. The problems that they face (mathematical and others), how these affect the progress/decline of the field. Simon Singh writes brilliantly mixing accounts of math behind the problem along with the lives of these mathematicians. We get to see accounts of love, suicides, suicide averted by fixating on a proof, duels and revolutionaries. For me it was shocking to know, that it was not just the kings and religious fellows destroying these geniuses and their sanctuaries, but Pythagoras also committed a grave mistake once, sentencing Hippasus to death for arguing that sqrt(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction!A must read for those interested in history behind the problem."

Starting off with ancient Greeks and arriving at the proof using modern mathematics, he explains the struggles of generations of mathematicians. The author never tries to overwhelm us with the mathematics, but tells us about the people who were involved in proving the theorem. Having said that, all the mathematics in the book can be understood with a background in high school mathematics. This book is a great read simply because of the intellectual achievement that it talks about. Strongly recommended if you're remotely interested in mathematics."
107,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"I have a special love for words. I think I always have. They’re fascinating. The words in this book were used for telling a story about numbers, which made me realize I also love numbers so much, I just didn’t know. Math had always been the “easy subject” at school for me, the one which did not require long hours of study, because it was so logical, the one you could check before turning in an exam and know you had the right answers precisely because it matched so perfectly. “Proof is what lies at the heart of maths.”, indeed, so simple, so beautiful. Well, this story is, as the title describes, a true quest to solve one of the most difficult problems in Mathematics which Fermat’s Last Theorem used to be. Simon Singh did this superbly. He is absolutely great at explaining from whole numbers and 1+1 to elliptical equations and modular forms. But the best was to learn about some of the greatest minds that worked so hard in the last century solving problems and doing the maths that have been the basis and tool for proving this theorem and thus, their great contribution to science: Pythagoras and his controversial Pythagorean Brotherhood, Mersenne, Euclid, Diophantus and his most remarkable “Arithmetica”, of course Pierre de Fermat, Pascal, brilliant Euler, Cantor, Sophie Germain, Theano, Hypatia, Maria Agnesi, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Cauchy, Lamè, Kummer, Wolfskehl, Gödel, Turing, Shimura, Taniyama, and Andrew Wiles. These are not the only ones, of course, but the most outstanding for me from this book. I want to make a special mention to the part where Singh talks about the work of women that were mathematicians. Even as of today, there aren’t many of us women dedicated to numbers or number theory, but we have come to a time when we can actually pursue this career, despite the struggles and obstacles that still exist in our societies. But being a mathematician a few centuries ago was completely outrageous and out of this world! Sophie Germain had to study secretly at night and keep a secret stock of candles to do so, because her dad used to confiscate them to prevent her from studying. Or Agnesi who was referred to as the “witch of Agnesi”. And the most extreme of these was Hypatia of Alexandria who suffered the most tragic and brutal death to the hands of the exulted mob led by the patriarch of Alexandria because she was considered a heretic. These stories really moved me and I’m very glad that their names are remembered and admired although they did not have a voice in their own time. Their only voice was their endless curiosity and passion for trying to understand the Universe and their brilliant work pervaded through history and remained printed in our books and forever in our memories, a greatly deserved honor to inspire all of us. And back to Fermat’s Theorem, Wiles amazing work on his childhood’s dream inspired this book and will hopefully inspire many more that see the beauty of numbers to keep working and pushing the frontiers on this science field which Singh perfectly describes as the “language of nature”."

My only gripe with this book is that the author tries to push a narrative a little too hard and tends to over-dramatize certain details. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable mathematical journey. Simon Singh has done well to make the book accessible and not overtly mathematical and confusing to read."

The story starts with Andrew Wiles who brought an end to this endless wait. But the span of the story is far far larger. Love stories, tragedies, moments of brilliances, moments of inspiration, moments of chance all intertwined in a marvellous way to solve this enigma. Did Fermat really have a foolproof proof? If he had it with the tools available at his time, then it still remains an enigma. Simon Singh brings to us this wonderful story in a brilliant way. "

I don't do mathematics and haven't studied anything beyond the bare minimum required for a Bachelor's degree, but I find something wonderful about the pursuits of people like Andrew Wiles and the number theorists who spend years of their lives working on a set of problems. Wiles's obsessive mindset and solitary quest reminded of Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season"" and I wonder if Carlson read this or another account of Wiles's eight-year project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem? (From ""Towel Season"":)When they were dating, he'd begun to try to explain his work to her in metaphors, and she'd continued the game through his career, asking him for comparisons that she'd then inhabit, embellish. Right after they were married and Edison was in graduate school, he'd work late into the night in their apartment and crawl into bed with the calculations still percolating in his head. ""What's it like?"" Leslie would ask. ""Where are you now?"" She could tell he was remote, lit. They talked in territories.""I've crossed all the open ground, and the wind has stopped now. My hope is to find a way through this next place.""""Mountains?""""Right. Okay, mountains--blank, very few markings."" He spoke carefully and with a quiet zeal. ""They're steep, hard to see.""""Is it cold?""""No, but it is strange. It's quiet."" Then he'd turn to her in bed, his eyes bright, alive. ""I'm way past the path. I don't think anyone has climbed this route before. There are no trails, handholds.""Leslie would smile and kiss him in that close proximity. ""Keep going,"" she'd say. ""Halfway up that mountain, there's a woman with a cappuccino cart and a chicken-salad sandwich--me.""Then a smile would break across his face, too, and he would see her, kiss her back, and say it: ""Right. You.""A book has yet to fulfill my odd wish to peek over the shoulder of a mathematician working on a problem like Fermat's Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. Until a science writer like Singh explained it in metaphors and broad concepts I wouldn't understand what the mathematician was doing, but wouldn't it be weirdly magical to observe!"

The narration flows like acetone. The book starts with the climax moment of a 358 year old struggle “Fermat's last theorem”. Singh's writing style paints the whole view (awestruck people, ecstatic protagonist, exuberant surroundings) in front of your eyes. Singh is successful in seizing reader's undivided attention when he recounts the moment when the seed of this curiosity was sown in 10yr. old Wile's mind. And then, starts the roller coaster ride of the great minds who faced the thunderstorms and sunshine in Mathematical history. This book is no less than a time travel machine, which takes us to the ancient Egypt where this beguiling discipline spent its babyhood . Then the journey proceeds era by era, riddle by riddle from 3000 BC to the auspicious day when Wiles finally bid adieu to his childhood dream. Before I could even realize, I was already there with the great mathematicians, feeling the euphoria of slaughtering a puzzle, the frustration of long struggles, standing against the whole world for the love of Mathematics. Reading experience is elevated 1000 folds by the introduction of small mathematical teasers in between the chapters, when a highly motivated mathematician hidden in you will jump to iron it out. Singh takes us through the history of Mathematics related to FLT chronologically depicting many interesting stories. By the time you reach the ending, you are so engrossed in this world that you can experience the pain in the predicaments faced by Andrew Wiles. You will be able to empathize with the setbacks, hopes and tussles Wiles faced when his childhood dream was about to shatter after making it almost there!Best part of the book is “The return of Wiles”, the scenes from “The Dark Knight Rises” running alongside in my mind. One real life example of the victory of the “Never say die” doctrine. Truly mentioned in Daily Mail - “story of an obsessive love affair”!A must read for every enigma lover!"

Unfortunately, so was this book and my quest continues. Nonetheless, this book is very interesting and well written, and shows you how many things that appear to be simple and almost intuitive can be incredibly complex (that's what's so beautiful about math). In situations like this, people always tend to give all the praise to people like Andrew Wiles, without realizing on how much work and discoveries made by other people his work relies on. And even though Wiles deserves all the fame and recognition he can get for his persistence and determination, it's nice to see all the other great mathematicians who greatly contributed being mentioned. Like old saying goes: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes, and if anything, by showing how complex the proof is, it leaves you wondering, did the Fermat really have the solution?If you are only slightly interested in mathematics and were just curious about this certain topic and ideas on which the proof was based on, or are looking for a good place to start, I would definitively recommend this book. But to be fair, you can get all of that by watching previously mentioned documentary and it would cost you much less time. On the other hand, if you want something more complex and mathematical, you won't get it here."

It conveys perfectly to a layman the sense of accomplishment that the mathematical community associates with cracking the proof for this theorem. In that sense, it has the effect of a self-help book even without trying to be one."
117,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299698-pawan,5,"http://iandbooks.wordpress.comIn a way this book “Fermat’s Last Theorem” is a fantasy come true. To be able to read about complex Mathematics in a story book style is something that was possible only in this book by Simon Singh. Before I picked up this book I had no idea about Fermat’s last theorem or its significance. I just read the summary on the back page and felt like picking up the book and once I started reading it, there was no stopping it, though I did skipped over complex mathematical equations part.Fermat’s last theorem states that no set of positive three integers exist such thatan + bn = cnis satisfied for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and he claimed in his writing that he had a proof of this theorem but he did not have space left on the paper on which he was writing at that time. After his death hundreds of Mathematicians across the world tried unsuccessfully for many centuries to get the generic proof but the final proof was found only in 1995. Even though the proof has been found it is based on very complex mathematical models that were not in existence during Fermat’s time. So, it is still a mystery, how Fermat had that proof that was very simple.The book traces this history of Fermat’s last theorem. It is a fascinating story of how the best minds could not figure out something that was done by Fermat such a long time ago. The significance of this theorem is not that it brings some new understanding to the world of Mathematics but lies in the simplicity of the theorem and exceedingly complex proof of it."
118,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance,5,"Absolutely fantastic.The descriptions of all the maths and discoveries in this book are nothing short of joyful, and I felt so excited to be reading all of it. The book explains and shows why math is so amazing, how it is a divine language that describes something (i.e., number properties and their relationships) that exists outside of the physical world, how mathematicians are then often more in search of a truth in the real sense of the word than in search of a practical application or an explanation, how math discoveries can be magical and fulfilling and immortal in that they are untouched by human perception. My heart literally started beating faster when I saw the published first page of the proof. The book does a great job of conveying a narrative arc and giving background when necessary, and in presenting a pretty complicated topic in an accessible but not-dumbed down way. (Although in the U.S. the title of the book was changed to “Fermat’s Enigma,"" sigh.)Also, quite charmingly, one of the major turning points in the book is a conversation at Cafe Strada in which someone exclaims, “But don’t you see? You’ve done it! All you have to do is add some gamma-zero of (M) structure and just run through your argument and it works. It gives you everything you need.”I learned that mathematicians are big weirdos, and that they like to chat each other up at tea every day. I also learned that 10^10^10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics.”Thanks for the rec Sue!"
119,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"The book is a quick read. There is just enough information in it for a layman to know sufficiently about the Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof to be able to boast at a coffee table discussion with friends. And that's all.While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the poof of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view that is sometimes a bit arguable and of course oversimplified. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably. Trying to condense the basic ideas of the comprehensive proof that only few top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. Still I feel that the essence should have been in the math, but the reader gets instead a inspiring story, about a man's zealous quest for an absolute truth."
120,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Simon Singh has the ability to present a story about a mathematics problem, and tell it like a detective story. He makes the subject exciting, even though the outcome is well known. Singh intersperses history with discussions about the mathematics, and makes it quite understandable. Singh starts with the roots of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, by recounting the stories and mathematics of Pythagoras, Euclid, and Euler. Other, less well-known mathematicians are also given credit, for example Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin Cauchy, and Evariste Galois. Three hundred fifty years ago, Fermat wrote the following theorem in the margin of a mathematics book:  And, Fermat wrote that he had a marvelous proof, but no room in the margin for it. For centuries, mathematicians have attempted to prove the theorem, without success. It had been sort of a ""holy grail"" of mathematicians to prove the theorem, and many brilliant minds spent years on it. Perhaps in was unprovable, and worst of all, Kurt Godel showed that some theorems are actually undecidable--that is to say, it is impossible even to decide whether or not a theorem is true.Singh recounts a fascinating story of the gifted mathematician, Paul Wolfskehl. He was very depressed, and decided to commit suicide on a particular night, at midnight. While waiting for that time to arrive, he started to read about the failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He became so engrossed in the subject, that he worked well past midnight. He found a gap in the logic of a predecessor, and was so proud of himself that he gained a new desire for life. And, in his will he established a fund of 100,000 marks to be given to the mathematician who first completes the proof of the theorem!Much of the book describes how Andrew Wiles developed a growing interest in the theorem. He worked in almost total isolation for seven years, in order not to be distracted. He occasionally published little tidbits unrelated to his real endeavor, in order to dispel suspicions about what his real work entailed.The central piece of the proof entailed proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, that linked modular forms with elliptic equations. This was a linkage between two far-flung branches of mathematics that seemed to be totally unrelated. To prove the conjecture would allow incredible advances to be made. And then, Ken Ribet showed that a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would, in effect, be a direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But many people tried and failed to develop the proof. But that is exactly what Andrew Wiles worked on for so many years.I had previously read that during Andrew Wiles' famous lecture, he just casually let the unsuspecting audience know, ""and that is a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."" Well, this book tells a somewhat different story. Most of the audience had heard rumors that the third of Wiles' lectures would be of historical significance. They came prepared with cameras, and took photographs during the lecture. So, it was a surprise, but not a total surprise.After Wiles' manuscript of the proof was sent to a publisher, six mathematicians reviewed it, and a crucial gap was found in it. Wiles worked furiously for a nightmarish year, and with the help of Richard Taylor, finally closed the gap. Today, Wiles is recognized as the one who developed the proof. But it is clear, that Wiles ""stood on the shoulders of giants""; he used--and developed--mathematical techniques that had not existed just a few decades previously.Simon Singh writes with a wonderful style. It is clear, not too jargon-heavy but contains enough mathematical ""meat"" to seem satisfying. The book is followed by ten appendixes that contain more details about some of the mathematics; they are not overly technical, and give the reader a better understanding of some of the issues. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in math. "
121,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"Before delving into the book itself, I thought I’d start things off by introducing the problem it’s concerned with, just in case you aren’t already familiar with it.So, what exactly is Fermat’s Last Theorem? Well, basically, this is it: As you can see, the conjecture is quite easy to understand, and yet, believe it or not, it was so remarkably difficult to prove that it took over 350 years to accomplish! The fact that Fermat (teasingly?) scribbled this rather infuriating note in the margin only added to the frustration felt by the scores of mathematicians who did battle with it over the centuries: “I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.”No doubt the cheeky bastard would’ve enjoyed Twitter:Okay, now that that’s been taken care of, it’s time to look at the actual book.What Kind of Book is Fermat’s Enigma?Simply put, Fermat’s Enigma is a history book. It is most definitely NOT a math book, so don’t expect to find any degree of mathematical rigor or complexity here. There are a handful of fairly simple proofs included in the appendices, but overall, the concepts under discussion are glossed over in a superficial manner, never examined in any kind of detail. If you want something that fleshes out how the proof actually works, I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere. (Singh was kind enough to include quite a few “further reading suggestions” at the end of this book. While I’ve not looked into any of the titles he recommended, I assume many of those might prove more to your liking if you prefer a “math book” on the subject.)In any case, while Singh did not pursue the actual mathematics in any real sense, he did positively excel at telling the story of an utterly fascinating struggle, one which spanned hundreds of years and ensnared countless brilliant, talented minds. Readers make the acquaintance of such notable mathematicians as Pythagoras (whose work paved the way for Fermat), Leonhard Euler, Paul Wolfskehl, Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Evariste Galois, Yutaka Taniyama, Goro Shimura, and of course Andrew Wiles, the man, the myth, the legend who finally proved the damn thing. Overall, I was surprised and delighted by just how compelling the story actually was. For me, this book quickly became a veritable page-turner, one I was loathe to put aside. Some may argue that in order to accomplish this, he omitted too much relevant information, that he sacrificed depth for readability. Perhaps this is true to an extent, but in my opinion, while it was admittedly easy to read and follow, it still managed to include a fair amount of pertinent, interesting material. More importantly, it never got bogged down with unnecessary details or lost in minutiae, and never meandered down exasperating tangents, as many otherwise outstanding history books are wont to do. And ultimately, what made this book so very stimulating was that the manner in which the story was told really made it come alive. Singh bestowed a truly suspenseful, exciting quest upon the reader, one full of twists and turns, and even *gasp* its fair share of drama. He enthusiastically demonstrated just how action-packed and exhilarating the life of the mind can be. And for accomplishing this tremendous feat, I heartily recommend the book, warts and all.And Now, For a Few Words on the Star of the ShowAndrew Wiles is an extraordinary human being. Fascinated by Fermat’s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, he vowed to conquer that most impossible of proofs. This was at the age of ten, mind you. I seriously can’t get past that. And then, true to his word, the little rascal grew up to become an eminent mathematician, one who finally went into seclusion for seven years in order to hack away at this tremendous proof. While a not insignificant error marred the first release of said proof, he didn’t let that deter him, but persevered and managed to rectify the error, and, within a couple of years, came out with THE proof. Holy goddamn shit. To me, Wiles’ story was completely and utterly inspiring. I was frankly amazed by what the human mind can achieve; I think I will always be in awe of Wiles’ fierce determination and incredible tenacity. Mad respect. Anyway, as you can probably tell, Andrew Wiles is a personal hero of mine. He is an undeniable, ultimate badass. Wayne and Garth said it best:"

A very trite remark, too lengthy to write in the margin so it is elsewhere, and no one has ever found it or managed to prove his statement, until - - - this book is a brilliant read, you would think it would be as dry as dust, but no! It is a superb account of the proof of the last theorem from Fermat's notebook to be proven. The only thing that still niggles at me, although the mathematical proof is fabulous, it uses modern techniques not available to Fermat, so it is proven but how the hell did Fermat do it??????A brilliant book, beautifully written a tremendous historical question answered in a very modern way, fabulous, well done for readability."

125,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This is the kind of book that we non mathematical minds can easily digest and love. It gives you an epic scope of the number of minds that it takes to build new ideas. I doubt if Fermat had actually solved this theorem correctly, but this is impossible to prove. Fermat's theorem however was not impossible to prove! It was solved! Thanks to the efforts of many men (and women!) over many lifetimes and one final man who had the determination and persistence to finish the unthinkable. This book has a lot of wonderful elements, and really exemplifies a love of mathematics. Although if you want to actually understand the theorem this book may not be for you! I can honestly say reading it did not put the theorem in any more digestible light than it started out with. Perhaps it was to the authors advantage to skip the technicalities and focus on the enjoyment of the journey. I personally loved this approach, but it may not be for everyone, especially if you are actually looking to understand the theorem (a massive undertaking that is really not in my repertoire to comment on). "
126,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"What a fun book this was (thanks, Trevor, for the recommendation)! There are many reasons I think I like (good) nonfiction -- a sense of direct relevance, gravitas, frequent insights into the workings of the universe (and people), but mostly for knowledge narcs -- high levels of information density served up into an intriguing package by someone else who has undertaken the heavy lifting (research, organization, thinking). So, here in Singh's work I get a solid lay understanding not only of the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem, but of much of mathematics (and the lives of mathematicians) since the seventeenth century.I've been thinking also about what attracts me to books on mathematical topics -- the works by Martin Gardner, William Poundstone, and the various other authors in the company of whose thoughts I've had pleasure to spend a week or more. What I've come away with, is that the best of them feed off surprises, those bits of counterintuitive anecdotes that leave you blurting out, ""Huh. How about that,"" and then looking madly around for someone to tell. Like a book of jokes, riddles, or puzzles that provides immediate gratification in the back of the book, Fermat's Enigma plugs at least ten conundrums (and their easy-to-understand, logical solutions) into its appendices. For example -- say you're unlucky enough to be forced into a three-way duel. If everyone gets to take turns in order of their skill such that worst shoots first, what should the worst do? Aim at the best in the hopes of getting lucky and eliminating the most dangerous gunsel? Nope, the correct answer is to pass up the turn in the hopes that your first shot will get to be expended against only one remaining combatant. That way, even if you miss, you at least had a chance to take aim at the only person able to shoot back.Pierre Fermat turns out to have been quite the prankster, often tweaking professional mathematicians and academics by mailing them problems they knew full well he had already solved. For those who don't keep this type of trivia at the forefront of their brains, Fermat's the French recluse (and hanging circuit jurist) who once famously scribbled in a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica that x^n + y^n ≠ z^n for any number n greater than 2, a propostion for which he had ""a truly marvelous demonstration… which this margin is too narrow to contain."" This gets to be Fermat's Last Theorem, simply because it ends up being the last of his conundrums to be proven (not necessarily the last one he wrote). Just think, were it not for the scrupulous care taken by Fermat's son to go through and publish all of Fermat, Sr.'s writings, the world would not have been tantalized by this particular gem for 
over 350 YEARS
.Andrew Wiles published the first (and only?) proof in 1994, and Enigma does a tremendous job of walking the reader through not only the stunning depth of his intellectual achievement, but its significance as well. Suffice it to say that I was happy here to read that Taniyama-Shimura get their well-earned due and that modular and elliptical equations can finally be understood to be mathematically analogous (whether or not I have any idea what modular equations actually are). Still, all of this leads to what I think is an even more tantalizing problem. We now know that all of Fermat's conjectures ultimately proved to be solvable and that Fermat's own notes would seem to indicate that he had indeed apparently found ways to solve each of them. But there is no doubt that Fermat's solution could not have relied on the up-to-the-minute maths Wiles employs over 200 pages. So if it was really the limitations of the margin and not of Fermat that inhibited publication… what was Fermat's proof?"
127,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Strap in, guys. I’m going to walk you through the history of how Fermat’s Last Theorum was proved, all in one little (okay, big) review. And I can do this because of this awesome, semi-accessible, frequently tangent-taking, but mostly, this deeply fascinating book.----------STEP ONE: THE THEORUM----------For the unenlightened, Fermat’s Last Theorum is this: you probably know the Pythagorean theorum, a² + b² = c², which explains that if you square the shorter two sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, you get the value of third side squared. This is easily proved (that is, demonstrated to be completely, utterly, logically true via a mathematical proof, using axioms known to be true, which is just like a logic proof if you’ve done philosophy. Or a geometry proof, if you went to 9th grade). Take any triangle, and this will be true. There are infinite solutions to this equation—literally infinite values of A, B, and C which will render this solution true. However, Fermat discovered that the formula an + bn = cn where n > 2 has NO whole number solutions. (Go ahead, give it a whirl. I’ll wait).Then he challenged the mathematical community to create a mathematical proof demonstrating this must be true. While tantalizing them with the knowledge he’d already created a proof for this with a scribbled note in the margin of his notebook: “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Asshole. So sparked centuries of people trying to write this proof, to no avail. Until Professor Andrew Wiles (who has the most apropos name ever—he has wiles indeed) of Cambridge, in 1993.***For clarity, this is Fermat’s Equation (which I’ll refer to as FE): an + bn = cn where n > 2And THIS is Fermat’s Last Theorum (which I’ll refer to as FLT): “There are no solutions to Fermat’s Equation”***----------TANGENT: GODEL----------At this point, it’s been assumed that math is logically perfect—that if you correctly build a proof using axioms (like m + n = n + m), it must be true (and if it’s proven to be true, nothing can prove it to be false). This is known as “axiomatic set theory.” Along came Godel (who is analyzed to death by my beloved, Doug Hofstadter- see here and here). His ideas are as follows: 1. If axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there have to be theorems that can’t be proved or disproved. Why? Because of paradoxes. Godel translated the following statement into mathematical notation: “This statement has no proof.” If that’s false, then you COULD create a proof for that statement—however, that would make the statement false, so how could you have a proof for that? So it has to be true. But if it’s true, it can’t be proved because that’s what it literally says. It’s a mathematical statement that is true, but could never be proved to be true (an “undecidable statement”). 2. There’s no way to prove that axiomatic set theory is consistent; in a way, it’s one of those “undecidable statement” that’s true but can’t be proved to be true. Interestingly, this parallels the physicist Heisenberg’s discovery of the uncertainty principle, but we won’t get into that. Now, there aren’t very many of those undecidable statements. Godel couldn’t really point to any other undecidable statements besides the one above, so people assumed they were found only in the most extreme math and would probably never even be encountered. Welp. A young student named Paul Cohen at Stanford discovered a way to test whether a question is undecidable, and in doing so, discovered several more.Which sparked some fear in mathematicians. What if Fermat’s Last Theorum was undecidable?! What if they were wasting their time trying to prove the unprovable?Interestingly, if it were an undecidable statement, it couldn’t be proved—yet it would have to be true. The theorum says “there are no whole numbers to the equation an + bn = cn where n > 2.” If this were false, then it would be possible to prove this by offering a solution to this—by finding a whole number N that’s greater than 2 that allows the equation to be solved. Which would make it a decidable statement, which is a contradiction. So it can’t be false and also be an undecidable statement. In other words, Fermat’s Last Theorum might be totally true but there might be no way to prove it. ----------STEP TWO: TANIYAMA-SHIMURA CONJECTURE----------Modular forms are a mathematical tool, sort of like impossible forms or shapes, that reveal a lot about how numbers are related. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (TSC), created by two Japanese mathematicians (one of whom tragically and abruptly killed himself quite young) says every modular form is related to a specific elliptic equation (elliptic equations were Andrew Wiles’s main area of study; they’re a type of equation, not super important that you understand them). The fact that these were unified meant there’s a kind of Rosetta stone that’s been discovered: “Simple intuitions in the modular world translate into deep truths in the elliptic world, and vice versa. Very profound problems in the elliptic world can get solved sometimes by translating them using this Rosetta stone into the modular world, and discovering that we have the insights and tools in the modular world to treat the translated problem. Back in the elliptic world we would have been at a loss.”Beyond that awesomeness, the TSC suggests something even more interesting: that possibly all of mathematics, all the different worlds of mathematics, might have parallels in other worlds, as with the elliptic world and the modular world. All of mathematics might be unified—arguably the absolute ultimate goal of abstract mathematics, because this would give us the most complete picture, and the biggest arsenal of tools to solve mathematical problems. ----------STEP THREE: RIBET’S THEORUM----------This is all important for FLT because of something called Ribet’s Theorum (Ribet was a colleague of Wiles). Ribet’s Theorum goes like this: the imagined solution to FE can be translated into an elliptic equation. And that elliptic equation doesn’t seem to have a modular world equivalent. But the TSC claims that every elliptic equation must be related to a modular form. So if you can PROVE that the elliptic form of the solution to FE has no modular form (which we can! The proof was done in 1986), the following is true: if the TSC is true (i.e. all elliptic equations have modular forms), and the elliptic form of the imagined solution to FE has no modular form, then the imagined solution cannot exist, proving FLT. So now, all we have to do is prove that the TSC is true, and FLT is automatically proven to be true. And this—THIS—is what Andrew Wiles focused on. Proving the TSC (Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture).----------STEP FOUR: PROVING THE THEORUM----------Wiles finally succeeded when he applied a new method called the Kolyvagin-Flach method, which groups elliptic equations into families and then proves that an elliptic equation in that family has a modular form; if that elliptic equation has a modular form, then all other elliptic equations in that family also has a modular form. However, the Kolyvagin-Flach method has to be adapted for each family of elliptic equations. Wiles successfully adapted the method for all families of elliptic equations, thereby proving that all elliptic equations have modular forms (which, as a reminder, is basis of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and proving the TSC proves FLT). Two months before I was born, in 1993, he proved FLT in a series of 3 lectures. Kinda. Actually, there was a minor flaw in his proof (essentially, he might have failed to properly adapt the Kolyvagin-Flach method for some of the families of equations) but it doesn’t really matter because a year later, Wiles published a work-around to that flaw, so he proved FLT once and for all. ----------CONCLUSION----------All I can think about is: maybe if math looked like this, if THIS had been our material in high school—maybe then I wouldn’t have disliked it. Maybe other people wouldn’t, either. What a shoddy job we do teaching our children the wonder of learning."

Sounds dull. Except that the mathematician jots down that he has found this proof, but not what the proof is. And for hundredsd of years the greatest minds in mathematics have tried to find this simple proof and been beaten by the problem time and again.This really is a delightful book and one that gives an insight into how mathematicians think about the world. The proof of Pythagoras's theorem given in this book is so simple that the beauty of mathematical proof is made plain to everyone.

130,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,3,"I never watched any documentaries before going to college (and this was about a century and a half ago.. I am getting old -_-. But yeah, 2009 to be precise). I was always interested in NatGeo and History Channel - but they never showed the real deal on television. The documentaries would be mostly half assed, and at worst, total crap. That's also how Indian television landscape can be broadly categorized too, give or take a few exceptions ofcourse. And so I grew up loving the sciences based on what was taught in school curriculum, and elsewhere what I read on the slow 64-bit internet connection.And then college happened. Parents got me my own laptop - and the college intranet had a ton of stuff that other students shared. That place and that time - was where my love for documentaries was born. I had never been so fascinated with anything before. And the first two that I watched - in a long line of them - were Einstein's Biggest Blunder and BBC's Fermat's Last Theorem. The memory of that sunday afternoon is still pretty fresh. Back then, I only had a casual interest in astronomy and cosmology, and Einstein's theories were still something exotic. And so I basically understood jackshit from the first documentary. Even more intrigued than before, I started the second one. Fermat's Last Theorem was much more relatable - I had known the theorem, and understood the concept too. Years later when I joined goodreads, I found out that there was a book too. Keeping in with the tradition of firsts, it became the first book on my TBR pile too. Where it stayed until a few days ago - and I finally marked it as read last night. To be honest, this isn't the greatest book ever. It isnt even Simon Singh's best, who delivered the goods the much better in Big Bang. But it surely captures the essence of all mathematical and scientific endeavor very well - That every once in a while, in the middle of an ordinary life, science gives us a fairytale"
131,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,5,"If you buy the latest Jilly Cooper instead of this you WILL go to hell!This one languished on my bookshelf for the best part of a year as I was too scared to pick it up & start it. What held me back is what will probably put a lot of other potential readers off trying it - the boring old ""I'm no good at maths"" argument. Although my maths education is probably little above average (a good O Level and a terrible A Level, after which I rallied somewhat to obtain a reasonable HNC maths module) it's //very// many years out of use and it's all I can do to add two numbers up in my head. Given that this book is about a problem that flummoxed the best mathematical minds in the world for over 350 years you'd be forgiven for putting this back on the shelf and choosing something a little simpler. Well, don't even try that... YOU DON'T NEED ANY MATHS TO READ THIS! What Singh has done here is to present a hugely complex subject in a hugely entertaining way. The search for the answer to Fermat's riddle reads like a detective story and not a matehematical treatise and it includes a truly absorbing potted history of the development of maths over the years and, from Pythagoras to Fermat to Godel to Wiles, each part has a fascinating human side to it. Budding mathematicians needn't feel left out as the mechanics of the maths is also included, but it's treated in a gentle way: each step of the problem (and it's solution) is described in a simplified (but certainly not dumbed down) manner and some simple exercises are included in several short appendices. However, take heart! There are several places where elements of the maths are obviously too complex for us mortals and Singh is not afraid to say soo and then gloss over them completely. That may be a disappointment to some, but it's not at all unreasonable in my opinion. All in all, the net result is a book that is sensitive to its readers, intelligent, interesting and important. It's literally unputdownable and it had the added bonus of tricking me into thinking that I'm a little cleverer than I really am. I notice there's an inevitable Wills and Kate bio on the bestseller list at the moment. Put your hard earned cash into Andrew Morton's pockets or read something that will make you feel like a genius. The choice is yours."
132,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46468957-paul,5,"This is by far the best popular science book I've read. It combines some high quality storytelling worthy of a good thriller with important scenes in the history of mathematics as well as simple explanations of certain mathematical ideas. It tells the story of one of the (apparently) simplest theorems ever but having one of the hardest possible proofs in mathematics, and how it eventually gets to be proven (around 350 years later!), with admirable simplicity. But most importantly, it shows people the beauty of mathematics. 5/5."
133,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A fantastically entertaining and educational book about the quest to solve the oldest math problem: Fermat's Last Theorem. The intrigue, mystery, and drama surrounding the famous theorem without a proof (but that Fermat had said he had a proof for, just not enough space to write it in the margins) is exciting enough. All the math greats who have attempted to solve it but come up a little short, or a lot short.But it's much more than that, since the final proof of Fermat's Theorem involves so many other math concepts. This book starts and ends with Fermat, but in the middle it is more like a grand tour of all the mathematical developments that make the proof even possible. It's interesting to read about all the different dead ends and other productive findings (that had tangentially made it a little more possible to solve Fermat, but whose main contribution was in some other area). Also, reading about Galois's amazing life always makes me giddy. I mean, I've read about him before, but his story is just so crazy--math genius turned revolutionary thrown in jail involved in affair ends in duel, scribbles out his last thoughts the night before he dies... amazing.But don't expect to understand how the proof actually works by the end. The proof itself is over 100 pages, so there is no way a normal non-math genius can understand it. But you will get a general idea of the approach/trajectory/style of the final beast. Also, some of the math concepts leading up to it are quite easily comprehensible. I wouldn't recommend this book to a math whiz... it's more of a fun read for the layperson.It would ultimately be more satisfying if the proof were a short elegant thing that didn't involve latest groundbreaking discoveries in math. But maybe the bright side is that we can still wonder about Fermat's original (alleged) proof that was never written down. It had to be different from Andrew Wile's proof; does it exist? Or was Fermat bluffing? Or did he make an error in his proof?"
134,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962158-rakesh-m,5,"This book is a biography of the epic quest to solve the eluding Fermat's last theorem. It chronicles the life and works of not just Fermat, but most of the mathematicians having even a tiny bit to do with the conjecture/theorem. Curious and strange revelations into the lives of many of the princes and princesses of mathematics are presented. It presents the case of lives, pursuits and the times that they lived in. The problems that they face (mathematical and others), how these affect the progress/decline of the field. Simon Singh writes brilliantly mixing accounts of math behind the problem along with the lives of these mathematicians. We get to see accounts of love, suicides, suicide averted by fixating on a proof, duels and revolutionaries. For me it was shocking to know, that it was not just the kings and religious fellows destroying these geniuses and their sanctuaries, but Pythagoras also committed a grave mistake once, sentencing Hippasus to death for arguing that sqrt(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction!A must read for those interested in history behind the problem."

136,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8700554-hariprasad,4,"Simon Singh gives an excellent account of the quest for the solution to Fermat's puzzle. Starting off with ancient Greeks and arriving at the proof using modern mathematics, he explains the struggles of generations of mathematicians. The author never tries to overwhelm us with the mathematics, but tells us about the people who were involved in proving the theorem. Having said that, all the mathematics in the book can be understood with a background in high school mathematics. This book is a great read simply because of the intellectual achievement that it talks about. Strongly recommended if you're remotely interested in mathematics."
137,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"I have a special love for words. I think I always have. They’re fascinating. The words in this book were used for telling a story about numbers, which made me realize I also love numbers so much, I just didn’t know. Math had always been the “easy subject” at school for me, the one which did not require long hours of study, because it was so logical, the one you could check before turning in an exam and know you had the right answers precisely because it matched so perfectly. “Proof is what lies at the heart of maths.”, indeed, so simple, so beautiful. Well, this story is, as the title describes, a true quest to solve one of the most difficult problems in Mathematics which Fermat’s Last Theorem used to be. Simon Singh did this superbly. He is absolutely great at explaining from whole numbers and 1+1 to elliptical equations and modular forms. But the best was to learn about some of the greatest minds that worked so hard in the last century solving problems and doing the maths that have been the basis and tool for proving this theorem and thus, their great contribution to science: Pythagoras and his controversial Pythagorean Brotherhood, Mersenne, Euclid, Diophantus and his most remarkable “Arithmetica”, of course Pierre de Fermat, Pascal, brilliant Euler, Cantor, Sophie Germain, Theano, Hypatia, Maria Agnesi, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Cauchy, Lamè, Kummer, Wolfskehl, Gödel, Turing, Shimura, Taniyama, and Andrew Wiles. These are not the only ones, of course, but the most outstanding for me from this book. I want to make a special mention to the part where Singh talks about the work of women that were mathematicians. Even as of today, there aren’t many of us women dedicated to numbers or number theory, but we have come to a time when we can actually pursue this career, despite the struggles and obstacles that still exist in our societies. But being a mathematician a few centuries ago was completely outrageous and out of this world! Sophie Germain had to study secretly at night and keep a secret stock of candles to do so, because her dad used to confiscate them to prevent her from studying. Or Agnesi who was referred to as the “witch of Agnesi”. And the most extreme of these was Hypatia of Alexandria who suffered the most tragic and brutal death to the hands of the exulted mob led by the patriarch of Alexandria because she was considered a heretic. These stories really moved me and I’m very glad that their names are remembered and admired although they did not have a voice in their own time. Their only voice was their endless curiosity and passion for trying to understand the Universe and their brilliant work pervaded through history and remained printed in our books and forever in our memories, a greatly deserved honor to inspire all of us. And back to Fermat’s Theorem, Wiles amazing work on his childhood’s dream inspired this book and will hopefully inspire many more that see the beauty of numbers to keep working and pushing the frontiers on this science field which Singh perfectly describes as the “language of nature”."
138,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25904341-vignesh-ramanathan,5,"A very nice read detailing the incredible journey behind the solution of this theorem. My only gripe with this book is that the author tries to push a narrative a little too hard and tends to over-dramatize certain details. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable mathematical journey. Simon Singh has done well to make the book accessible and not overtly mathematical and confusing to read."

The story starts with Andrew Wiles who brought an end to this endless wait. But the span of the story is far far larger. Love stories, tragedies, moments of brilliances, moments of inspiration, moments of chance all intertwined in a marvellous way to solve this enigma. Did Fermat really have a foolproof proof? If he had it with the tools available at his time, then it still remains an enigma. Simon Singh brings to us this wonderful story in a brilliant way. "
140,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"Reading this book I caught a glimpse of the rarefied atmosphere of mathematicians and their processes of discovery. I don't do mathematics and haven't studied anything beyond the bare minimum required for a Bachelor's degree, but I find something wonderful about the pursuits of people like Andrew Wiles and the number theorists who spend years of their lives working on a set of problems. Wiles's obsessive mindset and solitary quest reminded of Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season"" and I wonder if Carlson read this or another account of Wiles's eight-year project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem? (From ""Towel Season"":)When they were dating, he'd begun to try to explain his work to her in metaphors, and she'd continued the game through his career, asking him for comparisons that she'd then inhabit, embellish. Right after they were married and Edison was in graduate school, he'd work late into the night in their apartment and crawl into bed with the calculations still percolating in his head. ""What's it like?"" Leslie would ask. ""Where are you now?"" She could tell he was remote, lit. They talked in territories.""I've crossed all the open ground, and the wind has stopped now. My hope is to find a way through this next place.""""Mountains?""""Right. Okay, mountains--blank, very few markings."" He spoke carefully and with a quiet zeal. ""They're steep, hard to see.""""Is it cold?""""No, but it is strange. It's quiet."" Then he'd turn to her in bed, his eyes bright, alive. ""I'm way past the path. I don't think anyone has climbed this route before. There are no trails, handholds.""Leslie would smile and kiss him in that close proximity. ""Keep going,"" she'd say. ""Halfway up that mountain, there's a woman with a cappuccino cart and a chicken-salad sandwich--me.""Then a smile would break across his face, too, and he would see her, kiss her back, and say it: ""Right. You.""A book has yet to fulfill my odd wish to peek over the shoulder of a mathematician working on a problem like Fermat's Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. Until a science writer like Singh explained it in metaphors and broad concepts I wouldn't understand what the mathematician was doing, but wouldn't it be weirdly magical to observe!"

I think that what I liked the most about this book is that I was actually able to understand a good sixty percent of it. With the other forty percent, I proceeded on faith. Come to think of it, those percentages hold true for the rest of my life. There are times when your best bet is to find a good math book. Two plus two is four.

143,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"well, the main thing i took from this book is probably that maths is a field for privileged white men. you have to be rich enough to be able to live comfortably while devoting their life to solving a centuries-old problem simply because they think proving it would be ""satisfying"". you must also be white - or at least living in the west - so that you are actually recognized for your work, otherwise your work will be spotted by someone who lives in the west who will take credit for it. and you must be male. obviously. the politics of the world of mathematics is interesting stuff folks. anyway, it's an alright book. very informative n clear (most of the time). also pretty funny. although i would recommend the 1st half of the book to pretty much anyone, it does sort of get a bit jargon-y and vague by the end. i still enjoyed it, but not at much as i did the first half. i did find the lack of dates for all the events a bit annoying. singh often jumped from event to event, without giving his readers a very good timeline of happenings. aaaanyway. i still learnt a lot from this book. and it's very engaging. if you're interested at all in the history of mathematics, i would definitely recommend. it doesn't really tell you how to solve fermat's last theorem (you'd have to read a 200 page paper to find out sorry), but it gives you a pretty good overview of how mathematicians collectively got there. while also including a couple maths puzzles and a collection of proofs in the back <3 (i love proofs)"
144,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10375644-akanksha,5,"Most interesting non-fiction book I have ever read.Simon Singh's style of weaving a scientific concept into a beautiful story leaves no occasion for the fictional characters and plots. The narration flows like acetone. The book starts with the climax moment of a 358 year old struggle “Fermat's last theorem”. Singh's writing style paints the whole view (awestruck people, ecstatic protagonist, exuberant surroundings) in front of your eyes. Singh is successful in seizing reader's undivided attention when he recounts the moment when the seed of this curiosity was sown in 10yr. old Wile's mind. And then, starts the roller coaster ride of the great minds who faced the thunderstorms and sunshine in Mathematical history. This book is no less than a time travel machine, which takes us to the ancient Egypt where this beguiling discipline spent its babyhood . Then the journey proceeds era by era, riddle by riddle from 3000 BC to the auspicious day when Wiles finally bid adieu to his childhood dream. Before I could even realize, I was already there with the great mathematicians, feeling the euphoria of slaughtering a puzzle, the frustration of long struggles, standing against the whole world for the love of Mathematics. Reading experience is elevated 1000 folds by the introduction of small mathematical teasers in between the chapters, when a highly motivated mathematician hidden in you will jump to iron it out. Singh takes us through the history of Mathematics related to FLT chronologically depicting many interesting stories. By the time you reach the ending, you are so engrossed in this world that you can experience the pain in the predicaments faced by Andrew Wiles. You will be able to empathize with the setbacks, hopes and tussles Wiles faced when his childhood dream was about to shatter after making it almost there!Best part of the book is “The return of Wiles”, the scenes from “The Dark Knight Rises” running alongside in my mind. One real life example of the victory of the “Never say die” doctrine. Truly mentioned in Daily Mail - “story of an obsessive love affair”!A must read for every enigma lover!"

Unfortunately, so was this book and my quest continues. Nonetheless, this book is very interesting and well written, and shows you how many things that appear to be simple and almost intuitive can be incredibly complex (that's what's so beautiful about math). In situations like this, people always tend to give all the praise to people like Andrew Wiles, without realizing on how much work and discoveries made by other people his work relies on. And even though Wiles deserves all the fame and recognition he can get for his persistence and determination, it's nice to see all the other great mathematicians who greatly contributed being mentioned. Like old saying goes: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes, and if anything, by showing how complex the proof is, it leaves you wondering, did the Fermat really have the solution?If you are only slightly interested in mathematics and were just curious about this certain topic and ideas on which the proof was based on, or are looking for a good place to start, I would definitively recommend this book. But to be fair, you can get all of that by watching previously mentioned documentary and it would cost you much less time. On the other hand, if you want something more complex and mathematical, you won't get it here."
146,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35395038-amith,4,"This book finds a way to narrate the chain of events from the time of Pythagoras to the final proof of Fermat's last theorem by Andrew Wiles, entwining with it the key mathematical concepts presented in an accessible form and stories of the mathematicians who made those contributions. It conveys perfectly to a layman the sense of accomplishment that the mathematical community associates with cracking the proof for this theorem. In that sense, it has the effect of a self-help book even without trying to be one."
147,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299698-pawan,5,"http://iandbooks.wordpress.comIn a way this book “Fermat’s Last Theorem” is a fantasy come true. To be able to read about complex Mathematics in a story book style is something that was possible only in this book by Simon Singh. Before I picked up this book I had no idea about Fermat’s last theorem or its significance. I just read the summary on the back page and felt like picking up the book and once I started reading it, there was no stopping it, though I did skipped over complex mathematical equations part.Fermat’s last theorem states that no set of positive three integers exist such thatan + bn = cnis satisfied for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and he claimed in his writing that he had a proof of this theorem but he did not have space left on the paper on which he was writing at that time. After his death hundreds of Mathematicians across the world tried unsuccessfully for many centuries to get the generic proof but the final proof was found only in 1995. Even though the proof has been found it is based on very complex mathematical models that were not in existence during Fermat’s time. So, it is still a mystery, how Fermat had that proof that was very simple.The book traces this history of Fermat’s last theorem. It is a fascinating story of how the best minds could not figure out something that was done by Fermat such a long time ago. The significance of this theorem is not that it brings some new understanding to the world of Mathematics but lies in the simplicity of the theorem and exceedingly complex proof of it."
148,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance,5,"Absolutely fantastic.The descriptions of all the maths and discoveries in this book are nothing short of joyful, and I felt so excited to be reading all of it. The book explains and shows why math is so amazing, how it is a divine language that describes something (i.e., number properties and their relationships) that exists outside of the physical world, how mathematicians are then often more in search of a truth in the real sense of the word than in search of a practical application or an explanation, how math discoveries can be magical and fulfilling and immortal in that they are untouched by human perception. My heart literally started beating faster when I saw the published first page of the proof. The book does a great job of conveying a narrative arc and giving background when necessary, and in presenting a pretty complicated topic in an accessible but not-dumbed down way. (Although in the U.S. the title of the book was changed to “Fermat’s Enigma,"" sigh.)Also, quite charmingly, one of the major turning points in the book is a conversation at Cafe Strada in which someone exclaims, “But don’t you see? You’ve done it! All you have to do is add some gamma-zero of (M) structure and just run through your argument and it works. It gives you everything you need.”I learned that mathematicians are big weirdos, and that they like to chat each other up at tea every day. I also learned that 10^10^10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics.”Thanks for the rec Sue!"
149,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"The book is a quick read. There is just enough information in it for a layman to know sufficiently about the Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof to be able to boast at a coffee table discussion with friends. And that's all.While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the poof of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view that is sometimes a bit arguable and of course oversimplified. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably. Trying to condense the basic ideas of the comprehensive proof that only few top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. Still I feel that the essence should have been in the math, but the reader gets instead a inspiring story, about a man's zealous quest for an absolute truth."
150,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Simon Singh has the ability to present a story about a mathematics problem, and tell it like a detective story. He makes the subject exciting, even though the outcome is well known. Singh intersperses history with discussions about the mathematics, and makes it quite understandable. Singh starts with the roots of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, by recounting the stories and mathematics of Pythagoras, Euclid, and Euler. Other, less well-known mathematicians are also given credit, for example Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin Cauchy, and Evariste Galois. Three hundred fifty years ago, Fermat wrote the following theorem in the margin of a mathematics book:  And, Fermat wrote that he had a marvelous proof, but no room in the margin for it. For centuries, mathematicians have attempted to prove the theorem, without success. It had been sort of a ""holy grail"" of mathematicians to prove the theorem, and many brilliant minds spent years on it. Perhaps in was unprovable, and worst of all, Kurt Godel showed that some theorems are actually undecidable--that is to say, it is impossible even to decide whether or not a theorem is true.Singh recounts a fascinating story of the gifted mathematician, Paul Wolfskehl. He was very depressed, and decided to commit suicide on a particular night, at midnight. While waiting for that time to arrive, he started to read about the failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He became so engrossed in the subject, that he worked well past midnight. He found a gap in the logic of a predecessor, and was so proud of himself that he gained a new desire for life. And, in his will he established a fund of 100,000 marks to be given to the mathematician who first completes the proof of the theorem!Much of the book describes how Andrew Wiles developed a growing interest in the theorem. He worked in almost total isolation for seven years, in order not to be distracted. He occasionally published little tidbits unrelated to his real endeavor, in order to dispel suspicions about what his real work entailed.The central piece of the proof entailed proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, that linked modular forms with elliptic equations. This was a linkage between two far-flung branches of mathematics that seemed to be totally unrelated. To prove the conjecture would allow incredible advances to be made. And then, Ken Ribet showed that a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would, in effect, be a direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But many people tried and failed to develop the proof. But that is exactly what Andrew Wiles worked on for so many years.I had previously read that during Andrew Wiles' famous lecture, he just casually let the unsuspecting audience know, ""and that is a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."" Well, this book tells a somewhat different story. Most of the audience had heard rumors that the third of Wiles' lectures would be of historical significance. They came prepared with cameras, and took photographs during the lecture. So, it was a surprise, but not a total surprise.After Wiles' manuscript of the proof was sent to a publisher, six mathematicians reviewed it, and a crucial gap was found in it. Wiles worked furiously for a nightmarish year, and with the help of Richard Taylor, finally closed the gap. Today, Wiles is recognized as the one who developed the proof. But it is clear, that Wiles ""stood on the shoulders of giants""; he used--and developed--mathematical techniques that had not existed just a few decades previously.Simon Singh writes with a wonderful style. It is clear, not too jargon-heavy but contains enough mathematical ""meat"" to seem satisfying. The book is followed by ten appendixes that contain more details about some of the mathematics; they are not overly technical, and give the reader a better understanding of some of the issues. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in math. "
151,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"Before delving into the book itself, I thought I’d start things off by introducing the problem it’s concerned with, just in case you aren’t already familiar with it.So, what exactly is Fermat’s Last Theorem? Well, basically, this is it: As you can see, the conjecture is quite easy to understand, and yet, believe it or not, it was so remarkably difficult to prove that it took over 350 years to accomplish! The fact that Fermat (teasingly?) scribbled this rather infuriating note in the margin only added to the frustration felt by the scores of mathematicians who did battle with it over the centuries: “I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.”No doubt the cheeky bastard would’ve enjoyed Twitter:Okay, now that that’s been taken care of, it’s time to look at the actual book.What Kind of Book is Fermat’s Enigma?Simply put, Fermat’s Enigma is a history book. It is most definitely NOT a math book, so don’t expect to find any degree of mathematical rigor or complexity here. There are a handful of fairly simple proofs included in the appendices, but overall, the concepts under discussion are glossed over in a superficial manner, never examined in any kind of detail. If you want something that fleshes out how the proof actually works, I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere. (Singh was kind enough to include quite a few “further reading suggestions” at the end of this book. While I’ve not looked into any of the titles he recommended, I assume many of those might prove more to your liking if you prefer a “math book” on the subject.)In any case, while Singh did not pursue the actual mathematics in any real sense, he did positively excel at telling the story of an utterly fascinating struggle, one which spanned hundreds of years and ensnared countless brilliant, talented minds. Readers make the acquaintance of such notable mathematicians as Pythagoras (whose work paved the way for Fermat), Leonhard Euler, Paul Wolfskehl, Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Evariste Galois, Yutaka Taniyama, Goro Shimura, and of course Andrew Wiles, the man, the myth, the legend who finally proved the damn thing. Overall, I was surprised and delighted by just how compelling the story actually was. For me, this book quickly became a veritable page-turner, one I was loathe to put aside. Some may argue that in order to accomplish this, he omitted too much relevant information, that he sacrificed depth for readability. Perhaps this is true to an extent, but in my opinion, while it was admittedly easy to read and follow, it still managed to include a fair amount of pertinent, interesting material. More importantly, it never got bogged down with unnecessary details or lost in minutiae, and never meandered down exasperating tangents, as many otherwise outstanding history books are wont to do. And ultimately, what made this book so very stimulating was that the manner in which the story was told really made it come alive. Singh bestowed a truly suspenseful, exciting quest upon the reader, one full of twists and turns, and even *gasp* its fair share of drama. He enthusiastically demonstrated just how action-packed and exhilarating the life of the mind can be. And for accomplishing this tremendous feat, I heartily recommend the book, warts and all.And Now, For a Few Words on the Star of the ShowAndrew Wiles is an extraordinary human being. Fascinated by Fermat’s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, he vowed to conquer that most impossible of proofs. This was at the age of ten, mind you. I seriously can’t get past that. And then, true to his word, the little rascal grew up to become an eminent mathematician, one who finally went into seclusion for seven years in order to hack away at this tremendous proof. While a not insignificant error marred the first release of said proof, he didn’t let that deter him, but persevered and managed to rectify the error, and, within a couple of years, came out with THE proof. Holy goddamn shit. To me, Wiles’ story was completely and utterly inspiring. I was frankly amazed by what the human mind can achieve; I think I will always be in awe of Wiles’ fierce determination and incredible tenacity. Mad respect. Anyway, as you can probably tell, Andrew Wiles is a personal hero of mine. He is an undeniable, ultimate badass. Wayne and Garth said it best:"

A very trite remark, too lengthy to write in the margin so it is elsewhere, and no one has ever found it or managed to prove his statement, until - - - this book is a brilliant read, you would think it would be as dry as dust, but no! It is a superb account of the proof of the last theorem from Fermat's notebook to be proven. The only thing that still niggles at me, although the mathematical proof is fabulous, it uses modern techniques not available to Fermat, so it is proven but how the hell did Fermat do it??????A brilliant book, beautifully written a tremendous historical question answered in a very modern way, fabulous, well done for readability."

Probably that's just because it's so bloody hard.

155,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This is the kind of book that we non mathematical minds can easily digest and love. It gives you an epic scope of the number of minds that it takes to build new ideas. I doubt if Fermat had actually solved this theorem correctly, but this is impossible to prove. Fermat's theorem however was not impossible to prove! It was solved! Thanks to the efforts of many men (and women!) over many lifetimes and one final man who had the determination and persistence to finish the unthinkable. This book has a lot of wonderful elements, and really exemplifies a love of mathematics. Although if you want to actually understand the theorem this book may not be for you! I can honestly say reading it did not put the theorem in any more digestible light than it started out with. Perhaps it was to the authors advantage to skip the technicalities and focus on the enjoyment of the journey. I personally loved this approach, but it may not be for everyone, especially if you are actually looking to understand the theorem (a massive undertaking that is really not in my repertoire to comment on). "
156,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"What a fun book this was (thanks, Trevor, for the recommendation)! There are many reasons I think I like (good) nonfiction -- a sense of direct relevance, gravitas, frequent insights into the workings of the universe (and people), but mostly for knowledge narcs -- high levels of information density served up into an intriguing package by someone else who has undertaken the heavy lifting (research, organization, thinking). So, here in Singh's work I get a solid lay understanding not only of the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem, but of much of mathematics (and the lives of mathematicians) since the seventeenth century.I've been thinking also about what attracts me to books on mathematical topics -- the works by Martin Gardner, William Poundstone, and the various other authors in the company of whose thoughts I've had pleasure to spend a week or more. What I've come away with, is that the best of them feed off surprises, those bits of counterintuitive anecdotes that leave you blurting out, ""Huh. How about that,"" and then looking madly around for someone to tell. Like a book of jokes, riddles, or puzzles that provides immediate gratification in the back of the book, Fermat's Enigma plugs at least ten conundrums (and their easy-to-understand, logical solutions) into its appendices. For example -- say you're unlucky enough to be forced into a three-way duel. If everyone gets to take turns in order of their skill such that worst shoots first, what should the worst do? Aim at the best in the hopes of getting lucky and eliminating the most dangerous gunsel? Nope, the correct answer is to pass up the turn in the hopes that your first shot will get to be expended against only one remaining combatant. That way, even if you miss, you at least had a chance to take aim at the only person able to shoot back.Pierre Fermat turns out to have been quite the prankster, often tweaking professional mathematicians and academics by mailing them problems they knew full well he had already solved. For those who don't keep this type of trivia at the forefront of their brains, Fermat's the French recluse (and hanging circuit jurist) who once famously scribbled in a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica that x^n + y^n ≠ z^n for any number n greater than 2, a propostion for which he had ""a truly marvelous demonstration… which this margin is too narrow to contain."" This gets to be Fermat's Last Theorem, simply because it ends up being the last of his conundrums to be proven (not necessarily the last one he wrote). Just think, were it not for the scrupulous care taken by Fermat's son to go through and publish all of Fermat, Sr.'s writings, the world would not have been tantalized by this particular gem for 
over 350 YEARS
.Andrew Wiles published the first (and only?) proof in 1994, and Enigma does a tremendous job of walking the reader through not only the stunning depth of his intellectual achievement, but its significance as well. Suffice it to say that I was happy here to read that Taniyama-Shimura get their well-earned due and that modular and elliptical equations can finally be understood to be mathematically analogous (whether or not I have any idea what modular equations actually are). Still, all of this leads to what I think is an even more tantalizing problem. We now know that all of Fermat's conjectures ultimately proved to be solvable and that Fermat's own notes would seem to indicate that he had indeed apparently found ways to solve each of them. But there is no doubt that Fermat's solution could not have relied on the up-to-the-minute maths Wiles employs over 200 pages. So if it was really the limitations of the margin and not of Fermat that inhibited publication… what was Fermat's proof?"
157,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Strap in, guys. I’m going to walk you through the history of how Fermat’s Last Theorum was proved, all in one little (okay, big) review. And I can do this because of this awesome, semi-accessible, frequently tangent-taking, but mostly, this deeply fascinating book.----------STEP ONE: THE THEORUM----------For the unenlightened, Fermat’s Last Theorum is this: you probably know the Pythagorean theorum, a² + b² = c², which explains that if you square the shorter two sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, you get the value of third side squared. This is easily proved (that is, demonstrated to be completely, utterly, logically true via a mathematical proof, using axioms known to be true, which is just like a logic proof if you’ve done philosophy. Or a geometry proof, if you went to 9th grade). Take any triangle, and this will be true. There are infinite solutions to this equation—literally infinite values of A, B, and C which will render this solution true. However, Fermat discovered that the formula an + bn = cn where n > 2 has NO whole number solutions. (Go ahead, give it a whirl. I’ll wait).Then he challenged the mathematical community to create a mathematical proof demonstrating this must be true. While tantalizing them with the knowledge he’d already created a proof for this with a scribbled note in the margin of his notebook: “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Asshole. So sparked centuries of people trying to write this proof, to no avail. Until Professor Andrew Wiles (who has the most apropos name ever—he has wiles indeed) of Cambridge, in 1993.***For clarity, this is Fermat’s Equation (which I’ll refer to as FE): an + bn = cn where n > 2And THIS is Fermat’s Last Theorum (which I’ll refer to as FLT): “There are no solutions to Fermat’s Equation”***----------TANGENT: GODEL----------At this point, it’s been assumed that math is logically perfect—that if you correctly build a proof using axioms (like m + n = n + m), it must be true (and if it’s proven to be true, nothing can prove it to be false). This is known as “axiomatic set theory.” Along came Godel (who is analyzed to death by my beloved, Doug Hofstadter- see here and here). His ideas are as follows: 1. If axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there have to be theorems that can’t be proved or disproved. Why? Because of paradoxes. Godel translated the following statement into mathematical notation: “This statement has no proof.” If that’s false, then you COULD create a proof for that statement—however, that would make the statement false, so how could you have a proof for that? So it has to be true. But if it’s true, it can’t be proved because that’s what it literally says. It’s a mathematical statement that is true, but could never be proved to be true (an “undecidable statement”). 2. There’s no way to prove that axiomatic set theory is consistent; in a way, it’s one of those “undecidable statement” that’s true but can’t be proved to be true. Interestingly, this parallels the physicist Heisenberg’s discovery of the uncertainty principle, but we won’t get into that. Now, there aren’t very many of those undecidable statements. Godel couldn’t really point to any other undecidable statements besides the one above, so people assumed they were found only in the most extreme math and would probably never even be encountered. Welp. A young student named Paul Cohen at Stanford discovered a way to test whether a question is undecidable, and in doing so, discovered several more.Which sparked some fear in mathematicians. What if Fermat’s Last Theorum was undecidable?! What if they were wasting their time trying to prove the unprovable?Interestingly, if it were an undecidable statement, it couldn’t be proved—yet it would have to be true. The theorum says “there are no whole numbers to the equation an + bn = cn where n > 2.” If this were false, then it would be possible to prove this by offering a solution to this—by finding a whole number N that’s greater than 2 that allows the equation to be solved. Which would make it a decidable statement, which is a contradiction. So it can’t be false and also be an undecidable statement. In other words, Fermat’s Last Theorum might be totally true but there might be no way to prove it. ----------STEP TWO: TANIYAMA-SHIMURA CONJECTURE----------Modular forms are a mathematical tool, sort of like impossible forms or shapes, that reveal a lot about how numbers are related. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (TSC), created by two Japanese mathematicians (one of whom tragically and abruptly killed himself quite young) says every modular form is related to a specific elliptic equation (elliptic equations were Andrew Wiles’s main area of study; they’re a type of equation, not super important that you understand them). The fact that these were unified meant there’s a kind of Rosetta stone that’s been discovered: “Simple intuitions in the modular world translate into deep truths in the elliptic world, and vice versa. Very profound problems in the elliptic world can get solved sometimes by translating them using this Rosetta stone into the modular world, and discovering that we have the insights and tools in the modular world to treat the translated problem. Back in the elliptic world we would have been at a loss.”Beyond that awesomeness, the TSC suggests something even more interesting: that possibly all of mathematics, all the different worlds of mathematics, might have parallels in other worlds, as with the elliptic world and the modular world. All of mathematics might be unified—arguably the absolute ultimate goal of abstract mathematics, because this would give us the most complete picture, and the biggest arsenal of tools to solve mathematical problems. ----------STEP THREE: RIBET’S THEORUM----------This is all important for FLT because of something called Ribet’s Theorum (Ribet was a colleague of Wiles). Ribet’s Theorum goes like this: the imagined solution to FE can be translated into an elliptic equation. And that elliptic equation doesn’t seem to have a modular world equivalent. But the TSC claims that every elliptic equation must be related to a modular form. So if you can PROVE that the elliptic form of the solution to FE has no modular form (which we can! The proof was done in 1986), the following is true: if the TSC is true (i.e. all elliptic equations have modular forms), and the elliptic form of the imagined solution to FE has no modular form, then the imagined solution cannot exist, proving FLT. So now, all we have to do is prove that the TSC is true, and FLT is automatically proven to be true. And this—THIS—is what Andrew Wiles focused on. Proving the TSC (Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture).----------STEP FOUR: PROVING THE THEORUM----------Wiles finally succeeded when he applied a new method called the Kolyvagin-Flach method, which groups elliptic equations into families and then proves that an elliptic equation in that family has a modular form; if that elliptic equation has a modular form, then all other elliptic equations in that family also has a modular form. However, the Kolyvagin-Flach method has to be adapted for each family of elliptic equations. Wiles successfully adapted the method for all families of elliptic equations, thereby proving that all elliptic equations have modular forms (which, as a reminder, is basis of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and proving the TSC proves FLT). Two months before I was born, in 1993, he proved FLT in a series of 3 lectures. Kinda. Actually, there was a minor flaw in his proof (essentially, he might have failed to properly adapt the Kolyvagin-Flach method for some of the families of equations) but it doesn’t really matter because a year later, Wiles published a work-around to that flaw, so he proved FLT once and for all. ----------CONCLUSION----------All I can think about is: maybe if math looked like this, if THIS had been our material in high school—maybe then I wouldn’t have disliked it. Maybe other people wouldn’t, either. What a shoddy job we do teaching our children the wonder of learning."
158,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This book is as interesting as a detective story while being about quite advanced mathematics - as such it is quite a book showing the remarkable skill of its writer to explain complex ideas in ways that are always readable and enjoyable.A mathematician finds a simple proof to what seems like a deceptively simple problem of mathematics - that pythagoras's theorem only works if the terms are squared, and not if they are any other power up to infinity. Sounds dull. Except that the mathematician jots down that he has found this proof, but not what the proof is. And for hundredsd of years the greatest minds in mathematics have tried to find this simple proof and been beaten by the problem time and again.This really is a delightful book and one that gives an insight into how mathematicians think about the world. The proof of Pythagoras's theorem given in this book is so simple that the beauty of mathematical proof is made plain to everyone. Just a little knowledge of algebra is needed for this part of the book - the rest requires no maths at all."

160,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,3,"I never watched any documentaries before going to college (and this was about a century and a half ago.. I am getting old -_-. But yeah, 2009 to be precise). I was always interested in NatGeo and History Channel - but they never showed the real deal on television. The documentaries would be mostly half assed, and at worst, total crap. That's also how Indian television landscape can be broadly categorized too, give or take a few exceptions ofcourse. And so I grew up loving the sciences based on what was taught in school curriculum, and elsewhere what I read on the slow 64-bit internet connection.And then college happened. Parents got me my own laptop - and the college intranet had a ton of stuff that other students shared. That place and that time - was where my love for documentaries was born. I had never been so fascinated with anything before. And the first two that I watched - in a long line of them - were Einstein's Biggest Blunder and BBC's Fermat's Last Theorem. The memory of that sunday afternoon is still pretty fresh. Back then, I only had a casual interest in astronomy and cosmology, and Einstein's theories were still something exotic. And so I basically understood jackshit from the first documentary. Even more intrigued than before, I started the second one. Fermat's Last Theorem was much more relatable - I had known the theorem, and understood the concept too. Years later when I joined goodreads, I found out that there was a book too. Keeping in with the tradition of firsts, it became the first book on my TBR pile too. Where it stayed until a few days ago - and I finally marked it as read last night. To be honest, this isn't the greatest book ever. It isnt even Simon Singh's best, who delivered the goods the much better in Big Bang. But it surely captures the essence of all mathematical and scientific endeavor very well - That every once in a while, in the middle of an ordinary life, science gives us a fairytale"

What held me back is what will probably put a lot of other potential readers off trying it - the boring old ""I'm no good at maths"" argument. Although my maths education is probably little above average (a good O Level and a terrible A Level, after which I rallied somewhat to obtain a reasonable HNC maths module) it's //very// many years out of use and it's all I can do to add two numbers up in my head. Given that this book is about a problem that flummoxed the best mathematical minds in the world for over 350 years you'd be forgiven for putting this back on the shelf and choosing something a little simpler. Well, don't even try that... YOU DON'T NEED ANY MATHS TO READ THIS! What Singh has done here is to present a hugely complex subject in a hugely entertaining way. The search for the answer to Fermat's riddle reads like a detective story and not a matehematical treatise and it includes a truly absorbing potted history of the development of maths over the years and, from Pythagoras to Fermat to Godel to Wiles, each part has a fascinating human side to it. Budding mathematicians needn't feel left out as the mechanics of the maths is also included, but it's treated in a gentle way: each step of the problem (and it's solution) is described in a simplified (but certainly not dumbed down) manner and some simple exercises are included in several short appendices. However, take heart! There are several places where elements of the maths are obviously too complex for us mortals and Singh is not afraid to say soo and then gloss over them completely. That may be a disappointment to some, but it's not at all unreasonable in my opinion. All in all, the net result is a book that is sensitive to its readers, intelligent, interesting and important. It's literally unputdownable and it had the added bonus of tricking me into thinking that I'm a little cleverer than I really am. I notice there's an inevitable Wills and Kate bio on the bestseller list at the moment. Put your hard earned cash into Andrew Morton's pockets or read something that will make you feel like a genius. The choice is yours."

It tells the story of one of the (apparently) simplest theorems ever but having one of the hardest possible proofs in mathematics, and how it eventually gets to be proven (around 350 years later!), with admirable simplicity. But most importantly, it shows people the beauty of mathematics. 5/5."
163,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A fantastically entertaining and educational book about the quest to solve the oldest math problem: Fermat's Last Theorem. The intrigue, mystery, and drama surrounding the famous theorem without a proof (but that Fermat had said he had a proof for, just not enough space to write it in the margins) is exciting enough. All the math greats who have attempted to solve it but come up a little short, or a lot short.But it's much more than that, since the final proof of Fermat's Theorem involves so many other math concepts. This book starts and ends with Fermat, but in the middle it is more like a grand tour of all the mathematical developments that make the proof even possible. It's interesting to read about all the different dead ends and other productive findings (that had tangentially made it a little more possible to solve Fermat, but whose main contribution was in some other area). Also, reading about Galois's amazing life always makes me giddy. I mean, I've read about him before, but his story is just so crazy--math genius turned revolutionary thrown in jail involved in affair ends in duel, scribbles out his last thoughts the night before he dies... amazing.But don't expect to understand how the proof actually works by the end. The proof itself is over 100 pages, so there is no way a normal non-math genius can understand it. But you will get a general idea of the approach/trajectory/style of the final beast. Also, some of the math concepts leading up to it are quite easily comprehensible. I wouldn't recommend this book to a math whiz... it's more of a fun read for the layperson.It would ultimately be more satisfying if the proof were a short elegant thing that didn't involve latest groundbreaking discoveries in math. But maybe the bright side is that we can still wonder about Fermat's original (alleged) proof that was never written down. It had to be different from Andrew Wile's proof; does it exist? Or was Fermat bluffing? Or did he make an error in his proof?"

It chronicles the life and works of not just Fermat, but most of the mathematicians having even a tiny bit to do with the conjecture/theorem. Curious and strange revelations into the lives of many of the princes and princesses of mathematics are presented. It presents the case of lives, pursuits and the times that they lived in. The problems that they face (mathematical and others), how these affect the progress/decline of the field. Simon Singh writes brilliantly mixing accounts of math behind the problem along with the lives of these mathematicians. We get to see accounts of love, suicides, suicide averted by fixating on a proof, duels and revolutionaries. For me it was shocking to know, that it was not just the kings and religious fellows destroying these geniuses and their sanctuaries, but Pythagoras also committed a grave mistake once, sentencing Hippasus to death for arguing that sqrt(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction!A must read for those interested in history behind the problem."

The author never tries to overwhelm us with the mathematics, but tells us about the people who were involved in proving the theorem. Having said that, all the mathematics in the book can be understood with a background in high school mathematics. This book is a great read simply because of the intellectual achievement that it talks about. Strongly recommended if you're remotely interested in mathematics."

The words in this book were used for telling a story about numbers, which made me realize I also love numbers so much, I just didn’t know. Math had always been the “easy subject” at school for me, the one which did not require long hours of study, because it was so logical, the one you could check before turning in an exam and know you had the right answers precisely because it matched so perfectly. “Proof is what lies at the heart of maths.”, indeed, so simple, so beautiful. Well, this story is, as the title describes, a true quest to solve one of the most difficult problems in Mathematics which Fermat’s Last Theorem used to be. Simon Singh did this superbly. He is absolutely great at explaining from whole numbers and 1+1 to elliptical equations and modular forms. But the best was to learn about some of the greatest minds that worked so hard in the last century solving problems and doing the maths that have been the basis and tool for proving this theorem and thus, their great contribution to science: Pythagoras and his controversial Pythagorean Brotherhood, Mersenne, Euclid, Diophantus and his most remarkable “Arithmetica”, of course Pierre de Fermat, Pascal, brilliant Euler, Cantor, Sophie Germain, Theano, Hypatia, Maria Agnesi, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Cauchy, Lamè, Kummer, Wolfskehl, Gödel, Turing, Shimura, Taniyama, and Andrew Wiles. These are not the only ones, of course, but the most outstanding for me from this book. I want to make a special mention to the part where Singh talks about the work of women that were mathematicians. Even as of today, there aren’t many of us women dedicated to numbers or number theory, but we have come to a time when we can actually pursue this career, despite the struggles and obstacles that still exist in our societies. But being a mathematician a few centuries ago was completely outrageous and out of this world! Sophie Germain had to study secretly at night and keep a secret stock of candles to do so, because her dad used to confiscate them to prevent her from studying. Or Agnesi who was referred to as the “witch of Agnesi”. And the most extreme of these was Hypatia of Alexandria who suffered the most tragic and brutal death to the hands of the exulted mob led by the patriarch of Alexandria because she was considered a heretic. These stories really moved me and I’m very glad that their names are remembered and admired although they did not have a voice in their own time. Their only voice was their endless curiosity and passion for trying to understand the Universe and their brilliant work pervaded through history and remained printed in our books and forever in our memories, a greatly deserved honor to inspire all of us. And back to Fermat’s Theorem, Wiles amazing work on his childhood’s dream inspired this book and will hopefully inspire many more that see the beauty of numbers to keep working and pushing the frontiers on this science field which Singh perfectly describes as the “language of nature”."

If he had it with the tools available at his time, then it still remains an enigma. Simon Singh brings to us this wonderful story in a brilliant way. "

I don't do mathematics and haven't studied anything beyond the bare minimum required for a Bachelor's degree, but I find something wonderful about the pursuits of people like Andrew Wiles and the number theorists who spend years of their lives working on a set of problems. Wiles's obsessive mindset and solitary quest reminded of Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season"" and I wonder if Carlson read this or another account of Wiles's eight-year project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem? (From ""Towel Season"":)When they were dating, he'd begun to try to explain his work to her in metaphors, and she'd continued the game through his career, asking him for comparisons that she'd then inhabit, embellish. Right after they were married and Edison was in graduate school, he'd work late into the night in their apartment and crawl into bed with the calculations still percolating in his head. ""What's it like?"" Leslie would ask. ""Where are you now?"" She could tell he was remote, lit. They talked in territories.""I've crossed all the open ground, and the wind has stopped now. My hope is to find a way through this next place.""""Mountains?""""Right. Okay, mountains--blank, very few markings."" He spoke carefully and with a quiet zeal. ""They're steep, hard to see.""""Is it cold?""""No, but it is strange. It's quiet."" Then he'd turn to her in bed, his eyes bright, alive. ""I'm way past the path. I don't think anyone has climbed this route before. There are no trails, handholds.""Leslie would smile and kiss him in that close proximity. ""Keep going,"" she'd say. ""Halfway up that mountain, there's a woman with a cappuccino cart and a chicken-salad sandwich--me.""Then a smile would break across his face, too, and he would see her, kiss her back, and say it: ""Right. You.""A book has yet to fulfill my odd wish to peek over the shoulder of a mathematician working on a problem like Fermat's Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. Until a science writer like Singh explained it in metaphors and broad concepts I wouldn't understand what the mathematician was doing, but wouldn't it be weirdly magical to observe!"

173,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"well, the main thing i took from this book is probably that maths is a field for privileged white men. you have to be rich enough to be able to live comfortably while devoting their life to solving a centuries-old problem simply because they think proving it would be ""satisfying"". you must also be white - or at least living in the west - so that you are actually recognized for your work, otherwise your work will be spotted by someone who lives in the west who will take credit for it. and you must be male. obviously. the politics of the world of mathematics is interesting stuff folks. anyway, it's an alright book. very informative n clear (most of the time). also pretty funny. although i would recommend the 1st half of the book to pretty much anyone, it does sort of get a bit jargon-y and vague by the end. i still enjoyed it, but not at much as i did the first half. i did find the lack of dates for all the events a bit annoying. singh often jumped from event to event, without giving his readers a very good timeline of happenings. aaaanyway. i still learnt a lot from this book. and it's very engaging. if you're interested at all in the history of mathematics, i would definitely recommend. it doesn't really tell you how to solve fermat's last theorem (you'd have to read a 200 page paper to find out sorry), but it gives you a pretty good overview of how mathematicians collectively got there. while also including a couple maths puzzles and a collection of proofs in the back <3 (i love proofs)"

The narration flows like acetone. The book starts with the climax moment of a 358 year old struggle “Fermat's last theorem”. Singh's writing style paints the whole view (awestruck people, ecstatic protagonist, exuberant surroundings) in front of your eyes. Singh is successful in seizing reader's undivided attention when he recounts the moment when the seed of this curiosity was sown in 10yr. old Wile's mind. And then, starts the roller coaster ride of the great minds who faced the thunderstorms and sunshine in Mathematical history. This book is no less than a time travel machine, which takes us to the ancient Egypt where this beguiling discipline spent its babyhood . Then the journey proceeds era by era, riddle by riddle from 3000 BC to the auspicious day when Wiles finally bid adieu to his childhood dream. Before I could even realize, I was already there with the great mathematicians, feeling the euphoria of slaughtering a puzzle, the frustration of long struggles, standing against the whole world for the love of Mathematics. Reading experience is elevated 1000 folds by the introduction of small mathematical teasers in between the chapters, when a highly motivated mathematician hidden in you will jump to iron it out. Singh takes us through the history of Mathematics related to FLT chronologically depicting many interesting stories. By the time you reach the ending, you are so engrossed in this world that you can experience the pain in the predicaments faced by Andrew Wiles. You will be able to empathize with the setbacks, hopes and tussles Wiles faced when his childhood dream was about to shatter after making it almost there!Best part of the book is “The return of Wiles”, the scenes from “The Dark Knight Rises” running alongside in my mind. One real life example of the victory of the “Never say die” doctrine. Truly mentioned in Daily Mail - “story of an obsessive love affair”!A must read for every enigma lover!"

Unfortunately, so was this book and my quest continues. Nonetheless, this book is very interesting and well written, and shows you how many things that appear to be simple and almost intuitive can be incredibly complex (that's what's so beautiful about math). In situations like this, people always tend to give all the praise to people like Andrew Wiles, without realizing on how much work and discoveries made by other people his work relies on. And even though Wiles deserves all the fame and recognition he can get for his persistence and determination, it's nice to see all the other great mathematicians who greatly contributed being mentioned. Like old saying goes: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes, and if anything, by showing how complex the proof is, it leaves you wondering, did the Fermat really have the solution?If you are only slightly interested in mathematics and were just curious about this certain topic and ideas on which the proof was based on, or are looking for a good place to start, I would definitively recommend this book. But to be fair, you can get all of that by watching previously mentioned documentary and it would cost you much less time. On the other hand, if you want something more complex and mathematical, you won't get it here."

It conveys perfectly to a layman the sense of accomplishment that the mathematical community associates with cracking the proof for this theorem. In that sense, it has the effect of a self-help book even without trying to be one."
177,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299698-pawan,5,"http://iandbooks.wordpress.comIn a way this book “Fermat’s Last Theorem” is a fantasy come true. To be able to read about complex Mathematics in a story book style is something that was possible only in this book by Simon Singh. Before I picked up this book I had no idea about Fermat’s last theorem or its significance. I just read the summary on the back page and felt like picking up the book and once I started reading it, there was no stopping it, though I did skipped over complex mathematical equations part.Fermat’s last theorem states that no set of positive three integers exist such thatan + bn = cnis satisfied for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and he claimed in his writing that he had a proof of this theorem but he did not have space left on the paper on which he was writing at that time. After his death hundreds of Mathematicians across the world tried unsuccessfully for many centuries to get the generic proof but the final proof was found only in 1995. Even though the proof has been found it is based on very complex mathematical models that were not in existence during Fermat’s time. So, it is still a mystery, how Fermat had that proof that was very simple.The book traces this history of Fermat’s last theorem. It is a fascinating story of how the best minds could not figure out something that was done by Fermat such a long time ago. The significance of this theorem is not that it brings some new understanding to the world of Mathematics but lies in the simplicity of the theorem and exceedingly complex proof of it."
178,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance,5,"Absolutely fantastic.The descriptions of all the maths and discoveries in this book are nothing short of joyful, and I felt so excited to be reading all of it. The book explains and shows why math is so amazing, how it is a divine language that describes something (i.e., number properties and their relationships) that exists outside of the physical world, how mathematicians are then often more in search of a truth in the real sense of the word than in search of a practical application or an explanation, how math discoveries can be magical and fulfilling and immortal in that they are untouched by human perception. My heart literally started beating faster when I saw the published first page of the proof. The book does a great job of conveying a narrative arc and giving background when necessary, and in presenting a pretty complicated topic in an accessible but not-dumbed down way. (Although in the U.S. the title of the book was changed to “Fermat’s Enigma,"" sigh.)Also, quite charmingly, one of the major turning points in the book is a conversation at Cafe Strada in which someone exclaims, “But don’t you see? You’ve done it! All you have to do is add some gamma-zero of (M) structure and just run through your argument and it works. It gives you everything you need.”I learned that mathematicians are big weirdos, and that they like to chat each other up at tea every day. I also learned that 10^10^10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics.”Thanks for the rec Sue!"

There is just enough information in it for a layman to know sufficiently about the Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof to be able to boast at a coffee table discussion with friends. And that's all.While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the poof of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view that is sometimes a bit arguable and of course oversimplified. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably. Trying to condense the basic ideas of the comprehensive proof that only few top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. Still I feel that the essence should have been in the math, but the reader gets instead a inspiring story, about a man's zealous quest for an absolute truth."
180,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Simon Singh has the ability to present a story about a mathematics problem, and tell it like a detective story. He makes the subject exciting, even though the outcome is well known. Singh intersperses history with discussions about the mathematics, and makes it quite understandable. Singh starts with the roots of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, by recounting the stories and mathematics of Pythagoras, Euclid, and Euler. Other, less well-known mathematicians are also given credit, for example Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin Cauchy, and Evariste Galois. Three hundred fifty years ago, Fermat wrote the following theorem in the margin of a mathematics book:  And, Fermat wrote that he had a marvelous proof, but no room in the margin for it. For centuries, mathematicians have attempted to prove the theorem, without success. It had been sort of a ""holy grail"" of mathematicians to prove the theorem, and many brilliant minds spent years on it. Perhaps in was unprovable, and worst of all, Kurt Godel showed that some theorems are actually undecidable--that is to say, it is impossible even to decide whether or not a theorem is true.Singh recounts a fascinating story of the gifted mathematician, Paul Wolfskehl. He was very depressed, and decided to commit suicide on a particular night, at midnight. While waiting for that time to arrive, he started to read about the failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He became so engrossed in the subject, that he worked well past midnight. He found a gap in the logic of a predecessor, and was so proud of himself that he gained a new desire for life. And, in his will he established a fund of 100,000 marks to be given to the mathematician who first completes the proof of the theorem!Much of the book describes how Andrew Wiles developed a growing interest in the theorem. He worked in almost total isolation for seven years, in order not to be distracted. He occasionally published little tidbits unrelated to his real endeavor, in order to dispel suspicions about what his real work entailed.The central piece of the proof entailed proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, that linked modular forms with elliptic equations. This was a linkage between two far-flung branches of mathematics that seemed to be totally unrelated. To prove the conjecture would allow incredible advances to be made. And then, Ken Ribet showed that a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would, in effect, be a direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But many people tried and failed to develop the proof. But that is exactly what Andrew Wiles worked on for so many years.I had previously read that during Andrew Wiles' famous lecture, he just casually let the unsuspecting audience know, ""and that is a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."" Well, this book tells a somewhat different story. Most of the audience had heard rumors that the third of Wiles' lectures would be of historical significance. They came prepared with cameras, and took photographs during the lecture. So, it was a surprise, but not a total surprise.After Wiles' manuscript of the proof was sent to a publisher, six mathematicians reviewed it, and a crucial gap was found in it. Wiles worked furiously for a nightmarish year, and with the help of Richard Taylor, finally closed the gap. Today, Wiles is recognized as the one who developed the proof. But it is clear, that Wiles ""stood on the shoulders of giants""; he used--and developed--mathematical techniques that had not existed just a few decades previously.Simon Singh writes with a wonderful style. It is clear, not too jargon-heavy but contains enough mathematical ""meat"" to seem satisfying. The book is followed by ten appendixes that contain more details about some of the mathematics; they are not overly technical, and give the reader a better understanding of some of the issues. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in math. "
181,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"Before delving into the book itself, I thought I’d start things off by introducing the problem it’s concerned with, just in case you aren’t already familiar with it.So, what exactly is Fermat’s Last Theorem? Well, basically, this is it: As you can see, the conjecture is quite easy to understand, and yet, believe it or not, it was so remarkably difficult to prove that it took over 350 years to accomplish! The fact that Fermat (teasingly?) scribbled this rather infuriating note in the margin only added to the frustration felt by the scores of mathematicians who did battle with it over the centuries: “I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.”No doubt the cheeky bastard would’ve enjoyed Twitter:Okay, now that that’s been taken care of, it’s time to look at the actual book.What Kind of Book is Fermat’s Enigma?Simply put, Fermat’s Enigma is a history book. It is most definitely NOT a math book, so don’t expect to find any degree of mathematical rigor or complexity here. There are a handful of fairly simple proofs included in the appendices, but overall, the concepts under discussion are glossed over in a superficial manner, never examined in any kind of detail. If you want something that fleshes out how the proof actually works, I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere. (Singh was kind enough to include quite a few “further reading suggestions” at the end of this book. While I’ve not looked into any of the titles he recommended, I assume many of those might prove more to your liking if you prefer a “math book” on the subject.)In any case, while Singh did not pursue the actual mathematics in any real sense, he did positively excel at telling the story of an utterly fascinating struggle, one which spanned hundreds of years and ensnared countless brilliant, talented minds. Readers make the acquaintance of such notable mathematicians as Pythagoras (whose work paved the way for Fermat), Leonhard Euler, Paul Wolfskehl, Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Evariste Galois, Yutaka Taniyama, Goro Shimura, and of course Andrew Wiles, the man, the myth, the legend who finally proved the damn thing. Overall, I was surprised and delighted by just how compelling the story actually was. For me, this book quickly became a veritable page-turner, one I was loathe to put aside. Some may argue that in order to accomplish this, he omitted too much relevant information, that he sacrificed depth for readability. Perhaps this is true to an extent, but in my opinion, while it was admittedly easy to read and follow, it still managed to include a fair amount of pertinent, interesting material. More importantly, it never got bogged down with unnecessary details or lost in minutiae, and never meandered down exasperating tangents, as many otherwise outstanding history books are wont to do. And ultimately, what made this book so very stimulating was that the manner in which the story was told really made it come alive. Singh bestowed a truly suspenseful, exciting quest upon the reader, one full of twists and turns, and even *gasp* its fair share of drama. He enthusiastically demonstrated just how action-packed and exhilarating the life of the mind can be. And for accomplishing this tremendous feat, I heartily recommend the book, warts and all.And Now, For a Few Words on the Star of the ShowAndrew Wiles is an extraordinary human being. Fascinated by Fermat’s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, he vowed to conquer that most impossible of proofs. This was at the age of ten, mind you. I seriously can’t get past that. And then, true to his word, the little rascal grew up to become an eminent mathematician, one who finally went into seclusion for seven years in order to hack away at this tremendous proof. While a not insignificant error marred the first release of said proof, he didn’t let that deter him, but persevered and managed to rectify the error, and, within a couple of years, came out with THE proof. Holy goddamn shit. To me, Wiles’ story was completely and utterly inspiring. I was frankly amazed by what the human mind can achieve; I think I will always be in awe of Wiles’ fierce determination and incredible tenacity. Mad respect. Anyway, as you can probably tell, Andrew Wiles is a personal hero of mine. He is an undeniable, ultimate badass. Wayne and Garth said it best:"

It is a superb account of the proof of the last theorem from Fermat's notebook to be proven. The only thing that still niggles at me, although the mathematical proof is fabulous, it uses modern techniques not available to Fermat, so it is proven but how the hell did Fermat do it??????A brilliant book, beautifully written a tremendous historical question answered in a very modern way, fabulous, well done for readability."

It gives you an epic scope of the number of minds that it takes to build new ideas. I doubt if Fermat had actually solved this theorem correctly, but this is impossible to prove. Fermat's theorem however was not impossible to prove! It was solved! Thanks to the efforts of many men (and women!) over many lifetimes and one final man who had the determination and persistence to finish the unthinkable. This book has a lot of wonderful elements, and really exemplifies a love of mathematics. Although if you want to actually understand the theorem this book may not be for you! I can honestly say reading it did not put the theorem in any more digestible light than it started out with. Perhaps it was to the authors advantage to skip the technicalities and focus on the enjoyment of the journey. I personally loved this approach, but it may not be for everyone, especially if you are actually looking to understand the theorem (a massive undertaking that is really not in my repertoire to comment on). "
186,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"What a fun book this was (thanks, Trevor, for the recommendation)! There are many reasons I think I like (good) nonfiction -- a sense of direct relevance, gravitas, frequent insights into the workings of the universe (and people), but mostly for knowledge narcs -- high levels of information density served up into an intriguing package by someone else who has undertaken the heavy lifting (research, organization, thinking). So, here in Singh's work I get a solid lay understanding not only of the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem, but of much of mathematics (and the lives of mathematicians) since the seventeenth century.I've been thinking also about what attracts me to books on mathematical topics -- the works by Martin Gardner, William Poundstone, and the various other authors in the company of whose thoughts I've had pleasure to spend a week or more. What I've come away with, is that the best of them feed off surprises, those bits of counterintuitive anecdotes that leave you blurting out, ""Huh. How about that,"" and then looking madly around for someone to tell. Like a book of jokes, riddles, or puzzles that provides immediate gratification in the back of the book, Fermat's Enigma plugs at least ten conundrums (and their easy-to-understand, logical solutions) into its appendices. For example -- say you're unlucky enough to be forced into a three-way duel. If everyone gets to take turns in order of their skill such that worst shoots first, what should the worst do? Aim at the best in the hopes of getting lucky and eliminating the most dangerous gunsel? Nope, the correct answer is to pass up the turn in the hopes that your first shot will get to be expended against only one remaining combatant. That way, even if you miss, you at least had a chance to take aim at the only person able to shoot back.Pierre Fermat turns out to have been quite the prankster, often tweaking professional mathematicians and academics by mailing them problems they knew full well he had already solved. For those who don't keep this type of trivia at the forefront of their brains, Fermat's the French recluse (and hanging circuit jurist) who once famously scribbled in a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica that x^n + y^n ≠ z^n for any number n greater than 2, a propostion for which he had ""a truly marvelous demonstration… which this margin is too narrow to contain."" This gets to be Fermat's Last Theorem, simply because it ends up being the last of his conundrums to be proven (not necessarily the last one he wrote). Just think, were it not for the scrupulous care taken by Fermat's son to go through and publish all of Fermat, Sr.'s writings, the world would not have been tantalized by this particular gem for 
over 350 YEARS
.Andrew Wiles published the first (and only?) proof in 1994, and Enigma does a tremendous job of walking the reader through not only the stunning depth of his intellectual achievement, but its significance as well. Suffice it to say that I was happy here to read that Taniyama-Shimura get their well-earned due and that modular and elliptical equations can finally be understood to be mathematically analogous (whether or not I have any idea what modular equations actually are). Still, all of this leads to what I think is an even more tantalizing problem. We now know that all of Fermat's conjectures ultimately proved to be solvable and that Fermat's own notes would seem to indicate that he had indeed apparently found ways to solve each of them. But there is no doubt that Fermat's solution could not have relied on the up-to-the-minute maths Wiles employs over 200 pages. So if it was really the limitations of the margin and not of Fermat that inhibited publication… what was Fermat's proof?"
187,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Strap in, guys. I’m going to walk you through the history of how Fermat’s Last Theorum was proved, all in one little (okay, big) review. And I can do this because of this awesome, semi-accessible, frequently tangent-taking, but mostly, this deeply fascinating book.----------STEP ONE: THE THEORUM----------For the unenlightened, Fermat’s Last Theorum is this: you probably know the Pythagorean theorum, a² + b² = c², which explains that if you square the shorter two sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, you get the value of third side squared. This is easily proved (that is, demonstrated to be completely, utterly, logically true via a mathematical proof, using axioms known to be true, which is just like a logic proof if you’ve done philosophy. Or a geometry proof, if you went to 9th grade). Take any triangle, and this will be true. There are infinite solutions to this equation—literally infinite values of A, B, and C which will render this solution true. However, Fermat discovered that the formula an + bn = cn where n > 2 has NO whole number solutions. (Go ahead, give it a whirl. I’ll wait).Then he challenged the mathematical community to create a mathematical proof demonstrating this must be true. While tantalizing them with the knowledge he’d already created a proof for this with a scribbled note in the margin of his notebook: “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Asshole. So sparked centuries of people trying to write this proof, to no avail. Until Professor Andrew Wiles (who has the most apropos name ever—he has wiles indeed) of Cambridge, in 1993.***For clarity, this is Fermat’s Equation (which I’ll refer to as FE): an + bn = cn where n > 2And THIS is Fermat’s Last Theorum (which I’ll refer to as FLT): “There are no solutions to Fermat’s Equation”***----------TANGENT: GODEL----------At this point, it’s been assumed that math is logically perfect—that if you correctly build a proof using axioms (like m + n = n + m), it must be true (and if it’s proven to be true, nothing can prove it to be false). This is known as “axiomatic set theory.” Along came Godel (who is analyzed to death by my beloved, Doug Hofstadter- see here and here). His ideas are as follows: 1. If axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there have to be theorems that can’t be proved or disproved. Why? Because of paradoxes. Godel translated the following statement into mathematical notation: “This statement has no proof.” If that’s false, then you COULD create a proof for that statement—however, that would make the statement false, so how could you have a proof for that? So it has to be true. But if it’s true, it can’t be proved because that’s what it literally says. It’s a mathematical statement that is true, but could never be proved to be true (an “undecidable statement”). 2. There’s no way to prove that axiomatic set theory is consistent; in a way, it’s one of those “undecidable statement” that’s true but can’t be proved to be true. Interestingly, this parallels the physicist Heisenberg’s discovery of the uncertainty principle, but we won’t get into that. Now, there aren’t very many of those undecidable statements. Godel couldn’t really point to any other undecidable statements besides the one above, so people assumed they were found only in the most extreme math and would probably never even be encountered. Welp. A young student named Paul Cohen at Stanford discovered a way to test whether a question is undecidable, and in doing so, discovered several more.Which sparked some fear in mathematicians. What if Fermat’s Last Theorum was undecidable?! What if they were wasting their time trying to prove the unprovable?Interestingly, if it were an undecidable statement, it couldn’t be proved—yet it would have to be true. The theorum says “there are no whole numbers to the equation an + bn = cn where n > 2.” If this were false, then it would be possible to prove this by offering a solution to this—by finding a whole number N that’s greater than 2 that allows the equation to be solved. Which would make it a decidable statement, which is a contradiction. So it can’t be false and also be an undecidable statement. In other words, Fermat’s Last Theorum might be totally true but there might be no way to prove it. ----------STEP TWO: TANIYAMA-SHIMURA CONJECTURE----------Modular forms are a mathematical tool, sort of like impossible forms or shapes, that reveal a lot about how numbers are related. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (TSC), created by two Japanese mathematicians (one of whom tragically and abruptly killed himself quite young) says every modular form is related to a specific elliptic equation (elliptic equations were Andrew Wiles’s main area of study; they’re a type of equation, not super important that you understand them). The fact that these were unified meant there’s a kind of Rosetta stone that’s been discovered: “Simple intuitions in the modular world translate into deep truths in the elliptic world, and vice versa. Very profound problems in the elliptic world can get solved sometimes by translating them using this Rosetta stone into the modular world, and discovering that we have the insights and tools in the modular world to treat the translated problem. Back in the elliptic world we would have been at a loss.”Beyond that awesomeness, the TSC suggests something even more interesting: that possibly all of mathematics, all the different worlds of mathematics, might have parallels in other worlds, as with the elliptic world and the modular world. All of mathematics might be unified—arguably the absolute ultimate goal of abstract mathematics, because this would give us the most complete picture, and the biggest arsenal of tools to solve mathematical problems. ----------STEP THREE: RIBET’S THEORUM----------This is all important for FLT because of something called Ribet’s Theorum (Ribet was a colleague of Wiles). Ribet’s Theorum goes like this: the imagined solution to FE can be translated into an elliptic equation. And that elliptic equation doesn’t seem to have a modular world equivalent. But the TSC claims that every elliptic equation must be related to a modular form. So if you can PROVE that the elliptic form of the solution to FE has no modular form (which we can! The proof was done in 1986), the following is true: if the TSC is true (i.e. all elliptic equations have modular forms), and the elliptic form of the imagined solution to FE has no modular form, then the imagined solution cannot exist, proving FLT. So now, all we have to do is prove that the TSC is true, and FLT is automatically proven to be true. And this—THIS—is what Andrew Wiles focused on. Proving the TSC (Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture).----------STEP FOUR: PROVING THE THEORUM----------Wiles finally succeeded when he applied a new method called the Kolyvagin-Flach method, which groups elliptic equations into families and then proves that an elliptic equation in that family has a modular form; if that elliptic equation has a modular form, then all other elliptic equations in that family also has a modular form. However, the Kolyvagin-Flach method has to be adapted for each family of elliptic equations. Wiles successfully adapted the method for all families of elliptic equations, thereby proving that all elliptic equations have modular forms (which, as a reminder, is basis of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and proving the TSC proves FLT). Two months before I was born, in 1993, he proved FLT in a series of 3 lectures. Kinda. Actually, there was a minor flaw in his proof (essentially, he might have failed to properly adapt the Kolyvagin-Flach method for some of the families of equations) but it doesn’t really matter because a year later, Wiles published a work-around to that flaw, so he proved FLT once and for all. ----------CONCLUSION----------All I can think about is: maybe if math looked like this, if THIS had been our material in high school—maybe then I wouldn’t have disliked it. Maybe other people wouldn’t, either. What a shoddy job we do teaching our children the wonder of learning."
188,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This book is as interesting as a detective story while being about quite advanced mathematics - as such it is quite a book showing the remarkable skill of its writer to explain complex ideas in ways that are always readable and enjoyable.A mathematician finds a simple proof to what seems like a deceptively simple problem of mathematics - that pythagoras's theorem only works if the terms are squared, and not if they are any other power up to infinity. Sounds dull. Except that the mathematician jots down that he has found this proof, but not what the proof is. And for hundredsd of years the greatest minds in mathematics have tried to find this simple proof and been beaten by the problem time and again.This really is a delightful book and one that gives an insight into how mathematicians think about the world. The proof of Pythagoras's theorem given in this book is so simple that the beauty of mathematical proof is made plain to everyone. Just a little knowledge of algebra is needed for this part of the book - the rest requires no maths at all."

190,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,3,"I never watched any documentaries before going to college (and this was about a century and a half ago.. I am getting old -_-. But yeah, 2009 to be precise). I was always interested in NatGeo and History Channel - but they never showed the real deal on television. The documentaries would be mostly half assed, and at worst, total crap. That's also how Indian television landscape can be broadly categorized too, give or take a few exceptions ofcourse. And so I grew up loving the sciences based on what was taught in school curriculum, and elsewhere what I read on the slow 64-bit internet connection.And then college happened. Parents got me my own laptop - and the college intranet had a ton of stuff that other students shared. That place and that time - was where my love for documentaries was born. I had never been so fascinated with anything before. And the first two that I watched - in a long line of them - were Einstein's Biggest Blunder and BBC's Fermat's Last Theorem. The memory of that sunday afternoon is still pretty fresh. Back then, I only had a casual interest in astronomy and cosmology, and Einstein's theories were still something exotic. And so I basically understood jackshit from the first documentary. Even more intrigued than before, I started the second one. Fermat's Last Theorem was much more relatable - I had known the theorem, and understood the concept too. Years later when I joined goodreads, I found out that there was a book too. Keeping in with the tradition of firsts, it became the first book on my TBR pile too. Where it stayed until a few days ago - and I finally marked it as read last night. To be honest, this isn't the greatest book ever. It isnt even Simon Singh's best, who delivered the goods the much better in Big Bang. But it surely captures the essence of all mathematical and scientific endeavor very well - That every once in a while, in the middle of an ordinary life, science gives us a fairytale"
191,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,5,"If you buy the latest Jilly Cooper instead of this you WILL go to hell!This one languished on my bookshelf for the best part of a year as I was too scared to pick it up & start it. What held me back is what will probably put a lot of other potential readers off trying it - the boring old ""I'm no good at maths"" argument. Although my maths education is probably little above average (a good O Level and a terrible A Level, after which I rallied somewhat to obtain a reasonable HNC maths module) it's //very// many years out of use and it's all I can do to add two numbers up in my head. Given that this book is about a problem that flummoxed the best mathematical minds in the world for over 350 years you'd be forgiven for putting this back on the shelf and choosing something a little simpler. Well, don't even try that... YOU DON'T NEED ANY MATHS TO READ THIS! What Singh has done here is to present a hugely complex subject in a hugely entertaining way. The search for the answer to Fermat's riddle reads like a detective story and not a matehematical treatise and it includes a truly absorbing potted history of the development of maths over the years and, from Pythagoras to Fermat to Godel to Wiles, each part has a fascinating human side to it. Budding mathematicians needn't feel left out as the mechanics of the maths is also included, but it's treated in a gentle way: each step of the problem (and it's solution) is described in a simplified (but certainly not dumbed down) manner and some simple exercises are included in several short appendices. However, take heart! There are several places where elements of the maths are obviously too complex for us mortals and Singh is not afraid to say soo and then gloss over them completely. That may be a disappointment to some, but it's not at all unreasonable in my opinion. All in all, the net result is a book that is sensitive to its readers, intelligent, interesting and important. It's literally unputdownable and it had the added bonus of tricking me into thinking that I'm a little cleverer than I really am. I notice there's an inevitable Wills and Kate bio on the bestseller list at the moment. Put your hard earned cash into Andrew Morton's pockets or read something that will make you feel like a genius. The choice is yours."
192,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46468957-paul,5,"This is by far the best popular science book I've read. It combines some high quality storytelling worthy of a good thriller with important scenes in the history of mathematics as well as simple explanations of certain mathematical ideas. It tells the story of one of the (apparently) simplest theorems ever but having one of the hardest possible proofs in mathematics, and how it eventually gets to be proven (around 350 years later!), with admirable simplicity. But most importantly, it shows people the beauty of mathematics. 5/5."
193,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A fantastically entertaining and educational book about the quest to solve the oldest math problem: Fermat's Last Theorem. The intrigue, mystery, and drama surrounding the famous theorem without a proof (but that Fermat had said he had a proof for, just not enough space to write it in the margins) is exciting enough. All the math greats who have attempted to solve it but come up a little short, or a lot short.But it's much more than that, since the final proof of Fermat's Theorem involves so many other math concepts. This book starts and ends with Fermat, but in the middle it is more like a grand tour of all the mathematical developments that make the proof even possible. It's interesting to read about all the different dead ends and other productive findings (that had tangentially made it a little more possible to solve Fermat, but whose main contribution was in some other area). Also, reading about Galois's amazing life always makes me giddy. I mean, I've read about him before, but his story is just so crazy--math genius turned revolutionary thrown in jail involved in affair ends in duel, scribbles out his last thoughts the night before he dies... amazing.But don't expect to understand how the proof actually works by the end. The proof itself is over 100 pages, so there is no way a normal non-math genius can understand it. But you will get a general idea of the approach/trajectory/style of the final beast. Also, some of the math concepts leading up to it are quite easily comprehensible. I wouldn't recommend this book to a math whiz... it's more of a fun read for the layperson.It would ultimately be more satisfying if the proof were a short elegant thing that didn't involve latest groundbreaking discoveries in math. But maybe the bright side is that we can still wonder about Fermat's original (alleged) proof that was never written down. It had to be different from Andrew Wile's proof; does it exist? Or was Fermat bluffing? Or did he make an error in his proof?"
194,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962158-rakesh-m,5,"This book is a biography of the epic quest to solve the eluding Fermat's last theorem. It chronicles the life and works of not just Fermat, but most of the mathematicians having even a tiny bit to do with the conjecture/theorem. Curious and strange revelations into the lives of many of the princes and princesses of mathematics are presented. It presents the case of lives, pursuits and the times that they lived in. The problems that they face (mathematical and others), how these affect the progress/decline of the field. Simon Singh writes brilliantly mixing accounts of math behind the problem along with the lives of these mathematicians. We get to see accounts of love, suicides, suicide averted by fixating on a proof, duels and revolutionaries. For me it was shocking to know, that it was not just the kings and religious fellows destroying these geniuses and their sanctuaries, but Pythagoras also committed a grave mistake once, sentencing Hippasus to death for arguing that sqrt(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction!A must read for those interested in history behind the problem."

Starting off with ancient Greeks and arriving at the proof using modern mathematics, he explains the struggles of generations of mathematicians. The author never tries to overwhelm us with the mathematics, but tells us about the people who were involved in proving the theorem. Having said that, all the mathematics in the book can be understood with a background in high school mathematics. This book is a great read simply because of the intellectual achievement that it talks about. Strongly recommended if you're remotely interested in mathematics."
197,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"I have a special love for words. I think I always have. They’re fascinating. The words in this book were used for telling a story about numbers, which made me realize I also love numbers so much, I just didn’t know. Math had always been the “easy subject” at school for me, the one which did not require long hours of study, because it was so logical, the one you could check before turning in an exam and know you had the right answers precisely because it matched so perfectly. “Proof is what lies at the heart of maths.”, indeed, so simple, so beautiful. Well, this story is, as the title describes, a true quest to solve one of the most difficult problems in Mathematics which Fermat’s Last Theorem used to be. Simon Singh did this superbly. He is absolutely great at explaining from whole numbers and 1+1 to elliptical equations and modular forms. But the best was to learn about some of the greatest minds that worked so hard in the last century solving problems and doing the maths that have been the basis and tool for proving this theorem and thus, their great contribution to science: Pythagoras and his controversial Pythagorean Brotherhood, Mersenne, Euclid, Diophantus and his most remarkable “Arithmetica”, of course Pierre de Fermat, Pascal, brilliant Euler, Cantor, Sophie Germain, Theano, Hypatia, Maria Agnesi, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Cauchy, Lamè, Kummer, Wolfskehl, Gödel, Turing, Shimura, Taniyama, and Andrew Wiles. These are not the only ones, of course, but the most outstanding for me from this book. I want to make a special mention to the part where Singh talks about the work of women that were mathematicians. Even as of today, there aren’t many of us women dedicated to numbers or number theory, but we have come to a time when we can actually pursue this career, despite the struggles and obstacles that still exist in our societies. But being a mathematician a few centuries ago was completely outrageous and out of this world! Sophie Germain had to study secretly at night and keep a secret stock of candles to do so, because her dad used to confiscate them to prevent her from studying. Or Agnesi who was referred to as the “witch of Agnesi”. And the most extreme of these was Hypatia of Alexandria who suffered the most tragic and brutal death to the hands of the exulted mob led by the patriarch of Alexandria because she was considered a heretic. These stories really moved me and I’m very glad that their names are remembered and admired although they did not have a voice in their own time. Their only voice was their endless curiosity and passion for trying to understand the Universe and their brilliant work pervaded through history and remained printed in our books and forever in our memories, a greatly deserved honor to inspire all of us. And back to Fermat’s Theorem, Wiles amazing work on his childhood’s dream inspired this book and will hopefully inspire many more that see the beauty of numbers to keep working and pushing the frontiers on this science field which Singh perfectly describes as the “language of nature”."

My only gripe with this book is that the author tries to push a narrative a little too hard and tends to over-dramatize certain details. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable mathematical journey. Simon Singh has done well to make the book accessible and not overtly mathematical and confusing to read."

The story starts with Andrew Wiles who brought an end to this endless wait. But the span of the story is far far larger. Love stories, tragedies, moments of brilliances, moments of inspiration, moments of chance all intertwined in a marvellous way to solve this enigma. Did Fermat really have a foolproof proof? If he had it with the tools available at his time, then it still remains an enigma. Simon Singh brings to us this wonderful story in a brilliant way. "

I don't do mathematics and haven't studied anything beyond the bare minimum required for a Bachelor's degree, but I find something wonderful about the pursuits of people like Andrew Wiles and the number theorists who spend years of their lives working on a set of problems. Wiles's obsessive mindset and solitary quest reminded of Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season"" and I wonder if Carlson read this or another account of Wiles's eight-year project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem? (From ""Towel Season"":)When they were dating, he'd begun to try to explain his work to her in metaphors, and she'd continued the game through his career, asking him for comparisons that she'd then inhabit, embellish. Right after they were married and Edison was in graduate school, he'd work late into the night in their apartment and crawl into bed with the calculations still percolating in his head. ""What's it like?"" Leslie would ask. ""Where are you now?"" She could tell he was remote, lit. They talked in territories.""I've crossed all the open ground, and the wind has stopped now. My hope is to find a way through this next place.""""Mountains?""""Right. Okay, mountains--blank, very few markings."" He spoke carefully and with a quiet zeal. ""They're steep, hard to see.""""Is it cold?""""No, but it is strange. It's quiet."" Then he'd turn to her in bed, his eyes bright, alive. ""I'm way past the path. I don't think anyone has climbed this route before. There are no trails, handholds.""Leslie would smile and kiss him in that close proximity. ""Keep going,"" she'd say. ""Halfway up that mountain, there's a woman with a cappuccino cart and a chicken-salad sandwich--me.""Then a smile would break across his face, too, and he would see her, kiss her back, and say it: ""Right. You.""A book has yet to fulfill my odd wish to peek over the shoulder of a mathematician working on a problem like Fermat's Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. Until a science writer like Singh explained it in metaphors and broad concepts I wouldn't understand what the mathematician was doing, but wouldn't it be weirdly magical to observe!"

Come to think of it, those percentages hold true for the rest of my life. There are times when your best bet is to find a good math book. Two plus two is four.

203,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"well, the main thing i took from this book is probably that maths is a field for privileged white men. you have to be rich enough to be able to live comfortably while devoting their life to solving a centuries-old problem simply because they think proving it would be ""satisfying"". you must also be white - or at least living in the west - so that you are actually recognized for your work, otherwise your work will be spotted by someone who lives in the west who will take credit for it. and you must be male. obviously. the politics of the world of mathematics is interesting stuff folks. anyway, it's an alright book. very informative n clear (most of the time). also pretty funny. although i would recommend the 1st half of the book to pretty much anyone, it does sort of get a bit jargon-y and vague by the end. i still enjoyed it, but not at much as i did the first half. i did find the lack of dates for all the events a bit annoying. singh often jumped from event to event, without giving his readers a very good timeline of happenings. aaaanyway. i still learnt a lot from this book. and it's very engaging. if you're interested at all in the history of mathematics, i would definitely recommend. it doesn't really tell you how to solve fermat's last theorem (you'd have to read a 200 page paper to find out sorry), but it gives you a pretty good overview of how mathematicians collectively got there. while also including a couple maths puzzles and a collection of proofs in the back <3 (i love proofs)"

The narration flows like acetone. The book starts with the climax moment of a 358 year old struggle “Fermat's last theorem”. Singh's writing style paints the whole view (awestruck people, ecstatic protagonist, exuberant surroundings) in front of your eyes. Singh is successful in seizing reader's undivided attention when he recounts the moment when the seed of this curiosity was sown in 10yr. old Wile's mind. And then, starts the roller coaster ride of the great minds who faced the thunderstorms and sunshine in Mathematical history. This book is no less than a time travel machine, which takes us to the ancient Egypt where this beguiling discipline spent its babyhood . Then the journey proceeds era by era, riddle by riddle from 3000 BC to the auspicious day when Wiles finally bid adieu to his childhood dream. Before I could even realize, I was already there with the great mathematicians, feeling the euphoria of slaughtering a puzzle, the frustration of long struggles, standing against the whole world for the love of Mathematics. Reading experience is elevated 1000 folds by the introduction of small mathematical teasers in between the chapters, when a highly motivated mathematician hidden in you will jump to iron it out. Singh takes us through the history of Mathematics related to FLT chronologically depicting many interesting stories. By the time you reach the ending, you are so engrossed in this world that you can experience the pain in the predicaments faced by Andrew Wiles. You will be able to empathize with the setbacks, hopes and tussles Wiles faced when his childhood dream was about to shatter after making it almost there!Best part of the book is “The return of Wiles”, the scenes from “The Dark Knight Rises” running alongside in my mind. One real life example of the victory of the “Never say die” doctrine. Truly mentioned in Daily Mail - “story of an obsessive love affair”!A must read for every enigma lover!"

Unfortunately, so was this book and my quest continues. Nonetheless, this book is very interesting and well written, and shows you how many things that appear to be simple and almost intuitive can be incredibly complex (that's what's so beautiful about math). In situations like this, people always tend to give all the praise to people like Andrew Wiles, without realizing on how much work and discoveries made by other people his work relies on. And even though Wiles deserves all the fame and recognition he can get for his persistence and determination, it's nice to see all the other great mathematicians who greatly contributed being mentioned. Like old saying goes: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes, and if anything, by showing how complex the proof is, it leaves you wondering, did the Fermat really have the solution?If you are only slightly interested in mathematics and were just curious about this certain topic and ideas on which the proof was based on, or are looking for a good place to start, I would definitively recommend this book. But to be fair, you can get all of that by watching previously mentioned documentary and it would cost you much less time. On the other hand, if you want something more complex and mathematical, you won't get it here."

It conveys perfectly to a layman the sense of accomplishment that the mathematical community associates with cracking the proof for this theorem. In that sense, it has the effect of a self-help book even without trying to be one."
207,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299698-pawan,5,"http://iandbooks.wordpress.comIn a way this book “Fermat’s Last Theorem” is a fantasy come true. To be able to read about complex Mathematics in a story book style is something that was possible only in this book by Simon Singh. Before I picked up this book I had no idea about Fermat’s last theorem or its significance. I just read the summary on the back page and felt like picking up the book and once I started reading it, there was no stopping it, though I did skipped over complex mathematical equations part.Fermat’s last theorem states that no set of positive three integers exist such thatan + bn = cnis satisfied for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and he claimed in his writing that he had a proof of this theorem but he did not have space left on the paper on which he was writing at that time. After his death hundreds of Mathematicians across the world tried unsuccessfully for many centuries to get the generic proof but the final proof was found only in 1995. Even though the proof has been found it is based on very complex mathematical models that were not in existence during Fermat’s time. So, it is still a mystery, how Fermat had that proof that was very simple.The book traces this history of Fermat’s last theorem. It is a fascinating story of how the best minds could not figure out something that was done by Fermat such a long time ago. The significance of this theorem is not that it brings some new understanding to the world of Mathematics but lies in the simplicity of the theorem and exceedingly complex proof of it."
208,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance,5,"Absolutely fantastic.The descriptions of all the maths and discoveries in this book are nothing short of joyful, and I felt so excited to be reading all of it. The book explains and shows why math is so amazing, how it is a divine language that describes something (i.e., number properties and their relationships) that exists outside of the physical world, how mathematicians are then often more in search of a truth in the real sense of the word than in search of a practical application or an explanation, how math discoveries can be magical and fulfilling and immortal in that they are untouched by human perception. My heart literally started beating faster when I saw the published first page of the proof. The book does a great job of conveying a narrative arc and giving background when necessary, and in presenting a pretty complicated topic in an accessible but not-dumbed down way. (Although in the U.S. the title of the book was changed to “Fermat’s Enigma,"" sigh.)Also, quite charmingly, one of the major turning points in the book is a conversation at Cafe Strada in which someone exclaims, “But don’t you see? You’ve done it! All you have to do is add some gamma-zero of (M) structure and just run through your argument and it works. It gives you everything you need.”I learned that mathematicians are big weirdos, and that they like to chat each other up at tea every day. I also learned that 10^10^10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics.”Thanks for the rec Sue!"
209,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27021963-patricia-vocat,3,"The book is a quick read. There is just enough information in it for a layman to know sufficiently about the Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof to be able to boast at a coffee table discussion with friends. And that's all.While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the poof of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view that is sometimes a bit arguable and of course oversimplified. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably. Trying to condense the basic ideas of the comprehensive proof that only few top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. Still I feel that the essence should have been in the math, but the reader gets instead a inspiring story, about a man's zealous quest for an absolute truth."
210,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Simon Singh has the ability to present a story about a mathematics problem, and tell it like a detective story. He makes the subject exciting, even though the outcome is well known. Singh intersperses history with discussions about the mathematics, and makes it quite understandable. Singh starts with the roots of the famous Fermat's Last Theorem, by recounting the stories and mathematics of Pythagoras, Euclid, and Euler. Other, less well-known mathematicians are also given credit, for example Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin Cauchy, and Evariste Galois. Three hundred fifty years ago, Fermat wrote the following theorem in the margin of a mathematics book:  And, Fermat wrote that he had a marvelous proof, but no room in the margin for it. For centuries, mathematicians have attempted to prove the theorem, without success. It had been sort of a ""holy grail"" of mathematicians to prove the theorem, and many brilliant minds spent years on it. Perhaps in was unprovable, and worst of all, Kurt Godel showed that some theorems are actually undecidable--that is to say, it is impossible even to decide whether or not a theorem is true.Singh recounts a fascinating story of the gifted mathematician, Paul Wolfskehl. He was very depressed, and decided to commit suicide on a particular night, at midnight. While waiting for that time to arrive, he started to read about the failed attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. He became so engrossed in the subject, that he worked well past midnight. He found a gap in the logic of a predecessor, and was so proud of himself that he gained a new desire for life. And, in his will he established a fund of 100,000 marks to be given to the mathematician who first completes the proof of the theorem!Much of the book describes how Andrew Wiles developed a growing interest in the theorem. He worked in almost total isolation for seven years, in order not to be distracted. He occasionally published little tidbits unrelated to his real endeavor, in order to dispel suspicions about what his real work entailed.The central piece of the proof entailed proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, that linked modular forms with elliptic equations. This was a linkage between two far-flung branches of mathematics that seemed to be totally unrelated. To prove the conjecture would allow incredible advances to be made. And then, Ken Ribet showed that a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would, in effect, be a direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But many people tried and failed to develop the proof. But that is exactly what Andrew Wiles worked on for so many years.I had previously read that during Andrew Wiles' famous lecture, he just casually let the unsuspecting audience know, ""and that is a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."" Well, this book tells a somewhat different story. Most of the audience had heard rumors that the third of Wiles' lectures would be of historical significance. They came prepared with cameras, and took photographs during the lecture. So, it was a surprise, but not a total surprise.After Wiles' manuscript of the proof was sent to a publisher, six mathematicians reviewed it, and a crucial gap was found in it. Wiles worked furiously for a nightmarish year, and with the help of Richard Taylor, finally closed the gap. Today, Wiles is recognized as the one who developed the proof. But it is clear, that Wiles ""stood on the shoulders of giants""; he used--and developed--mathematical techniques that had not existed just a few decades previously.Simon Singh writes with a wonderful style. It is clear, not too jargon-heavy but contains enough mathematical ""meat"" to seem satisfying. The book is followed by ten appendixes that contain more details about some of the mathematics; they are not overly technical, and give the reader a better understanding of some of the issues. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in math. "
211,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"Before delving into the book itself, I thought I’d start things off by introducing the problem it’s concerned with, just in case you aren’t already familiar with it.So, what exactly is Fermat’s Last Theorem? Well, basically, this is it: As you can see, the conjecture is quite easy to understand, and yet, believe it or not, it was so remarkably difficult to prove that it took over 350 years to accomplish! The fact that Fermat (teasingly?) scribbled this rather infuriating note in the margin only added to the frustration felt by the scores of mathematicians who did battle with it over the centuries: “I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.”No doubt the cheeky bastard would’ve enjoyed Twitter:Okay, now that that’s been taken care of, it’s time to look at the actual book.What Kind of Book is Fermat’s Enigma?Simply put, Fermat’s Enigma is a history book. It is most definitely NOT a math book, so don’t expect to find any degree of mathematical rigor or complexity here. There are a handful of fairly simple proofs included in the appendices, but overall, the concepts under discussion are glossed over in a superficial manner, never examined in any kind of detail. If you want something that fleshes out how the proof actually works, I’m afraid you’ll have to look elsewhere. (Singh was kind enough to include quite a few “further reading suggestions” at the end of this book. While I’ve not looked into any of the titles he recommended, I assume many of those might prove more to your liking if you prefer a “math book” on the subject.)In any case, while Singh did not pursue the actual mathematics in any real sense, he did positively excel at telling the story of an utterly fascinating struggle, one which spanned hundreds of years and ensnared countless brilliant, talented minds. Readers make the acquaintance of such notable mathematicians as Pythagoras (whose work paved the way for Fermat), Leonhard Euler, Paul Wolfskehl, Sophie Germain, Daniel Bernoulli, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Evariste Galois, Yutaka Taniyama, Goro Shimura, and of course Andrew Wiles, the man, the myth, the legend who finally proved the damn thing. Overall, I was surprised and delighted by just how compelling the story actually was. For me, this book quickly became a veritable page-turner, one I was loathe to put aside. Some may argue that in order to accomplish this, he omitted too much relevant information, that he sacrificed depth for readability. Perhaps this is true to an extent, but in my opinion, while it was admittedly easy to read and follow, it still managed to include a fair amount of pertinent, interesting material. More importantly, it never got bogged down with unnecessary details or lost in minutiae, and never meandered down exasperating tangents, as many otherwise outstanding history books are wont to do. And ultimately, what made this book so very stimulating was that the manner in which the story was told really made it come alive. Singh bestowed a truly suspenseful, exciting quest upon the reader, one full of twists and turns, and even *gasp* its fair share of drama. He enthusiastically demonstrated just how action-packed and exhilarating the life of the mind can be. And for accomplishing this tremendous feat, I heartily recommend the book, warts and all.And Now, For a Few Words on the Star of the ShowAndrew Wiles is an extraordinary human being. Fascinated by Fermat’s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, he vowed to conquer that most impossible of proofs. This was at the age of ten, mind you. I seriously can’t get past that. And then, true to his word, the little rascal grew up to become an eminent mathematician, one who finally went into seclusion for seven years in order to hack away at this tremendous proof. While a not insignificant error marred the first release of said proof, he didn’t let that deter him, but persevered and managed to rectify the error, and, within a couple of years, came out with THE proof. Holy goddamn shit. To me, Wiles’ story was completely and utterly inspiring. I was frankly amazed by what the human mind can achieve; I think I will always be in awe of Wiles’ fierce determination and incredible tenacity. Mad respect. Anyway, as you can probably tell, Andrew Wiles is a personal hero of mine. He is an undeniable, ultimate badass. Wayne and Garth said it best:"

A very trite remark, too lengthy to write in the margin so it is elsewhere, and no one has ever found it or managed to prove his statement, until - - - this book is a brilliant read, you would think it would be as dry as dust, but no! It is a superb account of the proof of the last theorem from Fermat's notebook to be proven. The only thing that still niggles at me, although the mathematical proof is fabulous, it uses modern techniques not available to Fermat, so it is proven but how the hell did Fermat do it??????A brilliant book, beautifully written a tremendous historical question answered in a very modern way, fabulous, well done for readability."

215,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This is the kind of book that we non mathematical minds can easily digest and love. It gives you an epic scope of the number of minds that it takes to build new ideas. I doubt if Fermat had actually solved this theorem correctly, but this is impossible to prove. Fermat's theorem however was not impossible to prove! It was solved! Thanks to the efforts of many men (and women!) over many lifetimes and one final man who had the determination and persistence to finish the unthinkable. This book has a lot of wonderful elements, and really exemplifies a love of mathematics. Although if you want to actually understand the theorem this book may not be for you! I can honestly say reading it did not put the theorem in any more digestible light than it started out with. Perhaps it was to the authors advantage to skip the technicalities and focus on the enjoyment of the journey. I personally loved this approach, but it may not be for everyone, especially if you are actually looking to understand the theorem (a massive undertaking that is really not in my repertoire to comment on). "
216,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,3,"What a fun book this was (thanks, Trevor, for the recommendation)! There are many reasons I think I like (good) nonfiction -- a sense of direct relevance, gravitas, frequent insights into the workings of the universe (and people), but mostly for knowledge narcs -- high levels of information density served up into an intriguing package by someone else who has undertaken the heavy lifting (research, organization, thinking). So, here in Singh's work I get a solid lay understanding not only of the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem, but of much of mathematics (and the lives of mathematicians) since the seventeenth century.I've been thinking also about what attracts me to books on mathematical topics -- the works by Martin Gardner, William Poundstone, and the various other authors in the company of whose thoughts I've had pleasure to spend a week or more. What I've come away with, is that the best of them feed off surprises, those bits of counterintuitive anecdotes that leave you blurting out, ""Huh. How about that,"" and then looking madly around for someone to tell. Like a book of jokes, riddles, or puzzles that provides immediate gratification in the back of the book, Fermat's Enigma plugs at least ten conundrums (and their easy-to-understand, logical solutions) into its appendices. For example -- say you're unlucky enough to be forced into a three-way duel. If everyone gets to take turns in order of their skill such that worst shoots first, what should the worst do? Aim at the best in the hopes of getting lucky and eliminating the most dangerous gunsel? Nope, the correct answer is to pass up the turn in the hopes that your first shot will get to be expended against only one remaining combatant. That way, even if you miss, you at least had a chance to take aim at the only person able to shoot back.Pierre Fermat turns out to have been quite the prankster, often tweaking professional mathematicians and academics by mailing them problems they knew full well he had already solved. For those who don't keep this type of trivia at the forefront of their brains, Fermat's the French recluse (and hanging circuit jurist) who once famously scribbled in a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica that x^n + y^n ≠ z^n for any number n greater than 2, a propostion for which he had ""a truly marvelous demonstration… which this margin is too narrow to contain."" This gets to be Fermat's Last Theorem, simply because it ends up being the last of his conundrums to be proven (not necessarily the last one he wrote). Just think, were it not for the scrupulous care taken by Fermat's son to go through and publish all of Fermat, Sr.'s writings, the world would not have been tantalized by this particular gem for 
over 350 YEARS
.Andrew Wiles published the first (and only?) proof in 1994, and Enigma does a tremendous job of walking the reader through not only the stunning depth of his intellectual achievement, but its significance as well. Suffice it to say that I was happy here to read that Taniyama-Shimura get their well-earned due and that modular and elliptical equations can finally be understood to be mathematically analogous (whether or not I have any idea what modular equations actually are). Still, all of this leads to what I think is an even more tantalizing problem. We now know that all of Fermat's conjectures ultimately proved to be solvable and that Fermat's own notes would seem to indicate that he had indeed apparently found ways to solve each of them. But there is no doubt that Fermat's solution could not have relied on the up-to-the-minute maths Wiles employs over 200 pages. So if it was really the limitations of the margin and not of Fermat that inhibited publication… what was Fermat's proof?"
217,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Strap in, guys. I’m going to walk you through the history of how Fermat’s Last Theorum was proved, all in one little (okay, big) review. And I can do this because of this awesome, semi-accessible, frequently tangent-taking, but mostly, this deeply fascinating book.----------STEP ONE: THE THEORUM----------For the unenlightened, Fermat’s Last Theorum is this: you probably know the Pythagorean theorum, a² + b² = c², which explains that if you square the shorter two sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, you get the value of third side squared. This is easily proved (that is, demonstrated to be completely, utterly, logically true via a mathematical proof, using axioms known to be true, which is just like a logic proof if you’ve done philosophy. Or a geometry proof, if you went to 9th grade). Take any triangle, and this will be true. There are infinite solutions to this equation—literally infinite values of A, B, and C which will render this solution true. However, Fermat discovered that the formula an + bn = cn where n > 2 has NO whole number solutions. (Go ahead, give it a whirl. I’ll wait).Then he challenged the mathematical community to create a mathematical proof demonstrating this must be true. While tantalizing them with the knowledge he’d already created a proof for this with a scribbled note in the margin of his notebook: “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.” Asshole. So sparked centuries of people trying to write this proof, to no avail. Until Professor Andrew Wiles (who has the most apropos name ever—he has wiles indeed) of Cambridge, in 1993.***For clarity, this is Fermat’s Equation (which I’ll refer to as FE): an + bn = cn where n > 2And THIS is Fermat’s Last Theorum (which I’ll refer to as FLT): “There are no solutions to Fermat’s Equation”***----------TANGENT: GODEL----------At this point, it’s been assumed that math is logically perfect—that if you correctly build a proof using axioms (like m + n = n + m), it must be true (and if it’s proven to be true, nothing can prove it to be false). This is known as “axiomatic set theory.” Along came Godel (who is analyzed to death by my beloved, Doug Hofstadter- see here and here). His ideas are as follows: 1. If axiomatic set theory is consistent, then there have to be theorems that can’t be proved or disproved. Why? Because of paradoxes. Godel translated the following statement into mathematical notation: “This statement has no proof.” If that’s false, then you COULD create a proof for that statement—however, that would make the statement false, so how could you have a proof for that? So it has to be true. But if it’s true, it can’t be proved because that’s what it literally says. It’s a mathematical statement that is true, but could never be proved to be true (an “undecidable statement”). 2. There’s no way to prove that axiomatic set theory is consistent; in a way, it’s one of those “undecidable statement” that’s true but can’t be proved to be true. Interestingly, this parallels the physicist Heisenberg’s discovery of the uncertainty principle, but we won’t get into that. Now, there aren’t very many of those undecidable statements. Godel couldn’t really point to any other undecidable statements besides the one above, so people assumed they were found only in the most extreme math and would probably never even be encountered. Welp. A young student named Paul Cohen at Stanford discovered a way to test whether a question is undecidable, and in doing so, discovered several more.Which sparked some fear in mathematicians. What if Fermat’s Last Theorum was undecidable?! What if they were wasting their time trying to prove the unprovable?Interestingly, if it were an undecidable statement, it couldn’t be proved—yet it would have to be true. The theorum says “there are no whole numbers to the equation an + bn = cn where n > 2.” If this were false, then it would be possible to prove this by offering a solution to this—by finding a whole number N that’s greater than 2 that allows the equation to be solved. Which would make it a decidable statement, which is a contradiction. So it can’t be false and also be an undecidable statement. In other words, Fermat’s Last Theorum might be totally true but there might be no way to prove it. ----------STEP TWO: TANIYAMA-SHIMURA CONJECTURE----------Modular forms are a mathematical tool, sort of like impossible forms or shapes, that reveal a lot about how numbers are related. The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (TSC), created by two Japanese mathematicians (one of whom tragically and abruptly killed himself quite young) says every modular form is related to a specific elliptic equation (elliptic equations were Andrew Wiles’s main area of study; they’re a type of equation, not super important that you understand them). The fact that these were unified meant there’s a kind of Rosetta stone that’s been discovered: “Simple intuitions in the modular world translate into deep truths in the elliptic world, and vice versa. Very profound problems in the elliptic world can get solved sometimes by translating them using this Rosetta stone into the modular world, and discovering that we have the insights and tools in the modular world to treat the translated problem. Back in the elliptic world we would have been at a loss.”Beyond that awesomeness, the TSC suggests something even more interesting: that possibly all of mathematics, all the different worlds of mathematics, might have parallels in other worlds, as with the elliptic world and the modular world. All of mathematics might be unified—arguably the absolute ultimate goal of abstract mathematics, because this would give us the most complete picture, and the biggest arsenal of tools to solve mathematical problems. ----------STEP THREE: RIBET’S THEORUM----------This is all important for FLT because of something called Ribet’s Theorum (Ribet was a colleague of Wiles). Ribet’s Theorum goes like this: the imagined solution to FE can be translated into an elliptic equation. And that elliptic equation doesn’t seem to have a modular world equivalent. But the TSC claims that every elliptic equation must be related to a modular form. So if you can PROVE that the elliptic form of the solution to FE has no modular form (which we can! The proof was done in 1986), the following is true: if the TSC is true (i.e. all elliptic equations have modular forms), and the elliptic form of the imagined solution to FE has no modular form, then the imagined solution cannot exist, proving FLT. So now, all we have to do is prove that the TSC is true, and FLT is automatically proven to be true. And this—THIS—is what Andrew Wiles focused on. Proving the TSC (Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture).----------STEP FOUR: PROVING THE THEORUM----------Wiles finally succeeded when he applied a new method called the Kolyvagin-Flach method, which groups elliptic equations into families and then proves that an elliptic equation in that family has a modular form; if that elliptic equation has a modular form, then all other elliptic equations in that family also has a modular form. However, the Kolyvagin-Flach method has to be adapted for each family of elliptic equations. Wiles successfully adapted the method for all families of elliptic equations, thereby proving that all elliptic equations have modular forms (which, as a reminder, is basis of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, and proving the TSC proves FLT). Two months before I was born, in 1993, he proved FLT in a series of 3 lectures. Kinda. Actually, there was a minor flaw in his proof (essentially, he might have failed to properly adapt the Kolyvagin-Flach method for some of the families of equations) but it doesn’t really matter because a year later, Wiles published a work-around to that flaw, so he proved FLT once and for all. ----------CONCLUSION----------All I can think about is: maybe if math looked like this, if THIS had been our material in high school—maybe then I wouldn’t have disliked it. Maybe other people wouldn’t, either. What a shoddy job we do teaching our children the wonder of learning."
218,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This book is as interesting as a detective story while being about quite advanced mathematics - as such it is quite a book showing the remarkable skill of its writer to explain complex ideas in ways that are always readable and enjoyable.A mathematician finds a simple proof to what seems like a deceptively simple problem of mathematics - that pythagoras's theorem only works if the terms are squared, and not if they are any other power up to infinity. Sounds dull. Except that the mathematician jots down that he has found this proof, but not what the proof is. And for hundredsd of years the greatest minds in mathematics have tried to find this simple proof and been beaten by the problem time and again.This really is a delightful book and one that gives an insight into how mathematicians think about the world. The proof of Pythagoras's theorem given in this book is so simple that the beauty of mathematical proof is made plain to everyone. Just a little knowledge of algebra is needed for this part of the book - the rest requires no maths at all."

220,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,3,"I never watched any documentaries before going to college (and this was about a century and a half ago.. I am getting old -_-. But yeah, 2009 to be precise). I was always interested in NatGeo and History Channel - but they never showed the real deal on television. The documentaries would be mostly half assed, and at worst, total crap. That's also how Indian television landscape can be broadly categorized too, give or take a few exceptions ofcourse. And so I grew up loving the sciences based on what was taught in school curriculum, and elsewhere what I read on the slow 64-bit internet connection.And then college happened. Parents got me my own laptop - and the college intranet had a ton of stuff that other students shared. That place and that time - was where my love for documentaries was born. I had never been so fascinated with anything before. And the first two that I watched - in a long line of them - were Einstein's Biggest Blunder and BBC's Fermat's Last Theorem. The memory of that sunday afternoon is still pretty fresh. Back then, I only had a casual interest in astronomy and cosmology, and Einstein's theories were still something exotic. And so I basically understood jackshit from the first documentary. Even more intrigued than before, I started the second one. Fermat's Last Theorem was much more relatable - I had known the theorem, and understood the concept too. Years later when I joined goodreads, I found out that there was a book too. Keeping in with the tradition of firsts, it became the first book on my TBR pile too. Where it stayed until a few days ago - and I finally marked it as read last night. To be honest, this isn't the greatest book ever. It isnt even Simon Singh's best, who delivered the goods the much better in Big Bang.

What held me back is what will probably put a lot of other potential readers off trying it - the boring old ""I'm no good at maths"" argument. Although my maths education is probably little above average (a good O Level and a terrible A Level, after which I rallied somewhat to obtain a reasonable HNC maths module) it's //very// many years out of use and it's all I can do to add two numbers up in my head. Given that this book is about a problem that flummoxed the best mathematical minds in the world for over 350 years you'd be forgiven for putting this back on the shelf and choosing something a little simpler. Well, don't even try that... YOU DON'T NEED ANY MATHS TO READ THIS! What Singh has done here is to present a hugely complex subject in a hugely entertaining way. The search for the answer to Fermat's riddle reads like a detective story and not a matehematical treatise and it includes a truly absorbing potted history of the development of maths over the years and, from Pythagoras to Fermat to Godel to Wiles, each part has a fascinating human side to it. Budding mathematicians needn't feel left out as the mechanics of the maths is also included, but it's treated in a gentle way: each step of the problem (and it's solution) is described in a simplified (but certainly not dumbed down) manner and some simple exercises are included in several short appendices. However, take heart! There are several places where elements of the maths are obviously too complex for us mortals and Singh is not afraid to say soo and then gloss over them completely. That may be a disappointment to some, but it's not at all unreasonable in my opinion. All in all, the net result is a book that is sensitive to its readers, intelligent, interesting and important. It's literally unputdownable and it had the added bonus of tricking me into thinking that I'm a little cleverer than I really am. I notice there's an inevitable Wills and Kate bio on the bestseller list at the moment. Put your hard earned cash into Andrew Morton's pockets or read something that will make you feel like a genius.

223,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A fantastically entertaining and educational book about the quest to solve the oldest math problem: Fermat's Last Theorem. The intrigue, mystery, and drama surrounding the famous theorem without a proof (but that Fermat had said he had a proof for, just not enough space to write it in the margins) is exciting enough. All the math greats who have attempted to solve it but come up a little short, or a lot short.But it's much more than that, since the final proof of Fermat's Theorem involves so many other math concepts. This book starts and ends with Fermat, but in the middle it is more like a grand tour of all the mathematical developments that make the proof even possible. It's interesting to read about all the different dead ends and other productive findings (that had tangentially made it a little more possible to solve Fermat, but whose main contribution was in some other area). Also, reading about Galois's amazing life always makes me giddy. I mean, I've read about him before, but his story is just so crazy--math genius turned revolutionary thrown in jail involved in affair ends in duel, scribbles out his last thoughts the night before he dies... amazing.But don't expect to understand how the proof actually works by the end. The proof itself is over 100 pages, so there is no way a normal non-math genius can understand it. But you will get a general idea of the approach/trajectory/style of the final beast. Also, some of the math concepts leading up to it are quite easily comprehensible. I wouldn't recommend this book to a math whiz... it's more of a fun read for the layperson.It would ultimately be more satisfying if the proof were a short elegant thing that didn't involve latest groundbreaking discoveries in math. But maybe the bright side is that we can still wonder about Fermat's original (alleged) proof that was never written down. It had to be different from Andrew Wile's proof; does it exist? Or was Fermat bluffing? Or did he make an error in his proof?"

It chronicles the life and works of not just Fermat, but most of the mathematicians having even a tiny bit to do with the conjecture/theorem. Curious and strange revelations into the lives of many of the princes and princesses of mathematics are presented. It presents the case of lives, pursuits and the times that they lived in. The problems that they face (mathematical and others), how these affect the progress/decline of the field. Simon Singh writes brilliantly mixing accounts of math behind the problem along with the lives of these mathematicians. We get to see accounts of love, suicides, suicide averted by fixating on a proof, duels and revolutionaries. For me it was shocking to know, that it was not just the kings and religious fellows destroying these geniuses and their sanctuaries, but Pythagoras also committed a grave mistake once, sentencing Hippasus to death for arguing that sqrt(2) cannot be expressed as a fraction!A must read for those interested in history behind the problem."

Having said that, all the mathematics in the book can be understood with a background in high school mathematics. This book is a great read simply because of the intellectual achievement that it talks about. Strongly recommended if you're remotely interested in mathematics."
227,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"I have a special love for words. I think I always have. They’re fascinating. The words in this book were used for telling a story about numbers, which made me realize I also love numbers so much, I just didn’t know. Math had always been the “easy subject” at school for me, the one which did not require long hours of study, because it was so logical, the one you could check before turning in an exam and know you had the right answers precisely because it matched so perfectly. “Proof is what lies at the heart of maths.”, indeed, so simple, so beautiful. Well, this story is, as the title describes, a true quest to solve one of the most difficult problems in Mathematics which Fermat’s Last Theorem used to be. Simon Singh did this superbly. He is absolutely great at explaining from whole numbers and 1+1 to elliptical equations and modular forms. But the best was to learn about some of the greatest minds that worked so hard in the last century solving problems and doing the maths that have been the basis and tool for proving this theorem and thus, their great contribution to science: Pythagoras and his controversial Pythagorean Brotherhood, Mersenne, Euclid, Diophantus and his most remarkable “Arithmetica”, of course Pierre de Fermat, Pascal, brilliant Euler, Cantor, Sophie Germain, Theano, Hypatia, Maria Agnesi, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Cauchy, Lamè, Kummer, Wolfskehl, Gödel, Turing, Shimura, Taniyama, and Andrew Wiles. These are not the only ones, of course, but the most outstanding for me from this book. I want to make a special mention to the part where Singh talks about the work of women that were mathematicians. Even as of today, there aren’t many of us women dedicated to numbers or number theory, but we have come to a time when we can actually pursue this career, despite the struggles and obstacles that still exist in our societies. But being a mathematician a few centuries ago was completely outrageous and out of this world! Sophie Germain had to study secretly at night and keep a secret stock of candles to do so, because her dad used to confiscate them to prevent her from studying. Or Agnesi who was referred to as the “witch of Agnesi”. And the most extreme of these was Hypatia of Alexandria who suffered the most tragic and brutal death to the hands of the exulted mob led by the patriarch of Alexandria because she was considered a heretic. These stories really moved me and I’m very glad that their names are remembered and admired although they did not have a voice in their own time. Their only voice was their endless curiosity and passion for trying to understand the Universe and their brilliant work pervaded through history and remained printed in our books and forever in our memories, a greatly deserved honor to inspire all of us. And back to Fermat’s Theorem, Wiles amazing work on his childhood’s dream inspired this book and will hopefully inspire many more that see the beauty of numbers to keep working and pushing the frontiers on this science field which Singh perfectly describes as the “language of nature”."

My only gripe with this book is that the author tries to push a narrative a little too hard and tends to over-dramatize certain details. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable mathematical journey. Simon Singh has done well to make the book accessible and not overtly mathematical and confusing to read."
229,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49715043-a-m-saffat-ee-huq,5,"One mathematical theorem, that is so simple to understand, yet the proof of which eluded mathematicians for more than 3 centuries. The story starts with Andrew Wiles who brought an end to this endless wait. But the span of the story is far far larger. Love stories, tragedies, moments of brilliances, moments of inspiration, moments of chance all intertwined in a marvellous way to solve this enigma. Did Fermat really have a foolproof proof? If he had it with the tools available at his time, then it still remains an enigma. Simon Singh brings to us this wonderful story in a brilliant way. "
230,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"Reading this book I caught a glimpse of the rarefied atmosphere of mathematicians and their processes of discovery. I don't do mathematics and haven't studied anything beyond the bare minimum required for a Bachelor's degree, but I find something wonderful about the pursuits of people like Andrew Wiles and the number theorists who spend years of their lives working on a set of problems. Wiles's obsessive mindset and solitary quest reminded of Ron Carlson's short story ""Towel Season"" and I wonder if Carlson read this or another account of Wiles's eight-year project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem? (From ""Towel Season"":)When they were dating, he'd begun to try to explain his work to her in metaphors, and she'd continued the game through his career, asking him for comparisons that she'd then inhabit, embellish. Right after they were married and Edison was in graduate school, he'd work late into the night in their apartment and crawl into bed with the calculations still percolating in his head. ""What's it like?"" Leslie would ask. ""Where are you now?"" She could tell he was remote, lit. They talked in territories.""I've crossed all the open ground, and the wind has stopped now. My hope is to find a way through this next place.""""Mountains?""""Right. Okay, mountains--blank, very few markings."" He spoke carefully and with a quiet zeal. ""They're steep, hard to see.""""Is it cold?""""No, but it is strange. It's quiet."" Then he'd turn to her in bed, his eyes bright, alive. ""I'm way past the path. I don't think anyone has climbed this route before. There are no trails, handholds.""Leslie would smile and kiss him in that close proximity. ""Keep going,"" she'd say. ""Halfway up that mountain, there's a woman with a cappuccino cart and a chicken-salad sandwich--me.""Then a smile would break across his face, too, and he would see her, kiss her back, and say it: ""Right. You.""A book has yet to fulfill my odd wish to peek over the shoulder of a mathematician working on a problem like Fermat's Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. Until a science writer like Singh explained it in metaphors and broad concepts I wouldn't understand what the mathematician was doing, but wouldn't it be weirdly magical to observe!"

I think that what I liked the most about this book is that I was actually able to understand a good sixty percent of it. With the other forty percent, I proceeded on faith. Come to think of it, those percentages hold true for the rest of my life. There are times when your best bet is to find a good math book. Two plus two is four.

234,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10375644-akanksha,5,"Most interesting non-fiction book I have ever read.Simon Singh's style of weaving a scientific concept into a beautiful story leaves no occasion for the fictional characters and plots. The narration flows like acetone. The book starts with the climax moment of a 358 year old struggle “Fermat's last theorem”. Singh's writing style paints the whole view (awestruck people, ecstatic protagonist, exuberant surroundings) in front of your eyes. Singh is successful in seizing reader's undivided attention when he recounts the moment when the seed of this curiosity was sown in 10yr. old Wile's mind. And then, starts the roller coaster ride of the great minds who faced the thunderstorms and sunshine in Mathematical history. This book is no less than a time travel machine, which takes us to the ancient Egypt where this beguiling discipline spent its babyhood . Then the journey proceeds era by era, riddle by riddle from 3000 BC to the auspicious day when Wiles finally bid adieu to his childhood dream. Before I could even realize, I was already there with the great mathematicians, feeling the euphoria of slaughtering a puzzle, the frustration of long struggles, standing against the whole world for the love of Mathematics. Reading experience is elevated 1000 folds by the introduction of small mathematical teasers in between the chapters, when a highly motivated mathematician hidden in you will jump to iron it out. Singh takes us through the history of Mathematics related to FLT chronologically depicting many interesting stories. By the time you reach the ending, you are so engrossed in this world that you can experience the pain in the predicaments faced by Andrew Wiles. You will be able to empathize with the setbacks, hopes and tussles Wiles faced when his childhood dream was about to shatter after making it almost there!Best part of the book is “The return of Wiles”, the scenes from “The Dark Knight Rises” running alongside in my mind. One real life example of the victory of the “Never say die” doctrine. Truly mentioned in Daily Mail - “story of an obsessive love affair”!A must read for every enigma lover!"

Unfortunately, so was this book and my quest continues. Nonetheless, this book is very interesting and well written, and shows you how many things that appear to be simple and almost intuitive can be incredibly complex (that's what's so beautiful about math). In situations like this, people always tend to give all the praise to people like Andrew Wiles, without realizing on how much work and discoveries made by other people his work relies on. And even though Wiles deserves all the fame and recognition he can get for his persistence and determination, it's nice to see all the other great mathematicians who greatly contributed being mentioned. Like old saying goes: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes, and if anything, by showing how complex the proof is, it leaves you wondering, did the Fermat really have the solution?If you are only slightly interested in mathematics and were just curious about this certain topic and ideas on which the proof was based on, or are looking for a good place to start, I would definitively recommend this book. But to be fair, you can get all of that by watching previously mentioned documentary and it would cost you much less time. On the other hand, if you want something more complex and mathematical, you won't get it here."

It conveys perfectly to a layman the sense of accomplishment that the mathematical community associates with cracking the proof for this theorem. In that sense, it has the effect of a self-help book even without trying to be one."
237,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299698-pawan,5,"http://iandbooks.wordpress.comIn a way this book “Fermat’s Last Theorem” is a fantasy come true. To be able to read about complex Mathematics in a story book style is something that was possible only in this book by Simon Singh. Before I picked up this book I had no idea about Fermat’s last theorem or its significance. I just read the summary on the back page and felt like picking up the book and once I started reading it, there was no stopping it, though I did skipped over complex mathematical equations part.Fermat’s last theorem states that no set of positive three integers exist such thatan + bn = cnis satisfied for any integer value of n greater than two. This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and he claimed in his writing that he had a proof of this theorem but he did not have space left on the paper on which he was writing at that time. After his death hundreds of Mathematicians across the world tried unsuccessfully for many centuries to get the generic proof but the final proof was found only in 1995. Even though the proof has been found it is based on very complex mathematical models that were not in existence during Fermat’s time. So, it is still a mystery, how Fermat had that proof that was very simple.The book traces this history of Fermat’s last theorem. It is a fascinating story of how the best minds could not figure out something that was done by Fermat such a long time ago. The significance of this theorem is not that it brings some new understanding to the world of Mathematics but lies in the simplicity of the theorem and exceedingly complex proof of it."
238,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602423-constance,5,"Absolutely fantastic.The descriptions of all the maths and discoveries in this book are nothing short of joyful, and I felt so excited to be reading all of it. The book explains and shows why math is so amazing, how it is a divine language that describes something (i.e., number properties and their relationships) that exists outside of the physical world, how mathematicians are then often more in search of a truth in the real sense of the word than in search of a practical application or an explanation, how math discoveries can be magical and fulfilling and immortal in that they are untouched by human perception. My heart literally started beating faster when I saw the published first page of the proof. The book does a great job of conveying a narrative arc and giving background when necessary, and in presenting a pretty complicated topic in an accessible but not-dumbed down way. (Although in the U.S. the title of the book was changed to “Fermat’s Enigma,"" sigh.)Also, quite charmingly, one of the major turning points in the book is a conversation at Cafe Strada in which someone exclaims, “But don’t you see? You’ve done it! All you have to do is add some gamma-zero of (M) structure and just run through your argument and it works. It gives you everything you need.”I learned that mathematicians are big weirdos, and that they like to chat each other up at tea every day. I also learned that 10^10^10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics.”Thanks for the rec Sue!"

There is just enough information in it for a layman to know sufficiently about the Fermat's Last Theorem and its proof to be able to boast at a coffee table discussion with friends. And that's all.While a good portion of the story covers a wide span in history, much of the story is a limited biography of Andrew Wiles, the mathematician responsible for the poof of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, as with any retelling of historical events, Singh offers a subjective view that is sometimes a bit arguable and of course oversimplified. Most of the math was kept in the abstract, understandably. Trying to condense the basic ideas of the comprehensive proof that only few top mathematicians in the world can understand into a chapter or two comprehensible to the average reader is an impossible task. Still I feel that the essence should have been in the math, but the reader gets instead a inspiring story, about a man's zealous quest for an absolute truth."

The book describes the origin of the theorem, and the consequent journey towards the proof. The proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians! However, this apparently innocuous theorem stimulated the development of number theory in mathematics. And it all started with Fermat's famous margin note ""I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.""Simon Singh has described it all beautifully, in a simple but attractive, exemplifying every new concept. I would not recommended this book to anyone who hasn't at least done maths till high school, simply because even though the book is written in simplified terms, only someone who loves maths would truly enjoy the book. The author's enthusiasm is infectious, and makes this book on maths feel like a suspense novel! "

The book also included the actual proofs in the appendix (for the simple ones) and at least bothered to name-drop technical terms (so I could research them) before going on to simplify them for the casual reader.During certain parts, it felt like things were being over-simplified and getting repetitive, but those are minor grievances I'm willing to overlook.The book's inspiring and _tons_ of fun if you're even a little interested in Math! :D"

Singh explains the ideas behind the eventual solution in a clear manner. A lot of the actual maths baffled me a bit, but they're not the main point of this book.Rather, it shows the single minded obsession that someone can have as they try and solve something that possibly only a few others could.The book is well written and has an interesting story behind it, with tension rising in the last few chapters.

It tells the full “story of a riddle that confounded the world's greatest minds for 358 years” — until mathematician Andrew Wiles found a proof in 1993 to a problem formulated centuries earlier by the infamous riddler Pierre de Fermat. Wiles followed his childhood dream and after establishing himself in the academia he worked for years in total secrecy to find a solution to a problem that was by many already considered unbreakable. Singh did a superb job to introduce readers to the long history of Fermat's theorem and dropped enough breadcrumbs for anyone with basic understanding of high school math to follow the developing mystery from its inception to its final stages, establishing Wiles as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century. Just don't be discouraged by the seemingly difficult topic.

This is his second book I have read after the equally amazing ""The Code Book"", and what thrilled me was the dramatic build-up of his narrative structure that ends up with a remarkable punch line, a proof no less dramatic than a finale to an epic. Fermat's last theorem that has baffled mathematicians from last 300 years was finally solved by Andrew Wiles in the 90s, but the proof, which creatively uses the best of traditional and twentieth century mathematical advances, is difficult to understand for the general reader. Singh tackles the problem by clearly explaining basics to keep the reader interested and invests pages over pages in curious sketches of mathematicians who spent their lives around the proof. Their mistakes, their tragedies, their triumphs all merge into a seamless narrative that ultimately rewards and inspires. The book has been described as a mathematical detective story, and one couldn't disagree."

Of course, when the Fermat theorem was finally proven, it was a big deal for our teacher, who always suspected Fermat had bluffed and had never completed the demonstration. When we asked him how it was proven, we were told our level was too poor to understand (That’s the beauty of the French school system: teachers are very honest.).I read Simon Singh’s book 17 years later and I am glad to have at last an approximate idea of the theorem’s demonstration. I especially liked the chronological approach to the problem-solving steps, and I wish I had been told more about Math’s history at school. I thought Singh’s approach was very pedagogical."

256,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1752430-drew,5,"I remember sitting in an office with a friend and downloading his proof when it was published. I had a small background in abstract algebra and I was able to get through a few pages, but then became utterly lost. I was still enthralled and flipped through it like it was a gift for my birthday! Based on recommendations from two people, I jumped into Simon Singh’s book on Fermat’s Last Theorem.Singh is a fantastic writer. His writing is lucid and fluid: never too many words, but also never too few. I enjoyed the mathematical background (and enjoyed working through the appendices), historical tidbits, how mathematicians work and the actual story of Wiles’s approach to the proof. It was a detective story with a touch of romance and history to it. It was exciting as each piece of the puzzle came together. I knew the ending and I still couldn’t wait to work through each page!I enjoyed the history that Singh provided, from the classical Greek mathematic Pythagorus, up through the centuries to Fermat and then to the present. This was a lovely romp through my two true academic loves: mathematics and classical studies. I was happy that he incorporated the story of female mathematicians into his narrative, something I didn’t know and that rarely pops up in general discussion of great mathematicians. Also, I enjoyed the chapter devoted to Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura, and their conjecture that sought to equate modular forms with elliptic equations. This conjecture was the ultimate lever that Wiles used to prove Fermat’s theorem.Singh also builds a strong case for pure research, even into seemingly unimportant topics. Fermat’s theorem was a cool idea, but on its own, it really didn’t seem that crucial. Yet the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, and the follow on work by Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet, tied a solution to something that would unite disparate parts of very important contemporary mathematics. Fermat provided the motivation, originally by accident, to improving modern mathematics. Wiles said “the definition of a good mathematical problem is the mathematics it generates rather than the problem itself” (p. 163).As for Wiles, he did amazing work and fulfilled his childhood dream. The book ends with a quote from him that I take to heart: “I had this very rare privilege of being able to pursue in my adult life what had been my childhood dream. I know it’s a rare privilege, but if you can tackle something in adult life that means that much to you then it’s more rewarding than anything imaginable” (p. 285).My problem with Wiles is that his success was due to other people doing what he refused to do. I think Singh implies it occasionally. Wiles succeeded because he was able to look at the work and ideas that other mathematics published. Taniyama, Shimura, Frey, Ribet and others had interesting insights directly or indirectly related to Fermat’s Last Theorem. They could have kept those ideas secret, like Wiles did. But, that would have slowed, or possibly stopped him in his tracks. He kept his task secret for seven years, even going so far as to publish unrelated work to throw people ‘off the scent.’ I know this was his lifelong dream and he wanted to solve it on his own. But, mathematical progress seems fastest when ideas are put out into the community and others can add their points of view. This isn’t meant diminish Wiles’s intellect or accomplishment, but it makes me wonder if Fermat’s theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture could have been proved sooner. Most mathematicians, including Wiles, seemingly went into mathematics due to the beauty of the system, rather than for money or glory.I highly recommend this book to everyone, from people with no interest in math up to PhD’s at the top of the field.

257,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27525841-lyle-regenwetter,4,"Fermat's Enigma is the first nonfiction book I have read in a while, and it exceeded my initially non-optimistic expectations in several ways. This book discusses Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous mathematical problems ever known to man. x^2+y^2=z^2 is a very familiar problem, appears frequently in mathematics, including in the Pythagorean Theorem for the relationship of Side Lengths of Right triangles. x^3+y^3=z^3 is a very similar problem, except for the fact that there are no real solutions. Furthermore, the proof remained a mystery to mathematicians for decades. How could such a deceptively simple problem be so difficult to solve? Contrary to my initial expectations, Fermat's Enigma focused less on the mathematics and more on the story of the quest of mathematicians to find the proof. The Author, Singh, did a fabulous job of making this boring story of a handful of lonely mathematicians into a story that actually interested me. As I said, my expectations were low going into this book. I was expecting a rather boring read, just something to read until I could find something more interesting, in fact. Although far from being action-packed, Fermat's Enigma kept me entertained in my free time for a few days. For those intimidated by mathematics, especially this unsolvably difficult problem, not to worry: Singh made this book very easy to comprehend. I had no trouble understanding the mathematical details incorporated into the plot, and I am sure the majority of readers could do the same. Before reading this book, in fact, I had already watched a documentary outlining he more technical mathematical aspects of the proof, which was in fact, related to another unsolved mathematical problem. The less technical nature of the book suited my interests nicely, because I got an interesting story out of this book, instead of a repetition of material that I am already familiar with. Consequently, I give this book 4 stars because, although not as exciting as I would have preferred, this book exceeded expectations and gave me a good read that I could think about in my spare time. In my opinion, this book gave a perfect amount of mathematical detail so that the average reader would be able to comprehend, but not see right through the mathematics. In addition, the average reader would most definitely take away some mathematical knowledge that they could apply to some things, or at least be able to discuss with or entertain a friend. This book was written in a similar style to The Code Book, also by Simon Singh. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a nonfiction book and put in a little bit of brainpower while reading. This is a great opportunity to experience the challenges and the research of the modern-day mathematician."

The theorem itself is very simple: No three positive integers satisfy the equation below when n is greater than 2.X^n + Y^n = Z^n This equation is similar to Pythagorean theorem (in fact, the Pythagorean theorem is the specific case of Fermat's last theorem in which n is equal 2). We know from our middle school math class that solutions exist in that case; in fact, sides of a right angle triangle can be expressed by this equation when n is equal to 2. And yet, when n=3 or above no integer solution exists. Fermat, himself, did not provide proof for his theorem, simply stating that he had no space to write down the solution of this problem. Whether he indeed proved his theorem or not is still debatable, but as far as we know, it took mathematicians all over the world for over three hundred years to prove his theorem. Rumor has it that the actual proof is over a hundred pages!The book is full of examples of how countless mathematicians ""wasted"" their entire lives to find the solution to this problem. One of the most heartbreaking stories is definitely the story of a Japanese mathematician Taniyama who committed suicide leaving a suicide note stating how tired he was and that he lost confidence in his future. Although largely criticized for his work during his lifetime, his conjecture has been a vital part in solving the Fermat's Last Theorem. It was heartbreaking but invigorating at times to learn about the lives of these mathematicians and how dedicated and obsessive they were about doing mathematics. The book also mentions the death of Archimedes who was so engrossed in his mathematical study that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman Soldier during the War and was speared to death. Although not many people would like the idea of being obsessed with something so deeply that it results in their own death, I wish I had that obsession - something that I could die for. They say ""Find what you love and let it kill you"". To say that it is the most ideal death may not be an exaggeration after reading this book :POverall, this book is highly recommended for scientists or mathematicians or simply anyone who needs some inspiration to get involved in academia."

I never could have imagined that one could write nearly 300 pages on a mathematical equation and make it genuinely exciting and fun to read! It really is the skill of the author to have built such a narrative around a topic that most people would overlook as something dull and uninteresting.Mathematics and mathematicians are both reputed to be dry and even intimidating, but this book does a brilliant job of changing that image. I had always enjoyed mathematics in school but had never ventured into the lives of the people who were responsible for the theorems and postulates that I would mindlessly apply. I really thank Simon for adding colour to their lives. In my head, most of them were indistinguishable from one another, and somehow, I would always assume them to be socially awkward, brooding people. Thank you for turning this silly stereotype of mine on its head. I can finally appreciate what Pythagoras did in his time (IMO his secret school called the Semicircle of Pythagoras, is the coolest cult/group name ever!), how tragically his life ended due to the political scenario during that time, I can admire Euclid's sass when he expelled a student when the student asked him the ""practical application"" of the education (but not before asking his slave to give the student a coin to send him off), I can think over the tragic life of Galois, who died, at the age of 20, shrouded in mystery of what he could have been, and most importantly I can think over the women mathematicians, who braved social discrimination and prejudice to still contribute to Fermat's problem and mathematics in general.While the story ends at the eventual discovery of the proof by Andrew Wiles, it meanders effortlessly through centuries and builds a narrative that enables one to understand what achievements took place before Fermat's time, how Fermat's eccentricities and his ever so popular Last Theorem was an annoyance to all, and finally what developments over the last few centuries enabled Wiley to claim his stake upon the problem. Alongside this, the author adds tidbits in the Appendix to keep it fun throughout.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is positively wonderful."

So, when I picked this one up I thought, ""Well, it's probably more of the same, but it's popular enough I should really add it to my repertoire."" Way wrong thought. Not only does this book contain even more charming mathematical anecdotes than I'd ever read before, but it also contains better written versions of the stories I'd heard of. For example, I knew about Sophie Germain, but I didn't know she'd saved Gauss' life. I knew all about the burning of Alexandria, but I didn't know it was Mark Antony who attempted to rebuild the great library. I knew Galois died young in a duel, but I never knew the full story.I read The Code Book in high school, and I remember it being good, but in a recreational way. It piqued my interest but I didn't really shelf it with ""high literature"" like I did with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid or Music of the Spheres: The Material Universe From Atom to Quaser, Simply Explained. It was enough for me, a young geeky teenager, to have a little fun playing with codes, then move on to another book. I am very happy that I returned to Singh, and I can confidently say this is the better of the two I've read. Mathematicians sure are a romantic lot."
261,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27336185-kenny,3," I'm not a maths person. I pretty much hated it at school, and pulled myself through somehow. So I was reading this as I was much more interested in the story of solving a problem that confounded the finest minds in maths for 300 years. It's based on the comment in the margins of a text from 17th century maths-genius/possibly most frustrating man in history Pierre de Fermat. A concept so simple even I could understand it (I can't do formula, here or anywhere but An +Bn =Cn can never be a whole number for any value of A and B above 2). Fermat posed this, and in 1637 scribbled he'd solved it, and promptly snuffed it. Inconsiderate really, as for the next 350 years no one could work it out, and many tried. Until Andrew Wiles did (just 15 years before the 200 year period to claim a prize for solving it ran out too.And that's basically the book. Singh covers a lot of complicated maths in this but does so well. There are passages that get into this, but as someone more interested in the human story than advanced theoretical maths, I found they were explained for the interested reader, but a full understanding wasn't essential to enjoy the telling of the tale. As Wiles' solution was based on solving and/or bringing together a number of other theorists work, this is a bit of a flythrough of a lot of complicated maths that while brain-melting, is also impressively interesting. Singh obviously had access to Wiles - who gave the story of how he did it, and which seems to be (perhaps characteristically) shorn of much of his emotions. A fascinating story, accessibly told."

The history of the theorem is in part the history of mathematics, and so in a way the history of how we understand the world. Singh boldly takes us from 350 BC to the 20th Century, explaining mathematical theory in plain intelligible English. He is not afraid to segue either into other interesting parts of history that his mathematicians lived through, so we see the burning of the Alexandrian Library, the French Revolution and the development of computing at Bletchley Park. Through Sophie Germain he investigates the role of female mathematicians in history and how they fought to be taught in the universities and be taken seriously. The concluded chapters describes Andrew Wiles's eight-year tackling of the proof reads more like a spy novel (in the best possible way) than a book on mathematics, a testament to Singh's skill at making what might be thought a dry subject one of intrigue and excitement.It is a startling and fascinating read from start to finish.

263,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27705356-nidhi-gupta,5,"What an incredibly inspiring book!! My husband gifted this book to me in 2008, with a note ""We'll let our dreams guide us forever"". Though his note kept beckoning me to read the book, the book's rather heavy title kept me away from picking it up (even though my favorite subject in high-school was Math). Now that I've read the book, I realize how misguided my apprehension was. Simon Singh weaves such a wonderful tale of intrigue, passion, gossip, heartbreak, and persistence that surrounded the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem - the puzzle that baffled the finest mathematical brains for over 350 years. Although Fermat claimed that he had a proof of the Theorem, he did not write down this proof anywhere. Fermat's claim mocked at mathematicians for over three centuries some of whom(both men and women) invested their careers in trying to solve this rather simple looking problem.Without making any technical detail sound laborious, Singh beautifully takes us through the journey of many mathematicians who in one way or the other contributed to the epic quest to prove Fermat's Theorem. In particular, it tells us of the pursuits of one particular mathematician - Andrew Wiles - who got interested in the Theorem as a child and dedicated his career to realizing his dream of proving it. Another thing about the book that demands great merit is the comprehensible-to-layman style of writing that the author employs to tackle such a technical topic. I highly recommend this book and will definitely read other books by Simon Singh. "

Curiously, for all higher powers, there is no solution - and no proof of there being no solution either. And it remained unsolved for 350 years.We follow the progress made by stalwarts such as Euler, Fermat himself, Taniyama and Shimura among others along with delightful snippets of their lives, times and methods. The structure of pure mathematics and number theory is adequately explained along with its modern applications - especially in computing and cryptography (laymen read digital signatures). Also, please note that if you read popular science, you will not face any problems in reading this as the algebra is minimal. Also, if I can read Dawkins's books on evolution, others can easily read this :POnly problem is that I think modular forms were not adequately explained. I hope this will be corrected in future editions. This book was in my to-read list for some time but finally got around to picking it up as it was also in the selection of my recreational club's library - and they really have great taste.

265,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Great (4.5)--Although I would've appreciated a little more concrete math, Simon Singh does another superb job at explaining in lay terms what Fermat's Last Theorem meant for mathematics at large and what Andrew Wiles achieved in proving it after 350 years of numerous failures by other greatest minds of their times. It's a fascinating history whose intensity and influence can't be gleaned from just reading the theorem, which states simply:For n greater than 2, there is no whole number solution for the equation:x^(n)+y^(n)=z^(n).As simple as that. But the stories of the greatest mathematical geniuses who tried and failed in proving this theorem are so packed with tragedies, despairs, flashes of immense creativity, and human dramas that it's just a great topic to be treated in a book. Andrew Wiles's passion and sheer obsession with this theorem is moving and inspirational. How could anyone spend thirty years on a single problem when there were doubts even about the existence of a solution? Thirty years. I reel at the thought of it, and feel immense admiration for a man who kept his faith and followed his passion to the very end.Great story."

The actual proof manuscript by Andrew Wiles is 200 pages long and consists of beautiful blend of mathematical concepts with modern mathematics. Simon Singh has very beautifully explained the various approaches and attempts made to prove this theorem by mathematicians for over 350 years. She has step by step taken the reader to the times preceding the Fermat's time, to the time of Pythagoras, wherein lies the roots of this theorem. In this process she has taken us through brief life, time and works of various mathematicians whose work proved valuable in order for Andrew Wiles to proof this theorem.The book is written in a very interesting and catching style and surprisingly does not include any complex mathematics. And hence a person with basic high school understanding of mathematics can understand and grasp the concepts in this book.A must read for any mathematics fan."
267,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53101848-annabeth,4,"Good book for people who aren't math experts, but a little interested in the topic.It gives an insight not only on Fermat, his last theorem and Andrew Wiles, who eventually proved it, but also the lives of many great mathematicians before and after Fermat, their failed attempts to prove what can be considered THE THEOREM that lead to many important mathematical discoveries. It is truly remarkable - almost every mathematician of the 18th and 19th century tried to solve the problem, some were fascinated, some obsessed, and some devoted their entire lives and careers to it - until the last of them, Andrew Wiles, finally succeeded.Everyone who says math is boring has clearly never experienced the determination when you r e a l l y want to solve a problem, the despair and frustration when you rack your brain for weeks, months, or in this case, years, but can't find a solution and the joy when you finally accomplish it. This is what this book is really about. And it's educational but not too hard to understand at the same time - what more can you ask for. One of the best books about maths for non-mathematicians."
268,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65913-tim,4,"More first-rate science writing from Simon Singh. In this case he seems to have got in on the ground floor of the biggest mathematical discovery of the century -- the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994. Were it only for the reporting alone it would be worth a read, but Singh also does a creditable job of actually, you know, explaining the math. Unintimidated by Stephen Hawking's dictum that each equation reduces your sales by half, he succeeds by going big, delving as deep as he dares into the strategies of the many failed stabs at a proof, as well as Wiles' final triumph. I especially appreciated that Singh didn't shy away from the thorny abstraction of 20th century math, such as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture at the heart of the proof. A great many popular books will touch on Pythagoras and Euclid, Gauss and Germain, Hilbert and Gödel, but it's rare to read about more recent work, much less predictions for the future of mathematics (probably because it is all quite difficult and hasn't yet filtered into the public understanding)."

I love learning how math works if I don’t have to actually sit there and do the tedious work of adding and multiplying, so I really enjoyed reading about the different mathematicians who contributed to the problem’s solution, and the proofs and breakthroughs that advanced the study of math along the way. Plus the problem was finally solved by a Princeton professor, so, school pride! Not that I can really claim any personal connection to the math department, seeing as how I fell off the wagon at Calculus 104 and never made it to the cool stuff.

The book describes the origin of the theorem, and the consequent journey towards the proof. The proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians! However, this apparently innocuous theorem stimulated the development of number theory in mathematics. And it all started with Fermat's famous margin note ""I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.""Simon Singh has described it all beautifully, in a simple but attractive, exemplifying every new concept. I would not recommended this book to anyone who hasn't at least done maths till high school, simply because even though the book is written in simplified terms, only someone who loves maths would truly enjoy the book.

The book also included the actual proofs in the appendix (for the simple ones) and at least bothered to name-drop technical terms (so I could research them) before going on to simplify them for the casual reader.During certain parts, it felt like things were being over-simplified and getting repetitive, but those are minor grievances I'm willing to overlook.The book's inspiring and _tons_ of fun if you're even a little interested in Math! :D"

A lot of the actual maths baffled me a bit, but they're not the main point of this book.Rather, it shows the single minded obsession that someone can have as they try and solve something that possibly only a few others could.The book is well written and has an interesting story behind it, with tension rising in the last few chapters.

Wiles followed his childhood dream and after establishing himself in the academia he worked for years in total secrecy to find a solution to a problem that was by many already considered unbreakable. Singh did a superb job to introduce readers to the long history of Fermat's theorem and dropped enough breadcrumbs for anyone with basic understanding of high school math to follow the developing mystery from its inception to its final stages, establishing Wiles as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.

Fermat's last theorem that has baffled mathematicians from last 300 years was finally solved by Andrew Wiles in the 90s, but the proof, which creatively uses the best of traditional and twentieth century mathematical advances, is difficult to understand for the general reader. Singh tackles the problem by clearly explaining basics to keep the reader interested and invests pages over pages in curious sketches of mathematicians who spent their lives around the proof.

286,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1752430-drew,5,"I remember sitting in an office with a friend and downloading his proof when it was published. I had a small background in abstract algebra and I was able to get through a few pages, but then became utterly lost. I was still enthralled and flipped through it like it was a gift for my birthday! Based on recommendations from two people, I jumped into Simon Singh’s book on Fermat’s Last Theorem.Singh is a fantastic writer. His writing is lucid and fluid: never too many words, but also never too few. I enjoyed the mathematical background (and enjoyed working through the appendices), historical tidbits, how mathematicians work and the actual story of Wiles’s approach to the proof. It was a detective story with a touch of romance and history to it. It was exciting as each piece of the puzzle came together. I knew the ending and I still couldn’t wait to work through each page!I enjoyed the history that Singh provided, from the classical Greek mathematic Pythagorus, up through the centuries to Fermat and then to the present. This was a lovely romp through my two true academic loves: mathematics and classical studies. I was happy that he incorporated the story of female mathematicians into his narrative, something I didn’t know and that rarely pops up in general discussion of great mathematicians. Also, I enjoyed the chapter devoted to Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura, and their conjecture that sought to equate modular forms with elliptic equations. This conjecture was the ultimate lever that Wiles used to prove Fermat’s theorem.Singh also builds a strong case for pure research, even into seemingly unimportant topics. Fermat’s theorem was a cool idea, but on its own, it really didn’t seem that crucial. Yet the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, and the follow on work by Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet, tied a solution to something that would unite disparate parts of very important contemporary mathematics. Fermat provided the motivation, originally by accident, to improving modern mathematics. Wiles said “the definition of a good mathematical problem is the mathematics it generates rather than the problem itself” (p. 163).As for Wiles, he did amazing work and fulfilled his childhood dream. The book ends with a quote from him that I take to heart: “I had this very rare privilege of being able to pursue in my adult life what had been my childhood dream. I know it’s a rare privilege, but if you can tackle something in adult life that means that much to you then it’s more rewarding than anything imaginable” (p. 285).My problem with Wiles is that his success was due to other people doing what he refused to do. I think Singh implies it occasionally. Wiles succeeded because he was able to look at the work and ideas that other mathematics published. Taniyama, Shimura, Frey, Ribet and others had interesting insights directly or indirectly related to Fermat’s Last Theorem. They could have kept those ideas secret, like Wiles did. But, that would have slowed, or possibly stopped him in his tracks. He kept his task secret for seven years, even going so far as to publish unrelated work to throw people ‘off the scent.’ I know this was his lifelong dream and he wanted to solve it on his own. But, mathematical progress seems fastest when ideas are put out into the community and others can add their points of view. This isn’t meant diminish Wiles’s intellect or accomplishment, but it makes me wonder if Fermat’s theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture could have been proved sooner. Most mathematicians, including Wiles, seemingly went into mathematics due to the beauty of the system, rather than for money or glory.I highly recommend this book to everyone, from people with no interest in math up to PhD’s at the top of the field.

287,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27525841-lyle-regenwetter,4,"Fermat's Enigma is the first nonfiction book I have read in a while, and it exceeded my initially non-optimistic expectations in several ways. This book discusses Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous mathematical problems ever known to man. x^2+y^2=z^2 is a very familiar problem, appears frequently in mathematics, including in the Pythagorean Theorem for the relationship of Side Lengths of Right triangles. x^3+y^3=z^3 is a very similar problem, except for the fact that there are no real solutions. Furthermore, the proof remained a mystery to mathematicians for decades. How could such a deceptively simple problem be so difficult to solve? Contrary to my initial expectations, Fermat's Enigma focused less on the mathematics and more on the story of the quest of mathematicians to find the proof. The Author, Singh, did a fabulous job of making this boring story of a handful of lonely mathematicians into a story that actually interested me. As I said, my expectations were low going into this book. I was expecting a rather boring read, just something to read until I could find something more interesting, in fact. Although far from being action-packed, Fermat's Enigma kept me entertained in my free time for a few days. For those intimidated by mathematics, especially this unsolvably difficult problem, not to worry: Singh made this book very easy to comprehend. I had no trouble understanding the mathematical details incorporated into the plot, and I am sure the majority of readers could do the same. Before reading this book, in fact, I had already watched a documentary outlining he more technical mathematical aspects of the proof, which was in fact, related to another unsolved mathematical problem. The less technical nature of the book suited my interests nicely, because I got an interesting story out of this book, instead of a repetition of material that I am already familiar with. Consequently, I give this book 4 stars because, although not as exciting as I would have preferred, this book exceeded expectations and gave me a good read that I could think about in my spare time. In my opinion, this book gave a perfect amount of mathematical detail so that the average reader would be able to comprehend, but not see right through the mathematics. In addition, the average reader would most definitely take away some mathematical knowledge that they could apply to some things, or at least be able to discuss with or entertain a friend. This book was written in a similar style to The Code Book, also by Simon Singh. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a nonfiction book and put in a little bit of brainpower while reading. This is a great opportunity to experience the challenges and the research of the modern-day mathematician."
288,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"I wish I'd learned mathematics the way this book is written.The essence of mathematics and its complex theorems are explained in such simple, captivating and logical terms that even a non-Mathematician can easily comprehend. The book is about how a theorem developed by an amateur mathematician Fermat was successfully proved after hundreds of years. The theorem itself is very simple: No three positive integers satisfy the equation below when n is greater than 2.X^n + Y^n = Z^n This equation is similar to Pythagorean theorem (in fact, the Pythagorean theorem is the specific case of Fermat's last theorem in which n is equal 2). We know from our middle school math class that solutions exist in that case; in fact, sides of a right angle triangle can be expressed by this equation when n is equal to 2. And yet, when n=3 or above no integer solution exists. Fermat, himself, did not provide proof for his theorem, simply stating that he had no space to write down the solution of this problem. Whether he indeed proved his theorem or not is still debatable, but as far as we know, it took mathematicians all over the world for over three hundred years to prove his theorem. Rumor has it that the actual proof is over a hundred pages!The book is full of examples of how countless mathematicians ""wasted"" their entire lives to find the solution to this problem. One of the most heartbreaking stories is definitely the story of a Japanese mathematician Taniyama who committed suicide leaving a suicide note stating how tired he was and that he lost confidence in his future. Although largely criticized for his work during his lifetime, his conjecture has been a vital part in solving the Fermat's Last Theorem. It was heartbreaking but invigorating at times to learn about the lives of these mathematicians and how dedicated and obsessive they were about doing mathematics. The book also mentions the death of Archimedes who was so engrossed in his mathematical study that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman Soldier during the War and was speared to death. Although not many people would like the idea of being obsessed with something so deeply that it results in their own death, I wish I had that obsession - something that I could die for. They say ""Find what you love and let it kill you"". To say that it is the most ideal death may not be an exaggeration after reading this book :POverall, this book is highly recommended for scientists or mathematicians or simply anyone who needs some inspiration to get involved in academia."
289,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42757570-chaitanya-sethi,5,"What a fantastic book! I never could have imagined that one could write nearly 300 pages on a mathematical equation and make it genuinely exciting and fun to read! It really is the skill of the author to have built such a narrative around a topic that most people would overlook as something dull and uninteresting.Mathematics and mathematicians are both reputed to be dry and even intimidating, but this book does a brilliant job of changing that image. I had always enjoyed mathematics in school but had never ventured into the lives of the people who were responsible for the theorems and postulates that I would mindlessly apply. I really thank Simon for adding colour to their lives. In my head, most of them were indistinguishable from one another, and somehow, I would always assume them to be socially awkward, brooding people. Thank you for turning this silly stereotype of mine on its head. I can finally appreciate what Pythagoras did in his time (IMO his secret school called the Semicircle of Pythagoras, is the coolest cult/group name ever!), how tragically his life ended due to the political scenario during that time, I can admire Euclid's sass when he expelled a student when the student asked him the ""practical application"" of the education (but not before asking his slave to give the student a coin to send him off), I can think over the tragic life of Galois, who died, at the age of 20, shrouded in mystery of what he could have been, and most importantly I can think over the women mathematicians, who braved social discrimination and prejudice to still contribute to Fermat's problem and mathematics in general.While the story ends at the eventual discovery of the proof by Andrew Wiles, it meanders effortlessly through centuries and builds a narrative that enables one to understand what achievements took place before Fermat's time, how Fermat's eccentricities and his ever so popular Last Theorem was an annoyance to all, and finally what developments over the last few centuries enabled Wiley to claim his stake upon the problem. Alongside this, the author adds tidbits in the Appendix to keep it fun throughout.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is positively wonderful."
290,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31656053-victor-davis,5,"I am blown away by this book. I've read so many nonfiction math and physics books that they were starting to repeat themselves. So, when I picked this one up I thought, ""Well, it's probably more of the same, but it's popular enough I should really add it to my repertoire."" Way wrong thought. Not only does this book contain even more charming mathematical anecdotes than I'd ever read before, but it also contains better written versions of the stories I'd heard of. For example, I knew about Sophie Germain, but I didn't know she'd saved Gauss' life. I knew all about the burning of Alexandria, but I didn't know it was Mark Antony who attempted to rebuild the great library. I knew Galois died young in a duel, but I never knew the full story.I read The Code Book in high school, and I remember it being good, but in a recreational way. It piqued my interest but I didn't really shelf it with ""high literature"" like I did with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid or Music of the Spheres: The Material Universe From Atom to Quaser, Simply Explained. It was enough for me, a young geeky teenager, to have a little fun playing with codes, then move on to another book. I am very happy that I returned to Singh, and I can confidently say this is the better of the two I've read. Mathematicians sure are a romantic lot."
291,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27336185-kenny,3," I'm not a maths person. I pretty much hated it at school, and pulled myself through somehow. So I was reading this as I was much more interested in the story of solving a problem that confounded the finest minds in maths for 300 years. It's based on the comment in the margins of a text from 17th century maths-genius/possibly most frustrating man in history Pierre de Fermat. A concept so simple even I could understand it (I can't do formula, here or anywhere but An +Bn =Cn can never be a whole number for any value of A and B above 2). Fermat posed this, and in 1637 scribbled he'd solved it, and promptly snuffed it. Inconsiderate really, as for the next 350 years no one could work it out, and many tried. Until Andrew Wiles did (just 15 years before the 200 year period to claim a prize for solving it ran out too.And that's basically the book. Singh covers a lot of complicated maths in this but does so well. There are passages that get into this, but as someone more interested in the human story than advanced theoretical maths, I found they were explained for the interested reader, but a full understanding wasn't essential to enjoy the telling of the tale. As Wiles' solution was based on solving and/or bringing together a number of other theorists work, this is a bit of a flythrough of a lot of complicated maths that while brain-melting, is also impressively interesting. Singh obviously had access to Wiles - who gave the story of how he did it, and which seems to be (perhaps characteristically) shorn of much of his emotions. A fascinating story, accessibly told."
292,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65863-elizabeth,5,"Fermat's Last Theorem is simple enough that anyone who understands Pythagorus' technique for finding the longest side of a right-angled triangle, can understand the conjecture that Fermat provides:a^n + b^n = c^n has no solutions in positive integers, if n is an integer greater than 2What is not easily understood is the story of how it was proved some 350 years later, but Simon Singh turns this story, over three-hundred years of mathematics, into a manageable and thrilling (yes thrilling!) read. The history of the theorem is in part the history of mathematics, and so in a way the history of how we understand the world. Singh boldly takes us from 350 BC to the 20th Century, explaining mathematical theory in plain intelligible English. He is not afraid to segue either into other interesting parts of history that his mathematicians lived through, so we see the burning of the Alexandrian Library, the French Revolution and the development of computing at Bletchley Park. Through Sophie Germain he investigates the role of female mathematicians in history and how they fought to be taught in the universities and be taken seriously. The concluded chapters describes Andrew Wiles's eight-year tackling of the proof reads more like a spy novel (in the best possible way) than a book on mathematics, a testament to Singh's skill at making what might be thought a dry subject one of intrigue and excitement.It is a startling and fascinating read from start to finish. "
293,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27705356-nidhi-gupta,5,"What an incredibly inspiring book!! My husband gifted this book to me in 2008, with a note ""We'll let our dreams guide us forever"". Though his note kept beckoning me to read the book, the book's rather heavy title kept me away from picking it up (even though my favorite subject in high-school was Math). Now that I've read the book, I realize how misguided my apprehension was. Simon Singh weaves such a wonderful tale of intrigue, passion, gossip, heartbreak, and persistence that surrounded the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem - the puzzle that baffled the finest mathematical brains for over 350 years. Although Fermat claimed that he had a proof of the Theorem, he did not write down this proof anywhere. Fermat's claim mocked at mathematicians for over three centuries some of whom(both men and women) invested their careers in trying to solve this rather simple looking problem.Without making any technical detail sound laborious, Singh beautifully takes us through the journey of many mathematicians who in one way or the other contributed to the epic quest to prove Fermat's Theorem. In particular, it tells us of the pursuits of one particular mathematician - Andrew Wiles - who got interested in the Theorem as a child and dedicated his career to realizing his dream of proving it. Another thing about the book that demands great merit is the comprehensible-to-layman style of writing that the author employs to tackle such a technical topic. I highly recommend this book and will definitely read other books by Simon Singh. "

Curiously, for all higher powers, there is no solution - and no proof of there being no solution either. And it remained unsolved for 350 years.We follow the progress made by stalwarts such as Euler, Fermat himself, Taniyama and Shimura among others along with delightful snippets of their lives, times and methods. The structure of pure mathematics and number theory is adequately explained along with its modern applications - especially in computing and cryptography (laymen read digital signatures). Also, please note that if you read popular science, you will not face any problems in reading this as the algebra is minimal. Also, if I can read Dawkins's books on evolution, others can easily read this :POnly problem is that I think modular forms were not adequately explained. I hope this will be corrected in future editions. This book was in my to-read list for some time but finally got around to picking it up as it was also in the selection of my recreational club's library - and they really have great taste. Worth a read and I will be reading more by the author !"
295,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Great (4.5)--Although I would've appreciated a little more concrete math, Simon Singh does another superb job at explaining in lay terms what Fermat's Last Theorem meant for mathematics at large and what Andrew Wiles achieved in proving it after 350 years of numerous failures by other greatest minds of their times. It's a fascinating history whose intensity and influence can't be gleaned from just reading the theorem, which states simply:For n greater than 2, there is no whole number solution for the equation:x^(n)+y^(n)=z^(n).As simple as that. But the stories of the greatest mathematical geniuses who tried and failed in proving this theorem are so packed with tragedies, despairs, flashes of immense creativity, and human dramas that it's just a great topic to be treated in a book. Andrew Wiles's passion and sheer obsession with this theorem is moving and inspirational. How could anyone spend thirty years on a single problem when there were doubts even about the existence of a solution? Thirty years. I reel at the thought of it, and feel immense admiration for a man who kept his faith and followed his passion to the very end.Great story."

The actual proof manuscript by Andrew Wiles is 200 pages long and consists of beautiful blend of mathematical concepts with modern mathematics. Simon Singh has very beautifully explained the various approaches and attempts made to prove this theorem by mathematicians for over 350 years. She has step by step taken the reader to the times preceding the Fermat's time, to the time of Pythagoras, wherein lies the roots of this theorem. In this process she has taken us through brief life, time and works of various mathematicians whose work proved valuable in order for Andrew Wiles to proof this theorem.The book is written in a very interesting and catching style and surprisingly does not include any complex mathematics. And hence a person with basic high school understanding of mathematics can understand and grasp the concepts in this book.A must read for any mathematics fan."
297,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53101848-annabeth,4,"Good book for people who aren't math experts, but a little interested in the topic.It gives an insight not only on Fermat, his last theorem and Andrew Wiles, who eventually proved it, but also the lives of many great mathematicians before and after Fermat, their failed attempts to prove what can be considered THE THEOREM that lead to many important mathematical discoveries. It is truly remarkable - almost every mathematician of the 18th and 19th century tried to solve the problem, some were fascinated, some obsessed, and some devoted their entire lives and careers to it - until the last of them, Andrew Wiles, finally succeeded.Everyone who says math is boring has clearly never experienced the determination when you r e a l l y want to solve a problem, the despair and frustration when you rack your brain for weeks, months, or in this case, years, but can't find a solution and the joy when you finally accomplish it. This is what this book is really about. And it's educational but not too hard to understand at the same time - what more can you ask for. One of the best books about maths for non-mathematicians."
298,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65913-tim,4,"More first-rate science writing from Simon Singh. In this case he seems to have got in on the ground floor of the biggest mathematical discovery of the century -- the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994. Were it only for the reporting alone it would be worth a read, but Singh also does a creditable job of actually, you know, explaining the math. Unintimidated by Stephen Hawking's dictum that each equation reduces your sales by half, he succeeds by going big, delving as deep as he dares into the strategies of the many failed stabs at a proof, as well as Wiles' final triumph. I especially appreciated that Singh didn't shy away from the thorny abstraction of 20th century math, such as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture at the heart of the proof. A great many popular books will touch on Pythagoras and Euclid, Gauss and Germain, Hilbert and Gödel, but it's rare to read about more recent work, much less predictions for the future of mathematics (probably because it is all quite difficult and hasn't yet filtered into the public understanding)."

I love learning how math works if I don’t have to actually sit there and do the tedious work of adding and multiplying, so I really enjoyed reading about the different mathematicians who contributed to the problem’s solution, and the proofs and breakthroughs that advanced the study of math along the way. Plus the problem was finally solved by a Princeton professor, so, school pride! Not that I can really claim any personal connection to the math department, seeing as how I fell off the wagon at Calculus 104 and never made it to the cool stuff.

The book describes the origin of the theorem, and the consequent journey towards the proof. The proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians! However, this apparently innocuous theorem stimulated the development of number theory in mathematics. And it all started with Fermat's famous margin note ""I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.""Simon Singh has described it all beautifully, in a simple but attractive, exemplifying every new concept. I would not recommended this book to anyone who hasn't at least done maths till high school, simply because even though the book is written in simplified terms, only someone who loves maths would truly enjoy the book.

The book also included the actual proofs in the appendix (for the simple ones) and at least bothered to name-drop technical terms (so I could research them) before going on to simplify them for the casual reader.During certain parts, it felt like things were being over-simplified and getting repetitive, but those are minor grievances I'm willing to overlook.The book's inspiring and _tons_ of fun if you're even a little interested in Math! :D"

Singh explains the ideas behind the eventual solution in a clear manner. A lot of the actual maths baffled me a bit, but they're not the main point of this book.Rather, it shows the single minded obsession that someone can have as they try and solve something that possibly only a few others could.The book is well written and has an interesting story behind it, with tension rising in the last few chapters.

It tells the full “story of a riddle that confounded the world's greatest minds for 358 years” — until mathematician Andrew Wiles found a proof in 1993 to a problem formulated centuries earlier by the infamous riddler Pierre de Fermat. Wiles followed his childhood dream and after establishing himself in the academia he worked for years in total secrecy to find a solution to a problem that was by many already considered unbreakable. Singh did a superb job to introduce readers to the long history of Fermat's theorem and dropped enough breadcrumbs for anyone with basic understanding of high school math to follow the developing mystery from its inception to its final stages, establishing Wiles as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.

Fermat's last theorem that has baffled mathematicians from last 300 years was finally solved by Andrew Wiles in the 90s, but the proof, which creatively uses the best of traditional and twentieth century mathematical advances, is difficult to understand for the general reader. Singh tackles the problem by clearly explaining basics to keep the reader interested and invests pages over pages in curious sketches of mathematicians who spent their lives around the proof.

Of course, when the Fermat theorem was finally proven, it was a big deal for our teacher, who always suspected Fermat had bluffed and had never completed the demonstration. When we asked him how it was proven, we were told our level was too poor to understand (That’s the beauty of the French school system: teachers are very honest.).I read Simon Singh’s book 17 years later and I am glad to have at last an approximate idea of the theorem’s demonstration.

316,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1752430-drew,5,"I remember sitting in an office with a friend and downloading his proof when it was published. I had a small background in abstract algebra and I was able to get through a few pages, but then became utterly lost. I was still enthralled and flipped through it like it was a gift for my birthday! Based on recommendations from two people, I jumped into Simon Singh’s book on Fermat’s Last Theorem.Singh is a fantastic writer. His writing is lucid and fluid: never too many words, but also never too few. I enjoyed the mathematical background (and enjoyed working through the appendices), historical tidbits, how mathematicians work and the actual story of Wiles’s approach to the proof. It was a detective story with a touch of romance and history to it. It was exciting as each piece of the puzzle came together. I knew the ending and I still couldn’t wait to work through each page!I enjoyed the history that Singh provided, from the classical Greek mathematic Pythagorus, up through the centuries to Fermat and then to the present. This was a lovely romp through my two true academic loves: mathematics and classical studies. I was happy that he incorporated the story of female mathematicians into his narrative, something I didn’t know and that rarely pops up in general discussion of great mathematicians. Also, I enjoyed the chapter devoted to Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura, and their conjecture that sought to equate modular forms with elliptic equations. This conjecture was the ultimate lever that Wiles used to prove Fermat’s theorem.Singh also builds a strong case for pure research, even into seemingly unimportant topics. Fermat’s theorem was a cool idea, but on its own, it really didn’t seem that crucial. Yet the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, and the follow on work by Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet, tied a solution to something that would unite disparate parts of very important contemporary mathematics. Fermat provided the motivation, originally by accident, to improving modern mathematics. Wiles said “the definition of a good mathematical problem is the mathematics it generates rather than the problem itself” (p. 163).As for Wiles, he did amazing work and fulfilled his childhood dream. The book ends with a quote from him that I take to heart: “I had this very rare privilege of being able to pursue in my adult life what had been my childhood dream. I know it’s a rare privilege, but if you can tackle something in adult life that means that much to you then it’s more rewarding than anything imaginable” (p. 285).My problem with Wiles is that his success was due to other people doing what he refused to do. I think Singh implies it occasionally. Wiles succeeded because he was able to look at the work and ideas that other mathematics published. Taniyama, Shimura, Frey, Ribet and others had interesting insights directly or indirectly related to Fermat’s Last Theorem. They could have kept those ideas secret, like Wiles did. But, that would have slowed, or possibly stopped him in his tracks. He kept his task secret for seven years, even going so far as to publish unrelated work to throw people ‘off the scent.’ I know this was his lifelong dream and he wanted to solve it on his own. But, mathematical progress seems fastest when ideas are put out into the community and others can add their points of view. This isn’t meant diminish Wiles’s intellect or accomplishment, but it makes me wonder if Fermat’s theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture could have been proved sooner. Most mathematicians, including Wiles, seemingly went into mathematics due to the beauty of the system, rather than for money or glory.I highly recommend this book to everyone, from people with no interest in math up to PhD’s at the top of the field.

317,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27525841-lyle-regenwetter,4,"Fermat's Enigma is the first nonfiction book I have read in a while, and it exceeded my initially non-optimistic expectations in several ways. This book discusses Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous mathematical problems ever known to man. x^2+y^2=z^2 is a very familiar problem, appears frequently in mathematics, including in the Pythagorean Theorem for the relationship of Side Lengths of Right triangles. x^3+y^3=z^3 is a very similar problem, except for the fact that there are no real solutions. Furthermore, the proof remained a mystery to mathematicians for decades. How could such a deceptively simple problem be so difficult to solve? Contrary to my initial expectations, Fermat's Enigma focused less on the mathematics and more on the story of the quest of mathematicians to find the proof. The Author, Singh, did a fabulous job of making this boring story of a handful of lonely mathematicians into a story that actually interested me. As I said, my expectations were low going into this book. I was expecting a rather boring read, just something to read until I could find something more interesting, in fact. Although far from being action-packed, Fermat's Enigma kept me entertained in my free time for a few days. For those intimidated by mathematics, especially this unsolvably difficult problem, not to worry: Singh made this book very easy to comprehend. I had no trouble understanding the mathematical details incorporated into the plot, and I am sure the majority of readers could do the same. Before reading this book, in fact, I had already watched a documentary outlining he more technical mathematical aspects of the proof, which was in fact, related to another unsolved mathematical problem. The less technical nature of the book suited my interests nicely, because I got an interesting story out of this book, instead of a repetition of material that I am already familiar with. Consequently, I give this book 4 stars because, although not as exciting as I would have preferred, this book exceeded expectations and gave me a good read that I could think about in my spare time. In my opinion, this book gave a perfect amount of mathematical detail so that the average reader would be able to comprehend, but not see right through the mathematics. In addition, the average reader would most definitely take away some mathematical knowledge that they could apply to some things, or at least be able to discuss with or entertain a friend. This book was written in a similar style to The Code Book, also by Simon Singh. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a nonfiction book and put in a little bit of brainpower while reading. This is a great opportunity to experience the challenges and the research of the modern-day mathematician."
318,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"I wish I'd learned mathematics the way this book is written.The essence of mathematics and its complex theorems are explained in such simple, captivating and logical terms that even a non-Mathematician can easily comprehend. The book is about how a theorem developed by an amateur mathematician Fermat was successfully proved after hundreds of years. The theorem itself is very simple: No three positive integers satisfy the equation below when n is greater than 2.X^n + Y^n = Z^n This equation is similar to Pythagorean theorem (in fact, the Pythagorean theorem is the specific case of Fermat's last theorem in which n is equal 2). We know from our middle school math class that solutions exist in that case; in fact, sides of a right angle triangle can be expressed by this equation when n is equal to 2. And yet, when n=3 or above no integer solution exists. Fermat, himself, did not provide proof for his theorem, simply stating that he had no space to write down the solution of this problem. Whether he indeed proved his theorem or not is still debatable, but as far as we know, it took mathematicians all over the world for over three hundred years to prove his theorem. Rumor has it that the actual proof is over a hundred pages!The book is full of examples of how countless mathematicians ""wasted"" their entire lives to find the solution to this problem. One of the most heartbreaking stories is definitely the story of a Japanese mathematician Taniyama who committed suicide leaving a suicide note stating how tired he was and that he lost confidence in his future. Although largely criticized for his work during his lifetime, his conjecture has been a vital part in solving the Fermat's Last Theorem. It was heartbreaking but invigorating at times to learn about the lives of these mathematicians and how dedicated and obsessive they were about doing mathematics. The book also mentions the death of Archimedes who was so engrossed in his mathematical study that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman Soldier during the War and was speared to death. Although not many people would like the idea of being obsessed with something so deeply that it results in their own death, I wish I had that obsession - something that I could die for. They say ""Find what you love and let it kill you"". To say that it is the most ideal death may not be an exaggeration after reading this book :POverall, this book is highly recommended for scientists or mathematicians or simply anyone who needs some inspiration to get involved in academia."
319,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42757570-chaitanya-sethi,5,"What a fantastic book! I never could have imagined that one could write nearly 300 pages on a mathematical equation and make it genuinely exciting and fun to read! It really is the skill of the author to have built such a narrative around a topic that most people would overlook as something dull and uninteresting.Mathematics and mathematicians are both reputed to be dry and even intimidating, but this book does a brilliant job of changing that image. I had always enjoyed mathematics in school but had never ventured into the lives of the people who were responsible for the theorems and postulates that I would mindlessly apply. I really thank Simon for adding colour to their lives. In my head, most of them were indistinguishable from one another, and somehow, I would always assume them to be socially awkward, brooding people. Thank you for turning this silly stereotype of mine on its head. I can finally appreciate what Pythagoras did in his time (IMO his secret school called the Semicircle of Pythagoras, is the coolest cult/group name ever!), how tragically his life ended due to the political scenario during that time, I can admire Euclid's sass when he expelled a student when the student asked him the ""practical application"" of the education (but not before asking his slave to give the student a coin to send him off), I can think over the tragic life of Galois, who died, at the age of 20, shrouded in mystery of what he could have been, and most importantly I can think over the women mathematicians, who braved social discrimination and prejudice to still contribute to Fermat's problem and mathematics in general.While the story ends at the eventual discovery of the proof by Andrew Wiles, it meanders effortlessly through centuries and builds a narrative that enables one to understand what achievements took place before Fermat's time, how Fermat's eccentricities and his ever so popular Last Theorem was an annoyance to all, and finally what developments over the last few centuries enabled Wiley to claim his stake upon the problem. Alongside this, the author adds tidbits in the Appendix to keep it fun throughout.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is positively wonderful."
320,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31656053-victor-davis,5,"I am blown away by this book. I've read so many nonfiction math and physics books that they were starting to repeat themselves. So, when I picked this one up I thought, ""Well, it's probably more of the same, but it's popular enough I should really add it to my repertoire."" Way wrong thought. Not only does this book contain even more charming mathematical anecdotes than I'd ever read before, but it also contains better written versions of the stories I'd heard of. For example, I knew about Sophie Germain, but I didn't know she'd saved Gauss' life. I knew all about the burning of Alexandria, but I didn't know it was Mark Antony who attempted to rebuild the great library. I knew Galois died young in a duel, but I never knew the full story.I read The Code Book in high school, and I remember it being good, but in a recreational way. It piqued my interest but I didn't really shelf it with ""high literature"" like I did with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid or Music of the Spheres: The Material Universe From Atom to Quaser, Simply Explained. It was enough for me, a young geeky teenager, to have a little fun playing with codes, then move on to another book. I am very happy that I returned to Singh, and I can confidently say this is the better of the two I've read. Mathematicians sure are a romantic lot."
321,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27336185-kenny,3," I'm not a maths person. I pretty much hated it at school, and pulled myself through somehow. So I was reading this as I was much more interested in the story of solving a problem that confounded the finest minds in maths for 300 years. It's based on the comment in the margins of a text from 17th century maths-genius/possibly most frustrating man in history Pierre de Fermat. A concept so simple even I could understand it (I can't do formula, here or anywhere but An +Bn =Cn can never be a whole number for any value of A and B above 2). Fermat posed this, and in 1637 scribbled he'd solved it, and promptly snuffed it. Inconsiderate really, as for the next 350 years no one could work it out, and many tried. Until Andrew Wiles did (just 15 years before the 200 year period to claim a prize for solving it ran out too.And that's basically the book. Singh covers a lot of complicated maths in this but does so well. There are passages that get into this, but as someone more interested in the human story than advanced theoretical maths, I found they were explained for the interested reader, but a full understanding wasn't essential to enjoy the telling of the tale. As Wiles' solution was based on solving and/or bringing together a number of other theorists work, this is a bit of a flythrough of a lot of complicated maths that while brain-melting, is also impressively interesting. Singh obviously had access to Wiles - who gave the story of how he did it, and which seems to be (perhaps characteristically) shorn of much of his emotions. A fascinating story, accessibly told."
322,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65863-elizabeth,5,"Fermat's Last Theorem is simple enough that anyone who understands Pythagorus' technique for finding the longest side of a right-angled triangle, can understand the conjecture that Fermat provides:a^n + b^n = c^n has no solutions in positive integers, if n is an integer greater than 2What is not easily understood is the story of how it was proved some 350 years later, but Simon Singh turns this story, over three-hundred years of mathematics, into a manageable and thrilling (yes thrilling!) read. The history of the theorem is in part the history of mathematics, and so in a way the history of how we understand the world. Singh boldly takes us from 350 BC to the 20th Century, explaining mathematical theory in plain intelligible English. He is not afraid to segue either into other interesting parts of history that his mathematicians lived through, so we see the burning of the Alexandrian Library, the French Revolution and the development of computing at Bletchley Park. Through Sophie Germain he investigates the role of female mathematicians in history and how they fought to be taught in the universities and be taken seriously. The concluded chapters describes Andrew Wiles's eight-year tackling of the proof reads more like a spy novel (in the best possible way) than a book on mathematics, a testament to Singh's skill at making what might be thought a dry subject one of intrigue and excitement.It is a startling and fascinating read from start to finish. "
323,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27705356-nidhi-gupta,5,"What an incredibly inspiring book!! My husband gifted this book to me in 2008, with a note ""We'll let our dreams guide us forever"". Though his note kept beckoning me to read the book, the book's rather heavy title kept me away from picking it up (even though my favorite subject in high-school was Math). Now that I've read the book, I realize how misguided my apprehension was. Simon Singh weaves such a wonderful tale of intrigue, passion, gossip, heartbreak, and persistence that surrounded the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem - the puzzle that baffled the finest mathematical brains for over 350 years. Although Fermat claimed that he had a proof of the Theorem, he did not write down this proof anywhere. Fermat's claim mocked at mathematicians for over three centuries some of whom(both men and women) invested their careers in trying to solve this rather simple looking problem.Without making any technical detail sound laborious, Singh beautifully takes us through the journey of many mathematicians who in one way or the other contributed to the epic quest to prove Fermat's Theorem. In particular, it tells us of the pursuits of one particular mathematician - Andrew Wiles - who got interested in the Theorem as a child and dedicated his career to realizing his dream of proving it. Another thing about the book that demands great merit is the comprehensible-to-layman style of writing that the author employs to tackle such a technical topic. I highly recommend this book and will definitely read other books by Simon Singh. "

Curiously, for all higher powers, there is no solution - and no proof of there being no solution either. And it remained unsolved for 350 years.We follow the progress made by stalwarts such as Euler, Fermat himself, Taniyama and Shimura among others along with delightful snippets of their lives, times and methods. The structure of pure mathematics and number theory is adequately explained along with its modern applications - especially in computing and cryptography (laymen read digital signatures). Also, please note that if you read popular science, you will not face any problems in reading this as the algebra is minimal. Also, if I can read Dawkins's books on evolution, others can easily read this :POnly problem is that I think modular forms were not adequately explained. I hope this will be corrected in future editions. This book was in my to-read list for some time but finally got around to picking it up as it was also in the selection of my recreational club's library - and they really have great taste.

325,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Great (4.5)--Although I would've appreciated a little more concrete math, Simon Singh does another superb job at explaining in lay terms what Fermat's Last Theorem meant for mathematics at large and what Andrew Wiles achieved in proving it after 350 years of numerous failures by other greatest minds of their times. It's a fascinating history whose intensity and influence can't be gleaned from just reading the theorem, which states simply:For n greater than 2, there is no whole number solution for the equation:x^(n)+y^(n)=z^(n).As simple as that. But the stories of the greatest mathematical geniuses who tried and failed in proving this theorem are so packed with tragedies, despairs, flashes of immense creativity, and human dramas that it's just a great topic to be treated in a book. Andrew Wiles's passion and sheer obsession with this theorem is moving and inspirational. How could anyone spend thirty years on a single problem when there were doubts even about the existence of a solution? Thirty years. I reel at the thought of it, and feel immense admiration for a man who kept his faith and followed his passion to the very end.Great story."

The actual proof manuscript by Andrew Wiles is 200 pages long and consists of beautiful blend of mathematical concepts with modern mathematics. Simon Singh has very beautifully explained the various approaches and attempts made to prove this theorem by mathematicians for over 350 years. She has step by step taken the reader to the times preceding the Fermat's time, to the time of Pythagoras, wherein lies the roots of this theorem. In this process she has taken us through brief life, time and works of various mathematicians whose work proved valuable in order for Andrew Wiles to proof this theorem.The book is written in a very interesting and catching style and surprisingly does not include any complex mathematics. And hence a person with basic high school understanding of mathematics can understand and grasp the concepts in this book.A must read for any mathematics fan."
327,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53101848-annabeth,4,"Good book for people who aren't math experts, but a little interested in the topic.It gives an insight not only on Fermat, his last theorem and Andrew Wiles, who eventually proved it, but also the lives of many great mathematicians before and after Fermat, their failed attempts to prove what can be considered THE THEOREM that lead to many important mathematical discoveries. It is truly remarkable - almost every mathematician of the 18th and 19th century tried to solve the problem, some were fascinated, some obsessed, and some devoted their entire lives and careers to it - until the last of them, Andrew Wiles, finally succeeded.Everyone who says math is boring has clearly never experienced the determination when you r e a l l y want to solve a problem, the despair and frustration when you rack your brain for weeks, months, or in this case, years, but can't find a solution and the joy when you finally accomplish it. This is what this book is really about. And it's educational but not too hard to understand at the same time - what more can you ask for. One of the best books about maths for non-mathematicians."
328,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65913-tim,4,"More first-rate science writing from Simon Singh. In this case he seems to have got in on the ground floor of the biggest mathematical discovery of the century -- the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994. Were it only for the reporting alone it would be worth a read, but Singh also does a creditable job of actually, you know, explaining the math. Unintimidated by Stephen Hawking's dictum that each equation reduces your sales by half, he succeeds by going big, delving as deep as he dares into the strategies of the many failed stabs at a proof, as well as Wiles' final triumph. I especially appreciated that Singh didn't shy away from the thorny abstraction of 20th century math, such as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture at the heart of the proof. A great many popular books will touch on Pythagoras and Euclid, Gauss and Germain, Hilbert and Gödel, but it's rare to read about more recent work, much less predictions for the future of mathematics (probably because it is all quite difficult and hasn't yet filtered into the public understanding)."

I love learning how math works if I don’t have to actually sit there and do the tedious work of adding and multiplying, so I really enjoyed reading about the different mathematicians who contributed to the problem’s solution, and the proofs and breakthroughs that advanced the study of math along the way. Plus the problem was finally solved by a Princeton professor, so, school pride! Not that I can really claim any personal connection to the math department, seeing as how I fell off the wagon at Calculus 104 and never made it to the cool stuff.

The book describes the origin of the theorem, and the consequent journey towards the proof. The proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians! However, this apparently innocuous theorem stimulated the development of number theory in mathematics. And it all started with Fermat's famous margin note ""I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.""Simon Singh has described it all beautifully, in a simple but attractive, exemplifying every new concept. I would not recommended this book to anyone who hasn't at least done maths till high school, simply because even though the book is written in simplified terms, only someone who loves maths would truly enjoy the book.

The book also included the actual proofs in the appendix (for the simple ones) and at least bothered to name-drop technical terms (so I could research them) before going on to simplify them for the casual reader.During certain parts, it felt like things were being over-simplified and getting repetitive, but those are minor grievances I'm willing to overlook.The book's inspiring and _tons_ of fun if you're even a little interested in Math! :D"

A lot of the actual maths baffled me a bit, but they're not the main point of this book.Rather, it shows the single minded obsession that someone can have as they try and solve something that possibly only a few others could.The book is well written and has an interesting story behind it, with tension rising in the last few chapters.

It tells the full “story of a riddle that confounded the world's greatest minds for 358 years” — until mathematician Andrew Wiles found a proof in 1993 to a problem formulated centuries earlier by the infamous riddler Pierre de Fermat. Wiles followed his childhood dream and after establishing himself in the academia he worked for years in total secrecy to find a solution to a problem that was by many already considered unbreakable. Singh did a superb job to introduce readers to the long history of Fermat's theorem and dropped enough breadcrumbs for anyone with basic understanding of high school math to follow the developing mystery from its inception to its final stages, establishing Wiles as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.

Fermat's last theorem that has baffled mathematicians from last 300 years was finally solved by Andrew Wiles in the 90s, but the proof, which creatively uses the best of traditional and twentieth century mathematical advances, is difficult to understand for the general reader. Singh tackles the problem by clearly explaining basics to keep the reader interested and invests pages over pages in curious sketches of mathematicians who spent their lives around the proof.

When we asked him how it was proven, we were told our level was too poor to understand (That’s the beauty of the French school system: teachers are very honest.).I read Simon Singh’s book 17 years later and I am glad to have at last an approximate idea of the theorem’s demonstration.

Based on recommendations from two people, I jumped into Simon Singh’s book on Fermat’s Last Theorem.Singh is a fantastic writer. His writing is lucid and fluid: never too many words, but also never too few. I enjoyed the mathematical background (and enjoyed working through the appendices), historical tidbits, how mathematicians work and the actual story of Wiles’s approach to the proof. It was a detective story with a touch of romance and history to it. It was exciting as each piece of the puzzle came together. I knew the ending and I still couldn’t wait to work through each page!I enjoyed the history that Singh provided, from the classical Greek mathematic Pythagorus, up through the centuries to Fermat and then to the present. This was a lovely romp through my two true academic loves: mathematics and classical studies. I was happy that he incorporated the story of female mathematicians into his narrative, something I didn’t know and that rarely pops up in general discussion of great mathematicians. Also, I enjoyed the chapter devoted to Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura, and their conjecture that sought to equate modular forms with elliptic equations. This conjecture was the ultimate lever that Wiles used to prove Fermat’s theorem.Singh also builds a strong case for pure research, even into seemingly unimportant topics. Fermat’s theorem was a cool idea, but on its own, it really didn’t seem that crucial. Yet the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, and the follow on work by Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet, tied a solution to something that would unite disparate parts of very important contemporary mathematics. Fermat provided the motivation, originally by accident, to improving modern mathematics. Wiles said “the definition of a good mathematical problem is the mathematics it generates rather than the problem itself” (p. 163).As for Wiles, he did amazing work and fulfilled his childhood dream. The book ends with a quote from him that I take to heart: “I had this very rare privilege of being able to pursue in my adult life what had been my childhood dream. I know it’s a rare privilege, but if you can tackle something in adult life that means that much to you then it’s more rewarding than anything imaginable” (p. 285).My problem with Wiles is that his success was due to other people doing what he refused to do. I think Singh implies it occasionally. Wiles succeeded because he was able to look at the work and ideas that other mathematics published. Taniyama, Shimura, Frey, Ribet and others had interesting insights directly or indirectly related to Fermat’s Last Theorem. They could have kept those ideas secret, like Wiles did. But, that would have slowed, or possibly stopped him in his tracks. He kept his task secret for seven years, even going so far as to publish unrelated work to throw people ‘off the scent.’ I know this was his lifelong dream and he wanted to solve it on his own. But, mathematical progress seems fastest when ideas are put out into the community and others can add their points of view. This isn’t meant diminish Wiles’s intellect or accomplishment, but it makes me wonder if Fermat’s theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture could have been proved sooner. Most mathematicians, including Wiles, seemingly went into mathematics due to the beauty of the system, rather than for money or glory.I highly recommend this book to everyone, from people with no interest in math up to PhD’s at the top of the field.

347,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27525841-lyle-regenwetter,4,"Fermat's Enigma is the first nonfiction book I have read in a while, and it exceeded my initially non-optimistic expectations in several ways. This book discusses Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous mathematical problems ever known to man. x^2+y^2=z^2 is a very familiar problem, appears frequently in mathematics, including in the Pythagorean Theorem for the relationship of Side Lengths of Right triangles. x^3+y^3=z^3 is a very similar problem, except for the fact that there are no real solutions. Furthermore, the proof remained a mystery to mathematicians for decades. How could such a deceptively simple problem be so difficult to solve? Contrary to my initial expectations, Fermat's Enigma focused less on the mathematics and more on the story of the quest of mathematicians to find the proof. The Author, Singh, did a fabulous job of making this boring story of a handful of lonely mathematicians into a story that actually interested me. As I said, my expectations were low going into this book. I was expecting a rather boring read, just something to read until I could find something more interesting, in fact. Although far from being action-packed, Fermat's Enigma kept me entertained in my free time for a few days. For those intimidated by mathematics, especially this unsolvably difficult problem, not to worry: Singh made this book very easy to comprehend. I had no trouble understanding the mathematical details incorporated into the plot, and I am sure the majority of readers could do the same. Before reading this book, in fact, I had already watched a documentary outlining he more technical mathematical aspects of the proof, which was in fact, related to another unsolved mathematical problem. The less technical nature of the book suited my interests nicely, because I got an interesting story out of this book, instead of a repetition of material that I am already familiar with. Consequently, I give this book 4 stars because, although not as exciting as I would have preferred, this book exceeded expectations and gave me a good read that I could think about in my spare time. In my opinion, this book gave a perfect amount of mathematical detail so that the average reader would be able to comprehend, but not see right through the mathematics. In addition, the average reader would most definitely take away some mathematical knowledge that they could apply to some things, or at least be able to discuss with or entertain a friend. This book was written in a similar style to The Code Book, also by Simon Singh. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a nonfiction book and put in a little bit of brainpower while reading. This is a great opportunity to experience the challenges and the research of the modern-day mathematician."
348,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"I wish I'd learned mathematics the way this book is written.The essence of mathematics and its complex theorems are explained in such simple, captivating and logical terms that even a non-Mathematician can easily comprehend. The book is about how a theorem developed by an amateur mathematician Fermat was successfully proved after hundreds of years. The theorem itself is very simple: No three positive integers satisfy the equation below when n is greater than 2.X^n + Y^n = Z^n This equation is similar to Pythagorean theorem (in fact, the Pythagorean theorem is the specific case of Fermat's last theorem in which n is equal 2). We know from our middle school math class that solutions exist in that case; in fact, sides of a right angle triangle can be expressed by this equation when n is equal to 2. And yet, when n=3 or above no integer solution exists. Fermat, himself, did not provide proof for his theorem, simply stating that he had no space to write down the solution of this problem. Whether he indeed proved his theorem or not is still debatable, but as far as we know, it took mathematicians all over the world for over three hundred years to prove his theorem. Rumor has it that the actual proof is over a hundred pages!The book is full of examples of how countless mathematicians ""wasted"" their entire lives to find the solution to this problem. One of the most heartbreaking stories is definitely the story of a Japanese mathematician Taniyama who committed suicide leaving a suicide note stating how tired he was and that he lost confidence in his future. Although largely criticized for his work during his lifetime, his conjecture has been a vital part in solving the Fermat's Last Theorem. It was heartbreaking but invigorating at times to learn about the lives of these mathematicians and how dedicated and obsessive they were about doing mathematics. The book also mentions the death of Archimedes who was so engrossed in his mathematical study that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman Soldier during the War and was speared to death. Although not many people would like the idea of being obsessed with something so deeply that it results in their own death, I wish I had that obsession - something that I could die for. They say ""Find what you love and let it kill you"". To say that it is the most ideal death may not be an exaggeration after reading this book :POverall, this book is highly recommended for scientists or mathematicians or simply anyone who needs some inspiration to get involved in academia."
349,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42757570-chaitanya-sethi,5,"What a fantastic book! I never could have imagined that one could write nearly 300 pages on a mathematical equation and make it genuinely exciting and fun to read! It really is the skill of the author to have built such a narrative around a topic that most people would overlook as something dull and uninteresting.Mathematics and mathematicians are both reputed to be dry and even intimidating, but this book does a brilliant job of changing that image. I had always enjoyed mathematics in school but had never ventured into the lives of the people who were responsible for the theorems and postulates that I would mindlessly apply. I really thank Simon for adding colour to their lives. In my head, most of them were indistinguishable from one another, and somehow, I would always assume them to be socially awkward, brooding people. Thank you for turning this silly stereotype of mine on its head. I can finally appreciate what Pythagoras did in his time (IMO his secret school called the Semicircle of Pythagoras, is the coolest cult/group name ever!), how tragically his life ended due to the political scenario during that time, I can admire Euclid's sass when he expelled a student when the student asked him the ""practical application"" of the education (but not before asking his slave to give the student a coin to send him off), I can think over the tragic life of Galois, who died, at the age of 20, shrouded in mystery of what he could have been, and most importantly I can think over the women mathematicians, who braved social discrimination and prejudice to still contribute to Fermat's problem and mathematics in general.While the story ends at the eventual discovery of the proof by Andrew Wiles, it meanders effortlessly through centuries and builds a narrative that enables one to understand what achievements took place before Fermat's time, how Fermat's eccentricities and his ever so popular Last Theorem was an annoyance to all, and finally what developments over the last few centuries enabled Wiley to claim his stake upon the problem. Alongside this, the author adds tidbits in the Appendix to keep it fun throughout.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is positively wonderful."

So, when I picked this one up I thought, ""Well, it's probably more of the same, but it's popular enough I should really add it to my repertoire."" Way wrong thought. Not only does this book contain even more charming mathematical anecdotes than I'd ever read before, but it also contains better written versions of the stories I'd heard of. For example, I knew about Sophie Germain, but I didn't know she'd saved Gauss' life. I knew all about the burning of Alexandria, but I didn't know it was Mark Antony who attempted to rebuild the great library. I knew Galois died young in a duel, but I never knew the full story.I read The Code Book in high school, and I remember it being good, but in a recreational way. It piqued my interest but I didn't really shelf it with ""high literature"" like I did with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid or Music of the Spheres: The Material Universe From Atom to Quaser, Simply Explained. It was enough for me, a young geeky teenager, to have a little fun playing with codes, then move on to another book. I am very happy that I returned to Singh, and I can confidently say this is the better of the two I've read. Mathematicians sure are a romantic lot."
351,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27336185-kenny,3," I'm not a maths person. I pretty much hated it at school, and pulled myself through somehow. So I was reading this as I was much more interested in the story of solving a problem that confounded the finest minds in maths for 300 years. It's based on the comment in the margins of a text from 17th century maths-genius/possibly most frustrating man in history Pierre de Fermat. A concept so simple even I could understand it (I can't do formula, here or anywhere but An +Bn =Cn can never be a whole number for any value of A and B above 2). Fermat posed this, and in 1637 scribbled he'd solved it, and promptly snuffed it. Inconsiderate really, as for the next 350 years no one could work it out, and many tried. Until Andrew Wiles did (just 15 years before the 200 year period to claim a prize for solving it ran out too.And that's basically the book. Singh covers a lot of complicated maths in this but does so well. There are passages that get into this, but as someone more interested in the human story than advanced theoretical maths, I found they were explained for the interested reader, but a full understanding wasn't essential to enjoy the telling of the tale. As Wiles' solution was based on solving and/or bringing together a number of other theorists work, this is a bit of a flythrough of a lot of complicated maths that while brain-melting, is also impressively interesting. Singh obviously had access to Wiles - who gave the story of how he did it, and which seems to be (perhaps characteristically) shorn of much of his emotions. A fascinating story, accessibly told."
352,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65863-elizabeth,5,"Fermat's Last Theorem is simple enough that anyone who understands Pythagorus' technique for finding the longest side of a right-angled triangle, can understand the conjecture that Fermat provides:a^n + b^n = c^n has no solutions in positive integers, if n is an integer greater than 2What is not easily understood is the story of how it was proved some 350 years later, but Simon Singh turns this story, over three-hundred years of mathematics, into a manageable and thrilling (yes thrilling!) read. The history of the theorem is in part the history of mathematics, and so in a way the history of how we understand the world. Singh boldly takes us from 350 BC to the 20th Century, explaining mathematical theory in plain intelligible English. He is not afraid to segue either into other interesting parts of history that his mathematicians lived through, so we see the burning of the Alexandrian Library, the French Revolution and the development of computing at Bletchley Park. Through Sophie Germain he investigates the role of female mathematicians in history and how they fought to be taught in the universities and be taken seriously. The concluded chapters describes Andrew Wiles's eight-year tackling of the proof reads more like a spy novel (in the best possible way) than a book on mathematics, a testament to Singh's skill at making what might be thought a dry subject one of intrigue and excitement.It is a startling and fascinating read from start to finish.

353,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27705356-nidhi-gupta,5,"What an incredibly inspiring book!! My husband gifted this book to me in 2008, with a note ""We'll let our dreams guide us forever"". Though his note kept beckoning me to read the book, the book's rather heavy title kept me away from picking it up (even though my favorite subject in high-school was Math). Now that I've read the book, I realize how misguided my apprehension was. Simon Singh weaves such a wonderful tale of intrigue, passion, gossip, heartbreak, and persistence that surrounded the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem - the puzzle that baffled the finest mathematical brains for over 350 years. Although Fermat claimed that he had a proof of the Theorem, he did not write down this proof anywhere. Fermat's claim mocked at mathematicians for over three centuries some of whom(both men and women) invested their careers in trying to solve this rather simple looking problem.Without making any technical detail sound laborious, Singh beautifully takes us through the journey of many mathematicians who in one way or the other contributed to the epic quest to prove Fermat's Theorem. In particular, it tells us of the pursuits of one particular mathematician - Andrew Wiles - who got interested in the Theorem as a child and dedicated his career to realizing his dream of proving it. Another thing about the book that demands great merit is the comprehensible-to-layman style of writing that the author employs to tackle such a technical topic. I highly recommend this book and will definitely read other books by Simon Singh. "

Curiously, for all higher powers, there is no solution - and no proof of there being no solution either. And it remained unsolved for 350 years.We follow the progress made by stalwarts such as Euler, Fermat himself, Taniyama and Shimura among others along with delightful snippets of their lives, times and methods. The structure of pure mathematics and number theory is adequately explained along with its modern applications - especially in computing and cryptography (laymen read digital signatures). Also, please note that if you read popular science, you will not face any problems in reading this as the algebra is minimal. Also, if I can read Dawkins's books on evolution, others can easily read this :POnly problem is that I think modular forms were not adequately explained. I hope this will be corrected in future editions. This book was in my to-read list for some time but finally got around to picking it up as it was also in the selection of my recreational club's library - and they really have great taste.

355,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Great (4.5)--Although I would've appreciated a little more concrete math, Simon Singh does another superb job at explaining in lay terms what Fermat's Last Theorem meant for mathematics at large and what Andrew Wiles achieved in proving it after 350 years of numerous failures by other greatest minds of their times. It's a fascinating history whose intensity and influence can't be gleaned from just reading the theorem, which states simply:For n greater than 2, there is no whole number solution for the equation:x^(n)+y^(n)=z^(n).As simple as that. But the stories of the greatest mathematical geniuses who tried and failed in proving this theorem are so packed with tragedies, despairs, flashes of immense creativity, and human dramas that it's just a great topic to be treated in a book. Andrew Wiles's passion and sheer obsession with this theorem is moving and inspirational. How could anyone spend thirty years on a single problem when there were doubts even about the existence of a solution? Thirty years. I reel at the thought of it, and feel immense admiration for a man who kept his faith and followed his passion to the very end.Great story."

The actual proof manuscript by Andrew Wiles is 200 pages long and consists of beautiful blend of mathematical concepts with modern mathematics. Simon Singh has very beautifully explained the various approaches and attempts made to prove this theorem by mathematicians for over 350 years. She has step by step taken the reader to the times preceding the Fermat's time, to the time of Pythagoras, wherein lies the roots of this theorem. In this process she has taken us through brief life, time and works of various mathematicians whose work proved valuable in order for Andrew Wiles to proof this theorem.The book is written in a very interesting and catching style and surprisingly does not include any complex mathematics. And hence a person with basic high school understanding of mathematics can understand and grasp the concepts in this book.A must read for any mathematics fan."
357,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53101848-annabeth,4,"Good book for people who aren't math experts, but a little interested in the topic.It gives an insight not only on Fermat, his last theorem and Andrew Wiles, who eventually proved it, but also the lives of many great mathematicians before and after Fermat, their failed attempts to prove what can be considered THE THEOREM that lead to many important mathematical discoveries. It is truly remarkable - almost every mathematician of the 18th and 19th century tried to solve the problem, some were fascinated, some obsessed, and some devoted their entire lives and careers to it - until the last of them, Andrew Wiles, finally succeeded.Everyone who says math is boring has clearly never experienced the determination when you r e a l l y want to solve a problem, the despair and frustration when you rack your brain for weeks, months, or in this case, years, but can't find a solution and the joy when you finally accomplish it. This is what this book is really about. And it's educational but not too hard to understand at the same time - what more can you ask for. One of the best books about maths for non-mathematicians."
358,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65913-tim,4,"More first-rate science writing from Simon Singh. In this case he seems to have got in on the ground floor of the biggest mathematical discovery of the century -- the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994. Were it only for the reporting alone it would be worth a read, but Singh also does a creditable job of actually, you know, explaining the math. Unintimidated by Stephen Hawking's dictum that each equation reduces your sales by half, he succeeds by going big, delving as deep as he dares into the strategies of the many failed stabs at a proof, as well as Wiles' final triumph. I especially appreciated that Singh didn't shy away from the thorny abstraction of 20th century math, such as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture at the heart of the proof. A great many popular books will touch on Pythagoras and Euclid, Gauss and Germain, Hilbert and Gödel, but it's rare to read about more recent work, much less predictions for the future of mathematics (probably because it is all quite difficult and hasn't yet filtered into the public understanding)."

I love learning how math works if I don’t have to actually sit there and do the tedious work of adding and multiplying, so I really enjoyed reading about the different mathematicians who contributed to the problem’s solution, and the proofs and breakthroughs that advanced the study of math along the way. Plus the problem was finally solved by a Princeton professor, so, school pride! Not that I can really claim any personal connection to the math department, seeing as how I fell off the wagon at Calculus 104 and never made it to the cool stuff.

The book describes the origin of the theorem, and the consequent journey towards the proof. The proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians! However, this apparently innocuous theorem stimulated the development of number theory in mathematics. And it all started with Fermat's famous margin note ""I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.""Simon Singh has described it all beautifully, in a simple but attractive, exemplifying every new concept. I would not recommended this book to anyone who hasn't at least done maths till high school, simply because even though the book is written in simplified terms, only someone who loves maths would truly enjoy the book.

The book also included the actual proofs in the appendix (for the simple ones) and at least bothered to name-drop technical terms (so I could research them) before going on to simplify them for the casual reader.During certain parts, it felt like things were being over-simplified and getting repetitive, but those are minor grievances I'm willing to overlook.The book's inspiring and _tons_ of fun if you're even a little interested in Math! :D"

A lot of the actual maths baffled me a bit, but they're not the main point of this book.Rather, it shows the single minded obsession that someone can have as they try and solve something that possibly only a few others could.The book is well written and has an interesting story behind it, with tension rising in the last few chapters.

It tells the full “story of a riddle that confounded the world's greatest minds for 358 years” — until mathematician Andrew Wiles found a proof in 1993 to a problem formulated centuries earlier by the infamous riddler Pierre de Fermat. Wiles followed his childhood dream and after establishing himself in the academia he worked for years in total secrecy to find a solution to a problem that was by many already considered unbreakable. Singh did a superb job to introduce readers to the long history of Fermat's theorem and dropped enough breadcrumbs for anyone with basic understanding of high school math to follow the developing mystery from its inception to its final stages, establishing Wiles as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.

Fermat's last theorem that has baffled mathematicians from last 300 years was finally solved by Andrew Wiles in the 90s, but the proof, which creatively uses the best of traditional and twentieth century mathematical advances, is difficult to understand for the general reader. Singh tackles the problem by clearly explaining basics to keep the reader interested and invests pages over pages in curious sketches of mathematicians who spent their lives around the proof.

375,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63402364-vrushali,5,Developing reader's interest in the story of how the greatest mathematical puzzle of all time was solved is a mark of exceptional writing by Simon Singh. Truly remarkable !!
376,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1752430-drew,5,"I remember sitting in an office with a friend and downloading his proof when it was published. I had a small background in abstract algebra and I was able to get through a few pages, but then became utterly lost. I was still enthralled and flipped through it like it was a gift for my birthday! Based on recommendations from two people, I jumped into Simon Singh’s book on Fermat’s Last Theorem.Singh is a fantastic writer. His writing is lucid and fluid: never too many words, but also never too few. I enjoyed the mathematical background (and enjoyed working through the appendices), historical tidbits, how mathematicians work and the actual story of Wiles’s approach to the proof. It was a detective story with a touch of romance and history to it. It was exciting as each piece of the puzzle came together. I knew the ending and I still couldn’t wait to work through each page!I enjoyed the history that Singh provided, from the classical Greek mathematic Pythagorus, up through the centuries to Fermat and then to the present. This was a lovely romp through my two true academic loves: mathematics and classical studies. I was happy that he incorporated the story of female mathematicians into his narrative, something I didn’t know and that rarely pops up in general discussion of great mathematicians. Also, I enjoyed the chapter devoted to Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura, and their conjecture that sought to equate modular forms with elliptic equations. This conjecture was the ultimate lever that Wiles used to prove Fermat’s theorem.Singh also builds a strong case for pure research, even into seemingly unimportant topics. Fermat’s theorem was a cool idea, but on its own, it really didn’t seem that crucial. Yet the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, and the follow on work by Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet, tied a solution to something that would unite disparate parts of very important contemporary mathematics. Fermat provided the motivation, originally by accident, to improving modern mathematics. Wiles said “the definition of a good mathematical problem is the mathematics it generates rather than the problem itself” (p. 163).As for Wiles, he did amazing work and fulfilled his childhood dream. The book ends with a quote from him that I take to heart: “I had this very rare privilege of being able to pursue in my adult life what had been my childhood dream. I know it’s a rare privilege, but if you can tackle something in adult life that means that much to you then it’s more rewarding than anything imaginable” (p. 285).My problem with Wiles is that his success was due to other people doing what he refused to do. I think Singh implies it occasionally. Wiles succeeded because he was able to look at the work and ideas that other mathematics published. Taniyama, Shimura, Frey, Ribet and others had interesting insights directly or indirectly related to Fermat’s Last Theorem. They could have kept those ideas secret, like Wiles did. But, that would have slowed, or possibly stopped him in his tracks. He kept his task secret for seven years, even going so far as to publish unrelated work to throw people ‘off the scent.’ I know this was his lifelong dream and he wanted to solve it on his own. But, mathematical progress seems fastest when ideas are put out into the community and others can add their points of view. This isn’t meant diminish Wiles’s intellect or accomplishment, but it makes me wonder if Fermat’s theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture could have been proved sooner. Most mathematicians, including Wiles, seemingly went into mathematics due to the beauty of the system, rather than for money or glory.I highly recommend this book to everyone, from people with no interest in math up to PhD’s at the top of the field.

377,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27525841-lyle-regenwetter,4,"Fermat's Enigma is the first nonfiction book I have read in a while, and it exceeded my initially non-optimistic expectations in several ways. This book discusses Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous mathematical problems ever known to man. x^2+y^2=z^2 is a very familiar problem, appears frequently in mathematics, including in the Pythagorean Theorem for the relationship of Side Lengths of Right triangles. x^3+y^3=z^3 is a very similar problem, except for the fact that there are no real solutions. Furthermore, the proof remained a mystery to mathematicians for decades. How could such a deceptively simple problem be so difficult to solve? Contrary to my initial expectations, Fermat's Enigma focused less on the mathematics and more on the story of the quest of mathematicians to find the proof. The Author, Singh, did a fabulous job of making this boring story of a handful of lonely mathematicians into a story that actually interested me. As I said, my expectations were low going into this book. I was expecting a rather boring read, just something to read until I could find something more interesting, in fact. Although far from being action-packed, Fermat's Enigma kept me entertained in my free time for a few days. For those intimidated by mathematics, especially this unsolvably difficult problem, not to worry: Singh made this book very easy to comprehend. I had no trouble understanding the mathematical details incorporated into the plot, and I am sure the majority of readers could do the same. Before reading this book, in fact, I had already watched a documentary outlining he more technical mathematical aspects of the proof, which was in fact, related to another unsolved mathematical problem. The less technical nature of the book suited my interests nicely, because I got an interesting story out of this book, instead of a repetition of material that I am already familiar with. Consequently, I give this book 4 stars because, although not as exciting as I would have preferred, this book exceeded expectations and gave me a good read that I could think about in my spare time. In my opinion, this book gave a perfect amount of mathematical detail so that the average reader would be able to comprehend, but not see right through the mathematics. In addition, the average reader would most definitely take away some mathematical knowledge that they could apply to some things, or at least be able to discuss with or entertain a friend. This book was written in a similar style to The Code Book, also by Simon Singh. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a nonfiction book and put in a little bit of brainpower while reading. This is a great opportunity to experience the challenges and the research of the modern-day mathematician."
378,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"I wish I'd learned mathematics the way this book is written.The essence of mathematics and its complex theorems are explained in such simple, captivating and logical terms that even a non-Mathematician can easily comprehend. The book is about how a theorem developed by an amateur mathematician Fermat was successfully proved after hundreds of years. The theorem itself is very simple: No three positive integers satisfy the equation below when n is greater than 2.X^n + Y^n = Z^n This equation is similar to Pythagorean theorem (in fact, the Pythagorean theorem is the specific case of Fermat's last theorem in which n is equal 2). We know from our middle school math class that solutions exist in that case; in fact, sides of a right angle triangle can be expressed by this equation when n is equal to 2. And yet, when n=3 or above no integer solution exists. Fermat, himself, did not provide proof for his theorem, simply stating that he had no space to write down the solution of this problem. Whether he indeed proved his theorem or not is still debatable, but as far as we know, it took mathematicians all over the world for over three hundred years to prove his theorem. Rumor has it that the actual proof is over a hundred pages!The book is full of examples of how countless mathematicians ""wasted"" their entire lives to find the solution to this problem. One of the most heartbreaking stories is definitely the story of a Japanese mathematician Taniyama who committed suicide leaving a suicide note stating how tired he was and that he lost confidence in his future. Although largely criticized for his work during his lifetime, his conjecture has been a vital part in solving the Fermat's Last Theorem. It was heartbreaking but invigorating at times to learn about the lives of these mathematicians and how dedicated and obsessive they were about doing mathematics. The book also mentions the death of Archimedes who was so engrossed in his mathematical study that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman Soldier during the War and was speared to death. Although not many people would like the idea of being obsessed with something so deeply that it results in their own death, I wish I had that obsession - something that I could die for. They say ""Find what you love and let it kill you"". To say that it is the most ideal death may not be an exaggeration after reading this book :POverall, this book is highly recommended for scientists or mathematicians or simply anyone who needs some inspiration to get involved in academia."
379,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42757570-chaitanya-sethi,5,"What a fantastic book! I never could have imagined that one could write nearly 300 pages on a mathematical equation and make it genuinely exciting and fun to read! It really is the skill of the author to have built such a narrative around a topic that most people would overlook as something dull and uninteresting.Mathematics and mathematicians are both reputed to be dry and even intimidating, but this book does a brilliant job of changing that image. I had always enjoyed mathematics in school but had never ventured into the lives of the people who were responsible for the theorems and postulates that I would mindlessly apply. I really thank Simon for adding colour to their lives. In my head, most of them were indistinguishable from one another, and somehow, I would always assume them to be socially awkward, brooding people. Thank you for turning this silly stereotype of mine on its head. I can finally appreciate what Pythagoras did in his time (IMO his secret school called the Semicircle of Pythagoras, is the coolest cult/group name ever!), how tragically his life ended due to the political scenario during that time, I can admire Euclid's sass when he expelled a student when the student asked him the ""practical application"" of the education (but not before asking his slave to give the student a coin to send him off), I can think over the tragic life of Galois, who died, at the age of 20, shrouded in mystery of what he could have been, and most importantly I can think over the women mathematicians, who braved social discrimination and prejudice to still contribute to Fermat's problem and mathematics in general.While the story ends at the eventual discovery of the proof by Andrew Wiles, it meanders effortlessly through centuries and builds a narrative that enables one to understand what achievements took place before Fermat's time, how Fermat's eccentricities and his ever so popular Last Theorem was an annoyance to all, and finally what developments over the last few centuries enabled Wiley to claim his stake upon the problem. Alongside this, the author adds tidbits in the Appendix to keep it fun throughout.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is positively wonderful."
380,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31656053-victor-davis,5,"I am blown away by this book. I've read so many nonfiction math and physics books that they were starting to repeat themselves. So, when I picked this one up I thought, ""Well, it's probably more of the same, but it's popular enough I should really add it to my repertoire."" Way wrong thought. Not only does this book contain even more charming mathematical anecdotes than I'd ever read before, but it also contains better written versions of the stories I'd heard of. For example, I knew about Sophie Germain, but I didn't know she'd saved Gauss' life. I knew all about the burning of Alexandria, but I didn't know it was Mark Antony who attempted to rebuild the great library. I knew Galois died young in a duel, but I never knew the full story.I read The Code Book in high school, and I remember it being good, but in a recreational way. It piqued my interest but I didn't really shelf it with ""high literature"" like I did with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid or Music of the Spheres: The Material Universe From Atom to Quaser, Simply Explained. It was enough for me, a young geeky teenager, to have a little fun playing with codes, then move on to another book. I am very happy that I returned to Singh, and I can confidently say this is the better of the two I've read. Mathematicians sure are a romantic lot."
381,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27336185-kenny,3," I'm not a maths person. I pretty much hated it at school, and pulled myself through somehow. So I was reading this as I was much more interested in the story of solving a problem that confounded the finest minds in maths for 300 years. It's based on the comment in the margins of a text from 17th century maths-genius/possibly most frustrating man in history Pierre de Fermat. A concept so simple even I could understand it (I can't do formula, here or anywhere but An +Bn =Cn can never be a whole number for any value of A and B above 2). Fermat posed this, and in 1637 scribbled he'd solved it, and promptly snuffed it. Inconsiderate really, as for the next 350 years no one could work it out, and many tried. Until Andrew Wiles did (just 15 years before the 200 year period to claim a prize for solving it ran out too.And that's basically the book. Singh covers a lot of complicated maths in this but does so well. There are passages that get into this, but as someone more interested in the human story than advanced theoretical maths, I found they were explained for the interested reader, but a full understanding wasn't essential to enjoy the telling of the tale. As Wiles' solution was based on solving and/or bringing together a number of other theorists work, this is a bit of a flythrough of a lot of complicated maths that while brain-melting, is also impressively interesting. Singh obviously had access to Wiles - who gave the story of how he did it, and which seems to be (perhaps characteristically) shorn of much of his emotions. A fascinating story, accessibly told."
382,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65863-elizabeth,5,"Fermat's Last Theorem is simple enough that anyone who understands Pythagorus' technique for finding the longest side of a right-angled triangle, can understand the conjecture that Fermat provides:a^n + b^n = c^n has no solutions in positive integers, if n is an integer greater than 2What is not easily understood is the story of how it was proved some 350 years later, but Simon Singh turns this story, over three-hundred years of mathematics, into a manageable and thrilling (yes thrilling!) read. The history of the theorem is in part the history of mathematics, and so in a way the history of how we understand the world. Singh boldly takes us from 350 BC to the 20th Century, explaining mathematical theory in plain intelligible English. He is not afraid to segue either into other interesting parts of history that his mathematicians lived through, so we see the burning of the Alexandrian Library, the French Revolution and the development of computing at Bletchley Park. Through Sophie Germain he investigates the role of female mathematicians in history and how they fought to be taught in the universities and be taken seriously. The concluded chapters describes Andrew Wiles's eight-year tackling of the proof reads more like a spy novel (in the best possible way) than a book on mathematics, a testament to Singh's skill at making what might be thought a dry subject one of intrigue and excitement.It is a startling and fascinating read from start to finish. "
383,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27705356-nidhi-gupta,5,"What an incredibly inspiring book!! My husband gifted this book to me in 2008, with a note ""We'll let our dreams guide us forever"". Though his note kept beckoning me to read the book, the book's rather heavy title kept me away from picking it up (even though my favorite subject in high-school was Math). Now that I've read the book, I realize how misguided my apprehension was. Simon Singh weaves such a wonderful tale of intrigue, passion, gossip, heartbreak, and persistence that surrounded the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem - the puzzle that baffled the finest mathematical brains for over 350 years. Although Fermat claimed that he had a proof of the Theorem, he did not write down this proof anywhere. Fermat's claim mocked at mathematicians for over three centuries some of whom(both men and women) invested their careers in trying to solve this rather simple looking problem.Without making any technical detail sound laborious, Singh beautifully takes us through the journey of many mathematicians who in one way or the other contributed to the epic quest to prove Fermat's Theorem. In particular, it tells us of the pursuits of one particular mathematician - Andrew Wiles - who got interested in the Theorem as a child and dedicated his career to realizing his dream of proving it. Another thing about the book that demands great merit is the comprehensible-to-layman style of writing that the author employs to tackle such a technical topic. I highly recommend this book and will definitely read other books by Simon Singh. "

Curiously, for all higher powers, there is no solution - and no proof of there being no solution either. And it remained unsolved for 350 years.We follow the progress made by stalwarts such as Euler, Fermat himself, Taniyama and Shimura among others along with delightful snippets of their lives, times and methods. The structure of pure mathematics and number theory is adequately explained along with its modern applications - especially in computing and cryptography (laymen read digital signatures). Also, please note that if you read popular science, you will not face any problems in reading this as the algebra is minimal. Also, if I can read Dawkins's books on evolution, others can easily read this :POnly problem is that I think modular forms were not adequately explained. I hope this will be corrected in future editions. This book was in my to-read list for some time but finally got around to picking it up as it was also in the selection of my recreational club's library - and they really have great taste.

385,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Great (4.5)--Although I would've appreciated a little more concrete math, Simon Singh does another superb job at explaining in lay terms what Fermat's Last Theorem meant for mathematics at large and what Andrew Wiles achieved in proving it after 350 years of numerous failures by other greatest minds of their times. It's a fascinating history whose intensity and influence can't be gleaned from just reading the theorem, which states simply:For n greater than 2, there is no whole number solution for the equation:x^(n)+y^(n)=z^(n).As simple as that. But the stories of the greatest mathematical geniuses who tried and failed in proving this theorem are so packed with tragedies, despairs, flashes of immense creativity, and human dramas that it's just a great topic to be treated in a book. Andrew Wiles's passion and sheer obsession with this theorem is moving and inspirational. How could anyone spend thirty years on a single problem when there were doubts even about the existence of a solution? Thirty years. I reel at the thought of it, and feel immense admiration for a man who kept his faith and followed his passion to the very end.Great story."

The actual proof manuscript by Andrew Wiles is 200 pages long and consists of beautiful blend of mathematical concepts with modern mathematics. Simon Singh has very beautifully explained the various approaches and attempts made to prove this theorem by mathematicians for over 350 years. She has step by step taken the reader to the times preceding the Fermat's time, to the time of Pythagoras, wherein lies the roots of this theorem. In this process she has taken us through brief life, time and works of various mathematicians whose work proved valuable in order for Andrew Wiles to proof this theorem.The book is written in a very interesting and catching style and surprisingly does not include any complex mathematics. And hence a person with basic high school understanding of mathematics can understand and grasp the concepts in this book.A must read for any mathematics fan."
387,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53101848-annabeth,4,"Good book for people who aren't math experts, but a little interested in the topic.It gives an insight not only on Fermat, his last theorem and Andrew Wiles, who eventually proved it, but also the lives of many great mathematicians before and after Fermat, their failed attempts to prove what can be considered THE THEOREM that lead to many important mathematical discoveries. It is truly remarkable - almost every mathematician of the 18th and 19th century tried to solve the problem, some were fascinated, some obsessed, and some devoted their entire lives and careers to it - until the last of them, Andrew Wiles, finally succeeded.Everyone who says math is boring has clearly never experienced the determination when you r e a l l y want to solve a problem, the despair and frustration when you rack your brain for weeks, months, or in this case, years, but can't find a solution and the joy when you finally accomplish it. This is what this book is really about. And it's educational but not too hard to understand at the same time - what more can you ask for. One of the best books about maths for non-mathematicians."
388,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65913-tim,4,"More first-rate science writing from Simon Singh. In this case he seems to have got in on the ground floor of the biggest mathematical discovery of the century -- the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994. Were it only for the reporting alone it would be worth a read, but Singh also does a creditable job of actually, you know, explaining the math. Unintimidated by Stephen Hawking's dictum that each equation reduces your sales by half, he succeeds by going big, delving as deep as he dares into the strategies of the many failed stabs at a proof, as well as Wiles' final triumph. I especially appreciated that Singh didn't shy away from the thorny abstraction of 20th century math, such as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture at the heart of the proof. A great many popular books will touch on Pythagoras and Euclid, Gauss and Germain, Hilbert and Gödel, but it's rare to read about more recent work, much less predictions for the future of mathematics (probably because it is all quite difficult and hasn't yet filtered into the public understanding)."

I love learning how math works if I don’t have to actually sit there and do the tedious work of adding and multiplying, so I really enjoyed reading about the different mathematicians who contributed to the problem’s solution, and the proofs and breakthroughs that advanced the study of math along the way. Plus the problem was finally solved by a Princeton professor, so, school pride! Not that I can really claim any personal connection to the math department, seeing as how I fell off the wagon at Calculus 104 and never made it to the cool stuff.

The book describes the origin of the theorem, and the consequent journey towards the proof. The proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians! However, this apparently innocuous theorem stimulated the development of number theory in mathematics. And it all started with Fermat's famous margin note ""I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.""Simon Singh has described it all beautifully, in a simple but attractive, exemplifying every new concept. I would not recommended this book to anyone who hasn't at least done maths till high school, simply because even though the book is written in simplified terms, only someone who loves maths would truly enjoy the book.

The book also included the actual proofs in the appendix (for the simple ones) and at least bothered to name-drop technical terms (so I could research them) before going on to simplify them for the casual reader.During certain parts, it felt like things were being over-simplified and getting repetitive, but those are minor grievances I'm willing to overlook.The book's inspiring and _tons_ of fun if you're even a little interested in Math! :D"

A lot of the actual maths baffled me a bit, but they're not the main point of this book.Rather, it shows the single minded obsession that someone can have as they try and solve something that possibly only a few others could.The book is well written and has an interesting story behind it, with tension rising in the last few chapters.

Wiles followed his childhood dream and after establishing himself in the academia he worked for years in total secrecy to find a solution to a problem that was by many already considered unbreakable. Singh did a superb job to introduce readers to the long history of Fermat's theorem and dropped enough breadcrumbs for anyone with basic understanding of high school math to follow the developing mystery from its inception to its final stages, establishing Wiles as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.

Singh tackles the problem by clearly explaining basics to keep the reader interested and invests pages over pages in curious sketches of mathematicians who spent their lives around the proof. Their mistakes, their tragedies, their triumphs all merge into a seamless narrative that ultimately rewards and inspires. The book has been described as a mathematical detective story, and one couldn't disagree."

It told a story that stayed interesting from beginning to end, and it didn't get bogged down in calculus or even more rarefied areas of mathematics. And I especially appreciated how the proofs for various propositions were included in a series of appendices instead of interrupting the text."

Of course, when the Fermat theorem was finally proven, it was a big deal for our teacher, who always suspected Fermat had bluffed and had never completed the demonstration. When we asked him how it was proven, we were told our level was too poor to understand (That’s the beauty of the French school system: teachers are very honest.).I read Simon Singh’s book 17 years later and I am glad to have at last an approximate idea of the theorem’s demonstration. I especially liked the chronological approach to the problem-solving steps, and I wish I had been told more about Math’s history at school. I thought Singh’s approach was very pedagogical."

406,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1752430-drew,5,"I remember sitting in an office with a friend and downloading his proof when it was published. I had a small background in abstract algebra and I was able to get through a few pages, but then became utterly lost. I was still enthralled and flipped through it like it was a gift for my birthday! Based on recommendations from two people, I jumped into Simon Singh’s book on Fermat’s Last Theorem.Singh is a fantastic writer. His writing is lucid and fluid: never too many words, but also never too few. I enjoyed the mathematical background (and enjoyed working through the appendices), historical tidbits, how mathematicians work and the actual story of Wiles’s approach to the proof. It was a detective story with a touch of romance and history to it. It was exciting as each piece of the puzzle came together. I knew the ending and I still couldn’t wait to work through each page!I enjoyed the history that Singh provided, from the classical Greek mathematic Pythagorus, up through the centuries to Fermat and then to the present. This was a lovely romp through my two true academic loves: mathematics and classical studies. I was happy that he incorporated the story of female mathematicians into his narrative, something I didn’t know and that rarely pops up in general discussion of great mathematicians. Also, I enjoyed the chapter devoted to Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura, and their conjecture that sought to equate modular forms with elliptic equations. This conjecture was the ultimate lever that Wiles used to prove Fermat’s theorem.Singh also builds a strong case for pure research, even into seemingly unimportant topics. Fermat’s theorem was a cool idea, but on its own, it really didn’t seem that crucial. Yet the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, and the follow on work by Gerhard Frey and Ken Ribet, tied a solution to something that would unite disparate parts of very important contemporary mathematics. Fermat provided the motivation, originally by accident, to improving modern mathematics. Wiles said “the definition of a good mathematical problem is the mathematics it generates rather than the problem itself” (p. 163).As for Wiles, he did amazing work and fulfilled his childhood dream. The book ends with a quote from him that I take to heart: “I had this very rare privilege of being able to pursue in my adult life what had been my childhood dream. I know it’s a rare privilege, but if you can tackle something in adult life that means that much to you then it’s more rewarding than anything imaginable” (p. 285).My problem with Wiles is that his success was due to other people doing what he refused to do. I think Singh implies it occasionally. Wiles succeeded because he was able to look at the work and ideas that other mathematics published. Taniyama, Shimura, Frey, Ribet and others had interesting insights directly or indirectly related to Fermat’s Last Theorem. They could have kept those ideas secret, like Wiles did. But, that would have slowed, or possibly stopped him in his tracks. He kept his task secret for seven years, even going so far as to publish unrelated work to throw people ‘off the scent.’ I know this was his lifelong dream and he wanted to solve it on his own. But, mathematical progress seems fastest when ideas are put out into the community and others can add their points of view. This isn’t meant diminish Wiles’s intellect or accomplishment, but it makes me wonder if Fermat’s theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture could have been proved sooner. Most mathematicians, including Wiles, seemingly went into mathematics due to the beauty of the system, rather than for money or glory.I highly recommend this book to everyone, from people with no interest in math up to PhD’s at the top of the field.

407,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27525841-lyle-regenwetter,4,"Fermat's Enigma is the first nonfiction book I have read in a while, and it exceeded my initially non-optimistic expectations in several ways. This book discusses Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous mathematical problems ever known to man. x^2+y^2=z^2 is a very familiar problem, appears frequently in mathematics, including in the Pythagorean Theorem for the relationship of Side Lengths of Right triangles. x^3+y^3=z^3 is a very similar problem, except for the fact that there are no real solutions. Furthermore, the proof remained a mystery to mathematicians for decades. How could such a deceptively simple problem be so difficult to solve? Contrary to my initial expectations, Fermat's Enigma focused less on the mathematics and more on the story of the quest of mathematicians to find the proof. The Author, Singh, did a fabulous job of making this boring story of a handful of lonely mathematicians into a story that actually interested me. As I said, my expectations were low going into this book. I was expecting a rather boring read, just something to read until I could find something more interesting, in fact. Although far from being action-packed, Fermat's Enigma kept me entertained in my free time for a few days. For those intimidated by mathematics, especially this unsolvably difficult problem, not to worry: Singh made this book very easy to comprehend. I had no trouble understanding the mathematical details incorporated into the plot, and I am sure the majority of readers could do the same. Before reading this book, in fact, I had already watched a documentary outlining he more technical mathematical aspects of the proof, which was in fact, related to another unsolved mathematical problem. The less technical nature of the book suited my interests nicely, because I got an interesting story out of this book, instead of a repetition of material that I am already familiar with. Consequently, I give this book 4 stars because, although not as exciting as I would have preferred, this book exceeded expectations and gave me a good read that I could think about in my spare time. In my opinion, this book gave a perfect amount of mathematical detail so that the average reader would be able to comprehend, but not see right through the mathematics. In addition, the average reader would most definitely take away some mathematical knowledge that they could apply to some things, or at least be able to discuss with or entertain a friend. This book was written in a similar style to The Code Book, also by Simon Singh. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a nonfiction book and put in a little bit of brainpower while reading. This is a great opportunity to experience the challenges and the research of the modern-day mathematician."
408,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"I wish I'd learned mathematics the way this book is written.The essence of mathematics and its complex theorems are explained in such simple, captivating and logical terms that even a non-Mathematician can easily comprehend. The book is about how a theorem developed by an amateur mathematician Fermat was successfully proved after hundreds of years. The theorem itself is very simple: No three positive integers satisfy the equation below when n is greater than 2.X^n + Y^n = Z^n This equation is similar to Pythagorean theorem (in fact, the Pythagorean theorem is the specific case of Fermat's last theorem in which n is equal 2). We know from our middle school math class that solutions exist in that case; in fact, sides of a right angle triangle can be expressed by this equation when n is equal to 2. And yet, when n=3 or above no integer solution exists. Fermat, himself, did not provide proof for his theorem, simply stating that he had no space to write down the solution of this problem. Whether he indeed proved his theorem or not is still debatable, but as far as we know, it took mathematicians all over the world for over three hundred years to prove his theorem. Rumor has it that the actual proof is over a hundred pages!The book is full of examples of how countless mathematicians ""wasted"" their entire lives to find the solution to this problem. One of the most heartbreaking stories is definitely the story of a Japanese mathematician Taniyama who committed suicide leaving a suicide note stating how tired he was and that he lost confidence in his future. Although largely criticized for his work during his lifetime, his conjecture has been a vital part in solving the Fermat's Last Theorem. It was heartbreaking but invigorating at times to learn about the lives of these mathematicians and how dedicated and obsessive they were about doing mathematics. The book also mentions the death of Archimedes who was so engrossed in his mathematical study that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman Soldier during the War and was speared to death. Although not many people would like the idea of being obsessed with something so deeply that it results in their own death, I wish I had that obsession - something that I could die for. They say ""Find what you love and let it kill you"". To say that it is the most ideal death may not be an exaggeration after reading this book :POverall, this book is highly recommended for scientists or mathematicians or simply anyone who needs some inspiration to get involved in academia."
409,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42757570-chaitanya-sethi,5,"What a fantastic book! I never could have imagined that one could write nearly 300 pages on a mathematical equation and make it genuinely exciting and fun to read! It really is the skill of the author to have built such a narrative around a topic that most people would overlook as something dull and uninteresting.Mathematics and mathematicians are both reputed to be dry and even intimidating, but this book does a brilliant job of changing that image. I had always enjoyed mathematics in school but had never ventured into the lives of the people who were responsible for the theorems and postulates that I would mindlessly apply. I really thank Simon for adding colour to their lives. In my head, most of them were indistinguishable from one another, and somehow, I would always assume them to be socially awkward, brooding people. Thank you for turning this silly stereotype of mine on its head. I can finally appreciate what Pythagoras did in his time (IMO his secret school called the Semicircle of Pythagoras, is the coolest cult/group name ever!), how tragically his life ended due to the political scenario during that time, I can admire Euclid's sass when he expelled a student when the student asked him the ""practical application"" of the education (but not before asking his slave to give the student a coin to send him off), I can think over the tragic life of Galois, who died, at the age of 20, shrouded in mystery of what he could have been, and most importantly I can think over the women mathematicians, who braved social discrimination and prejudice to still contribute to Fermat's problem and mathematics in general.While the story ends at the eventual discovery of the proof by Andrew Wiles, it meanders effortlessly through centuries and builds a narrative that enables one to understand what achievements took place before Fermat's time, how Fermat's eccentricities and his ever so popular Last Theorem was an annoyance to all, and finally what developments over the last few centuries enabled Wiley to claim his stake upon the problem. Alongside this, the author adds tidbits in the Appendix to keep it fun throughout.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is positively wonderful."
410,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31656053-victor-davis,5,"I am blown away by this book. I've read so many nonfiction math and physics books that they were starting to repeat themselves. So, when I picked this one up I thought, ""Well, it's probably more of the same, but it's popular enough I should really add it to my repertoire."" Way wrong thought. Not only does this book contain even more charming mathematical anecdotes than I'd ever read before, but it also contains better written versions of the stories I'd heard of. For example, I knew about Sophie Germain, but I didn't know she'd saved Gauss' life. I knew all about the burning of Alexandria, but I didn't know it was Mark Antony who attempted to rebuild the great library. I knew Galois died young in a duel, but I never knew the full story.I read The Code Book in high school, and I remember it being good, but in a recreational way. It piqued my interest but I didn't really shelf it with ""high literature"" like I did with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid or Music of the Spheres: The Material Universe From Atom to Quaser, Simply Explained. It was enough for me, a young geeky teenager, to have a little fun playing with codes, then move on to another book. I am very happy that I returned to Singh, and I can confidently say this is the better of the two I've read. Mathematicians sure are a romantic lot."
411,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27336185-kenny,3," I'm not a maths person. I pretty much hated it at school, and pulled myself through somehow. So I was reading this as I was much more interested in the story of solving a problem that confounded the finest minds in maths for 300 years. It's based on the comment in the margins of a text from 17th century maths-genius/possibly most frustrating man in history Pierre de Fermat. A concept so simple even I could understand it (I can't do formula, here or anywhere but An +Bn =Cn can never be a whole number for any value of A and B above 2). Fermat posed this, and in 1637 scribbled he'd solved it, and promptly snuffed it. Inconsiderate really, as for the next 350 years no one could work it out, and many tried. Until Andrew Wiles did (just 15 years before the 200 year period to claim a prize for solving it ran out too.And that's basically the book. Singh covers a lot of complicated maths in this but does so well. There are passages that get into this, but as someone more interested in the human story than advanced theoretical maths, I found they were explained for the interested reader, but a full understanding wasn't essential to enjoy the telling of the tale. As Wiles' solution was based on solving and/or bringing together a number of other theorists work, this is a bit of a flythrough of a lot of complicated maths that while brain-melting, is also impressively interesting. Singh obviously had access to Wiles - who gave the story of how he did it, and which seems to be (perhaps characteristically) shorn of much of his emotions. A fascinating story, accessibly told."
412,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65863-elizabeth,5,"Fermat's Last Theorem is simple enough that anyone who understands Pythagorus' technique for finding the longest side of a right-angled triangle, can understand the conjecture that Fermat provides:a^n + b^n = c^n has no solutions in positive integers, if n is an integer greater than 2What is not easily understood is the story of how it was proved some 350 years later, but Simon Singh turns this story, over three-hundred years of mathematics, into a manageable and thrilling (yes thrilling!) read. The history of the theorem is in part the history of mathematics, and so in a way the history of how we understand the world. Singh boldly takes us from 350 BC to the 20th Century, explaining mathematical theory in plain intelligible English. He is not afraid to segue either into other interesting parts of history that his mathematicians lived through, so we see the burning of the Alexandrian Library, the French Revolution and the development of computing at Bletchley Park. Through Sophie Germain he investigates the role of female mathematicians in history and how they fought to be taught in the universities and be taken seriously. The concluded chapters describes Andrew Wiles's eight-year tackling of the proof reads more like a spy novel (in the best possible way) than a book on mathematics, a testament to Singh's skill at making what might be thought a dry subject one of intrigue and excitement.It is a startling and fascinating read from start to finish. "
413,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27705356-nidhi-gupta,5,"What an incredibly inspiring book!! My husband gifted this book to me in 2008, with a note ""We'll let our dreams guide us forever"". Though his note kept beckoning me to read the book, the book's rather heavy title kept me away from picking it up (even though my favorite subject in high-school was Math). Now that I've read the book, I realize how misguided my apprehension was. Simon Singh weaves such a wonderful tale of intrigue, passion, gossip, heartbreak, and persistence that surrounded the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem - the puzzle that baffled the finest mathematical brains for over 350 years. Although Fermat claimed that he had a proof of the Theorem, he did not write down this proof anywhere. Fermat's claim mocked at mathematicians for over three centuries some of whom(both men and women) invested their careers in trying to solve this rather simple looking problem.Without making any technical detail sound laborious, Singh beautifully takes us through the journey of many mathematicians who in one way or the other contributed to the epic quest to prove Fermat's Theorem. In particular, it tells us of the pursuits of one particular mathematician - Andrew Wiles - who got interested in the Theorem as a child and dedicated his career to realizing his dream of proving it. Another thing about the book that demands great merit is the comprehensible-to-layman style of writing that the author employs to tackle such a technical topic. I highly recommend this book and will definitely read other books by Simon Singh. "

Curiously, for all higher powers, there is no solution - and no proof of there being no solution either. And it remained unsolved for 350 years.We follow the progress made by stalwarts such as Euler, Fermat himself, Taniyama and Shimura among others along with delightful snippets of their lives, times and methods. The structure of pure mathematics and number theory is adequately explained along with its modern applications - especially in computing and cryptography (laymen read digital signatures). Also, please note that if you read popular science, you will not face any problems in reading this as the algebra is minimal. Also, if I can read Dawkins's books on evolution, others can easily read this :POnly problem is that I think modular forms were not adequately explained. I hope this will be corrected in future editions. This book was in my to-read list for some time but finally got around to picking it up as it was also in the selection of my recreational club's library - and they really have great taste.

415,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Great (4.5)--Although I would've appreciated a little more concrete math, Simon Singh does another superb job at explaining in lay terms what Fermat's Last Theorem meant for mathematics at large and what Andrew Wiles achieved in proving it after 350 years of numerous failures by other greatest minds of their times. It's a fascinating history whose intensity and influence can't be gleaned from just reading the theorem, which states simply:For n greater than 2, there is no whole number solution for the equation:x^(n)+y^(n)=z^(n).As simple as that. But the stories of the greatest mathematical geniuses who tried and failed in proving this theorem are so packed with tragedies, despairs, flashes of immense creativity, and human dramas that it's just a great topic to be treated in a book. Andrew Wiles's passion and sheer obsession with this theorem is moving and inspirational. How could anyone spend thirty years on a single problem when there were doubts even about the existence of a solution? Thirty years. I reel at the thought of it, and feel immense admiration for a man who kept his faith and followed his passion to the very end.Great story."

The actual proof manuscript by Andrew Wiles is 200 pages long and consists of beautiful blend of mathematical concepts with modern mathematics. Simon Singh has very beautifully explained the various approaches and attempts made to prove this theorem by mathematicians for over 350 years. She has step by step taken the reader to the times preceding the Fermat's time, to the time of Pythagoras, wherein lies the roots of this theorem. In this process she has taken us through brief life, time and works of various mathematicians whose work proved valuable in order for Andrew Wiles to proof this theorem.The book is written in a very interesting and catching style and surprisingly does not include any complex mathematics. And hence a person with basic high school understanding of mathematics can understand and grasp the concepts in this book.A must read for any mathematics fan."
417,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53101848-annabeth,4,"Good book for people who aren't math experts, but a little interested in the topic.It gives an insight not only on Fermat, his last theorem and Andrew Wiles, who eventually proved it, but also the lives of many great mathematicians before and after Fermat, their failed attempts to prove what can be considered THE THEOREM that lead to many important mathematical discoveries. It is truly remarkable - almost every mathematician of the 18th and 19th century tried to solve the problem, some were fascinated, some obsessed, and some devoted their entire lives and careers to it - until the last of them, Andrew Wiles, finally succeeded.Everyone who says math is boring has clearly never experienced the determination when you r e a l l y want to solve a problem, the despair and frustration when you rack your brain for weeks, months, or in this case, years, but can't find a solution and the joy when you finally accomplish it. This is what this book is really about. And it's educational but not too hard to understand at the same time - what more can you ask for. One of the best books about maths for non-mathematicians."

In this case he seems to have got in on the ground floor of the biggest mathematical discovery of the century -- the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994. Were it only for the reporting alone it would be worth a read, but Singh also does a creditable job of actually, you know, explaining the math. Unintimidated by Stephen Hawking's dictum that each equation reduces your sales by half, he succeeds by going big, delving as deep as he dares into the strategies of the many failed stabs at a proof, as well as Wiles' final triumph. I especially appreciated that Singh didn't shy away from the thorny abstraction of 20th century math, such as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture at the heart of the proof. A great many popular books will touch on Pythagoras and Euclid, Gauss and Germain, Hilbert and Gödel, but it's rare to read about more recent work, much less predictions for the future of mathematics (probably because it is all quite difficult and hasn't yet filtered into the public understanding)."

But it is so much more than just that. It gives you a peek inside a mathematicians life and the emotions that shroud and drive them. The book is extremely well written, sprinkled with a brief history of major mathematical theories and advances. One of the books that speak to you, warms you up and leaves you happy. A must read for anyone who has appreciated the beauty of theorems, marveled at the imagination of mathematicians and been awestruck by some of the greatest ideas of proofs. "
428,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,3,"Eh, acceptable pop math if you dig that kind of thing. Something like 4000 Fermat books got published shortly after 1993, many of them immediately seeing massive revisions following Katz's discovery of the Kolyvagin-Flach gaps.Where're the books about Grigori Perelman? He's a far more fascinating character, I bet."
429,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60293611-animesh,5,what a read! this book has everything. initially I thought it to be a child's read but the pace with which it catches up.Andrew Wiles really has used such a host of techniques (which I leaned only as a naive overview). This book really portrays the story of the Fermat's last theorem.it has revived in me my lost curiosity to study mathematics.
430,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23355879-dan-pfeiffer,4,"The author does a good job of describing the historical drama around the many brilliant minds, both men and women, who played a part in the 350 year assault on the Fermat's Last Theorem mathematic problem until it was finally solved by Andrew Wiles in the early 90's."
431,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36792925-tanmay-band,4,Fascinating account of the history and intrigue surrounding one of the seemingly simple but equally notorious theorems of Mathematics. Delves into exciting depths of the basic math and history behind it. Compelling read for the mathematically inclined.
432,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502841-mark-galassi,5,As close to perfect as I have seen for a popular science or math book.
433,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5092154-jon-gauthier,4,An accessible and well-written account of a fascinating history.
434,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23807173-jayaram-prabhu-durairaj,5,my mathematics obsession is rekindled !
435,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5146825-dan-lee,4,I have a truly marvellous review of this book which this website is too small to contain.
436,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5852226-michael-kotsarinis,4,A great book for anyone interested in numbers that requires virtually no knowledge of mathematics. It reads more like a novel than science!
437,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11266638-karina,5,"A truly beautiful, romantic, exciting and entertaining book, for those who love history, math and good stories."
438,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38772733-radheshyam-balasundaram,4,Had a lot of interesting anecdotes about mathematicians.
439,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48729484-holly-weatherby,5,"Very easy read. Language and explanation very accessible. The relationship between Wiles and the conjecture (theorem) is portrayed as a sort secret love affair, this deepens the reading experience."
440,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18640163-raja-muthyala,4,A fantastic and engaging read. 
441,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"I was never good at math and so I largely hated the subject, and, as always, that was largely due to the fact that I had the wrong teachers. None of them could properly convey to me the beauty of mathematics or the fun of the subject, and, I'll be real, I was also somewhat apathetic to the subject. It doesn't make any sense to me then why I find myself drawn to mathematics lately.I picked this book up because I pass by it regularly at the library I work at and was curious. Finishing it I can honestly say it's one of the finest books I've ever read, as well as one of the most intellectually engaging. Simon Singh tells the story of an equation that has baffled mathematicians for centuries while also narrating the journey of discoveries which eventually made it solvable, and finally, he tells all these stories in relation to one man, Andrew Wiles who would eventually provide the functional proof. This book engages the reader, and while there are some explanations of the math that left me stumped, I was impressed to find effective explanations for concepts and equations that had always left me baffled. This is an accessible read.But most important, Fermat's Enigma is a book that convey's the passion of the author for beauty and the possibility of mathematics. Numbers are more than just empty abstract symbols, they are complex entities that define and create our reality and so equations are ways for human beings to understand our world more fully.Even if you've never read a math book, or a history of math, I would recommend this wonderful little book. It's changed the way I look at math and numbers and mh own universe in profound ways. "
442,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23148376-john-a-raju,4,"An excellent piece of work tracing the journey of a problem that had eluded a solution for 358 years of intense scrutiny by mathematicians around the world. The beauty of it is that the conjecture itself is simple to state and understand, but maths is a subject that relies on proofs and not just examples in favor of the conjecture. And this is where mathematicians were hitting a roadblock with regards to Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that 'there exists no whole numbers x,y,z that satisfies the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for values of n>2'. The case of n=2 is of course the famous Pythagoras Theorem. The book is penned almost like a novel, possessing a narrative flow, plotlike structure and strong universe building through consistent, layman term explanations for technical terms and concepts. For those who were interested in maths during high school, or are interested even now, this would be an engaging read. (This is not a textbook equivalent however). A quick yet immensely satisfying read."
443,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79032588-john-isles,4,"The book tells the story of many of the mathematicians who sought to discover the proof of Fermat's so-called Last Theorem, as well as of their predecessors on whose shoulders they stood. There are explanations of several basic mathematical concepts and techniques, but the final proof found by Andrew Wiles in 1995 is described only sketchily.Pierre de Fermat's conjecture, as it's more correctly called, since the seventeenth-century mathematician didn't give a proof, states that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2. On a page of a book he was annotating he wrote: ""I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain."" Whether he was mistaken or he was kidding, the quest for a proof has inspired many mathematicians over the centuries. "
444,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18640010-olesya-razuvayevskaya,5,"I have written a truly marvelous review to this book which this margin is too narrow to contain.This book is a example of an extremely well written science (or rather history) book that has a potential of captivating both general and professional audiences. Simon Singh managed to put the proof of an extremely complicated matter into a coherent story that takes you on a journey and does not feel boring for a second. Never losing its main focus of Fermat's conjecture (now a theorem), the author was able to cover the history of mathematics, particularly, number theory, from the times of Pythagoras to late 90s. Similarly to Wiles' proof, all chapters fall very well into the final puzzle, and the suspense of the story is very well preserved. The book is not packed with an overwhelming number of formulas, but is certainly not superficial - you can learn a lot of technical facts, come across puzzles and fun conjectures with proofs in the Appendix, and useful references for extra reading. Will you have a full understanding of the proof upon reading it? Obviously no, this is not the focus of the book, and is a goal too ambitious unless you are highly familiar with very particular areas of mathematics, such as elliptic equations and modular forms. Will you have a general understanding of the concepts and logic upon which the proof is built? Yes. The amount of research put into the topic, the familiarity and fascination of the author with the character of Wiles and mathematics in general shows, and makes the book extremely inspiring."
445,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Strikes a good balance between keeping the reader's interest with lurid tales (two suicides, an execution by drowning, and of course Galois' death by duel) and getting into the technicalities of number theory and the proof. Obviously it isn't spelled out in detail, but the basic thrust of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture connecting elliptical curves to modular forms, Frey's extension of that to Fermat's theorem, and then Wiles' use of the Kolyvagin–Flach method to prove the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, is about as good as you can do at this level. Includes lots of tangents about the use of number theory in cryptography, evolutionary biology, etc."
446,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24879473-jawahar-surti,4,"4/5A very well written account of one man's journey to find the solution to the what had been elusive for centuries. Each chapter covers what was a step to attain that objective. Without going into the technical aspect of the subject - which would have made it impossible to read - the author has simplified the subject. So without actually showing us the proof, he has been successful in showing us the path that was taken, the turmoil of Andrew Wiles and the triumph. Hats off to Wiles for sticking with what he believed he could prove against all odds."
447,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829594-prasanth-kancharla,5,"What if we have to compete with an intelligent alien race to demonstrate our advancements? We can use our advanced AI to challenge them in a game of Go , show off our  Standard Model  and compare it with theirs (their understanding of the fundamental nature of universe) or can challenge them to solve the Fermat’s Last theorem. Among the three, I would bet that our chances of beating them are higher in the 3rd case. The story of Fermat's last theorem reveals the nature of mathematics and what differentiates it from physics or any other language. The millions of successful observations are not enough to confirm its validity like most of the theories in physics. Or the aesthetics and beauty of the conjecture qualify it to be accepted as a theorem like in literature of poetry. This is reflected in the struggle of many great mathematicians over 300 years and one man's effort for 8 years to prove the enigma that Fermat has left. I enjoyed Simon Singh's approach to bringing the complex details and events that lead to Andrew Wile's proof of the theorem. An inspirational journey that is unique for its own reasons that could not have happened in any other discipline. "
448,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54911863-sagar-papneja,4,"This was my first book on story of mathematics and what a joy it was. Simon made it a child's play to read this while taking a reader through the history of mathematics and mathmagicians. The storytelling, surprising for the subject, is spectacular. Though it got a little difficult to keep a track of concepts in the later half, the curiosity stayed throughout."
449,0385493622,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435897-louis-s-b,5,Most engaging book about mathematics of all time. Singh is a genius at presenting complex topics in novelistic ways.
