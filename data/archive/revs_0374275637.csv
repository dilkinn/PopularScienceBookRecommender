The first was Daniel Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" and the second is Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" What caused this? What do they have in common? Both books explain, in minute detail, simple concepts with immensely far-reaching implications, and both have been... after the slog... the most intellectually rewarding reading of my adult life. Where to begin... I have a number of theories running around in my head, and occasionally I try to corral them on paper. I organize, sequence and interconnect them in a way that will prevent my reader from meaningfully widening their eyes, in an aside, while winding their finger around one ear... (""Cuckoo!"") Good writing about complex topics is very, very difficult, and Kahneman has corraled 30+ years of science, his career and all he has learned into a perfectly arranged sequence that leads the reader into a wilderness... provisioning you in each chapter with the tools you'll need for the next part of the journey.The second most striking effect on me is the number of times I said, ""Yes... YES!!! this is what I've been saying!"" In my case it has usually been some sort of ""intuitive""(excuse me, Mr. Kahneman... I mean ""System 1"") recognition of a pattern in my observations about the way we think. In Kahneman's case those intuitions have been converted into theoretical propositions, each meticulously researched in well designed experiments. Clearly, this is at least one difference between me and a Nobel Prize winning researcher.So why does this stuff matter? In the context of broader discussions of free will, intention, choice and control over the directions our lives take, this book can provide powerful insights that might currently be obscured by these ""cognitive illusions"" and the inherent limitations of ""System 1/System 2"" thinking. Perhaps we're not as ""free"" in our decisions as we might like to think, if ""priming"" has such a stunningly reproducible effect. Perhaps we're not so determined, if activities that initially require ""System 2"" attention, can be turned into second-nature, ""technical-expertise intuitions."" I.e. learning and training MATTERS in our ability to detect and respond to events that... if untrained... might take advantage of our brain's inherent ""blind spots"" or weaknesses. Perhaps childhood religious indoctrination is a very adept recognition of these mental tendencies/flaws, so profoundly (if intuitively/naively) expressed by Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order, ""Give me the boy until 7, I will give you the man."" (paraphrased; forgive me) Kahneman's discoveries and documentation of mental capacity and biases could form the basis of a ""Mental Martial Arts"" program: an alternative form of indoctrination, in which students are trained to understand their brains' weaknesses, and learn to take stances or engage in practices that eliminate or reduce the errors to which these weaknesses can lead. This book will rearrange the way you think... about how you think."
1,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671574-john,1,"An unrelentingly tedious book that can be summed up as follows. We are irrationally prone to jump to conclusions based on rule-of-thumb shortcuts to actual reasoning, and in reliance on bad evidence, even though we have the capacity to think our way to better conclusions. But we're lazy, so we don't. We don't understand statistics, and if we did, we'd be more cautious in our judgments, and less prone to think highly of our own skill at judging probabilities and outcomes. Life not only is uncertain, we cannot understand it systemically, and luck has just as much to do with what happens to us -- maybe even more -- than we care to admit. When in doubt, rely on an algorithm, because it's more accurate than your best guess or some expert's opinion. Above all, determine the baseline before you come to any decisions. If you like endless -- and I mean endless -- algebraic word problems and circuitous anecdotes about everything from the author's dead friend Amos to his stint with the Israeli Air Defense Force, if you like slow-paced, rambling explanations that rarely summarize a conclusion, if your idea of a hot date is to talk Bayesian theory with a clinical psychologist or an economist, then this book is for you, who are likely a highly specialized academically-inclined person. Perhaps you are even a blast at parties, I don't know. But if you're like me and you prefer authors to cut to the chase, make their point, and then leave you with a whopping big appendix if you're interested in the regression analysis of how many freshmen would watch a guy choke to death because they think someone else will come to the rescue, then this book is not for you.If you want to take the Reader's Digest pass through the book, then Chapter 1 and Section 3 are probably the most accessible and can be read in less than an hour, and still leave you with a fair understanding of the author's thesis."
2,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This is a fascinating book. Reading this book means not having to read so many others. For example, you could avoid having to read, Sway, Blink, Nudge and probably a dozen or so other books on Behavioural Economics. And the best part of it is that this is the guy (or, at least one half of the two guys) who came up with these ideas in the first place. I was thinking that perhaps the best way to explain those other books would be to compare them to Monty Python. I want you to imagine something - say you had spent your entire life and never actually seen an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. That wouldn't mean you wouldn't know anything about Monty Python. It is impossible to have lived at any time since the late 60s and not have had some socially dysfunctional male reprise the entire Parrot sketch or Spanish Inquisition sketch at you at some stage in your life. I suspect, although there is no way to prove this now, obviously, that Osama bin Laden could do the Silly Walk like a natural. Well, if you had never seen an episode of Monty Python and your entire experience of their work was via the interpretation of men of a certain age down the pub - then finally getting to see an episode of the original would be much the same effect as reading this book. Hundreds of people have already told all this guy's best stories in their own books - but all the same it is a pleasure to hear them again by the guy that first said, 'this parrot is dead' or rather, 'framing effects make fools of us all'.You need to read this book - but what is particularly good about it is that you come away from it knowing we really are remarkably easy to fool. It's because we think we know stuff that this comes as a constant surprise to us. Years ago I was talking to a guy who liked to bet. Everyone needs a hobby and that was his. Anyway, he told me he was playing two-up - an Australian betting game - and he realised something like tails hadn't come up frequently enough and so he started betting on tails and sure enough he made money. I told him that coins don't remember the last throw and so the odds of getting a tail was still 50%, as it had previously been. But I had no credibility - I'd already told him I never bet - so, how would I possibly know anything if I wasn't even brave enough to put my own money on the outcome? And didn't I understand the point of this story was he had already WON?Still, when faced with a series of coin flips that run - H, H, H, H, H, T, H, H, H - it does feel like tails are 'due'. This is the sort of mistake we are all too prone to make. The thing to remember is that while there is a law of large numbers - toss a coin often enough and in the very long run there will be as many heads turn up as tails - that isn't the case in the short run - where just about anything is possible.We (that is, we humans) are remarkably bad at mental statistics. And what makes it worse is that we are predictably bad at statistics. And this brings me to Bourdieu and him saying that Sociology is kind of martial art. He means that Sociology allows you to defend yourself from those who would manipulate you. Well, this book is the Bruce Lee book of advanced self-defence. Learning just how we fool ourselves might not make you feel terribly great about what it means to be human - but at least you will know why you hav stuffed up next time you do stuff up. I'm not sure it will stop you stuffing up - but that would be asking for an awful lot from one book.If you want the short version of this book, he has provided the two papers that probably got him the Nobel Prize - and they are remarkably clear, easy to understand and comprehensive. But look, read this book - it will do you good. "
3,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"I kind of want to cut this book in half, praise the first part, and stick the second part in some corner to gather dust. Not that the second part is bad, mind you; the entire book is well-written and obviously the product of someone who knows their field. There’s just a lot of it. Thinking, Fast and Slow is kind of like a guest who shows up to your party and then dazzles everyone with an impromptu, 15-minute oration on the geopolitical situation in South Ossetia; and, everyone applauds and turns to go back to their own conversations, only for the guest to launch into another story about the time they parachuted into the Balkans to break up a nascent civil war, a story which is followed quickly by a similar tale of a visit to Southeast Asia…. Well, I think you catch my drift. Daniel Kahneman spins an interesting tale of human psychology and the way our brains interpret and act on data. But the book overstays its welcome by a few hundred pages.Kahneman’s thesis breaks our decision-making systems into two pieces, System 1 and System 2, which are the respective “fast” and “slow” of the title. System 1 provides intuitive judgements based on stimulus we might not even be conscious of receiving; it’s the snap signals that we might not even know we are acting upon. System 2 is the more contemplative, cognitively taxing counterpart that we engage for serious mental exertion. Though often oppositional in the types of decisions they produce, Kahneman is keen to emphasize that it’s not about System 1 versus System 2. Instead, he’s out to educate us about how the interplay between these systems causes us to make decisions that aren’t always rational or sensible given the statistics and evidence at hand.Kahneman takes us through an exhaustive tour of biases and fallacies people are prone to making. He talks about the halo effect, affection bias, confirmation bias, and even regression to the mean. As a mathematician, I liked his angle on probability and statistics; as a logician, I appreciated his brief segues into the logical aspects of our contradictory decision-making processes. Lest I give the impression Kahneman gets too technical, however, I should emphasize that, despite its length, Thinking, Fast and Slow remains aggressively accessible. There are a few points where, if you don’t have a basic grasp of probability (and if Kahneman demonstrates anything, it’s that most people don’t), then you might feel talked over (or maybe it’s those less-than-infrequent, casual mentions of “and later I won a Nobel Prize”). But this book isn’t so much about science as it is about people.There are two other things I really appreciated about this book, both of which are related to psychology. I’m a fairly easygoing person, and I don’t always like to make waves, but sometimes I like to make some trouble and argue with some of my friends about whether psychology is a science. The problem for psychology is that it’s actually a rather broad term for a series of overlapping fields of investigation into human behaviour. On one end of this continuum, you have Freud and Jung and the various psychoanalysts who, let’s face it, are one step up from astrologers and palm-readers. On the other end, you have the cutting-edge cognitive psychology informed by the neuroscience of MRIs, split-brain studies, and rat research. So claiming that psychology is or isn’t a science is a little simplistic, and I’m willing to grant that there are areas within psychology that are science. For what it’s worth, Kahneman went a long way to reinforcing this: it’s clear he and his collaborators have done decades of extensive research. (Now, yes, it’s social science, but I won’t get into that particular snobbery today.)The other thing I liked about Thinking, Fast and Slow is its failure to mention evolutionary psychology. Once in a while, Kahneman alludes to System 1’s behaviour being the result of evolutionary adaptation—and that’s fine, because it is true, almost tautologically so. But he never quite delves into speculation about why such behaviour evolved, and I appreciate this. There’s a difference between identifying something as an adaptation and determining why it’s an adaptation, and I’m not a fan of evolutionary psychologists’ attempts to reduce everything to the trauma of trading trees for bipedalism … I’m willing to admit I have an ape brain, but culture must count for something, hmm?I suppose it’s also worth mentioning that this book reaffirms my supercilious disregard for economics. According to Kahneman, stock brokers and investors have no idea what they are doing—and some of them know this, but most of them don’t. Economists are, for the most part, highly-trained, but they seem bent upon sustaining this theoretical fantasy land in which humans are rational creatures. Aristotle aside, the data seem to say it isn’t so. I occasionally try my hand at reading books about the economy, just so I can say I did, but they usually end up going over my head. I’m a mathematician and I don’t get numbers—but at least I’m not the only one.So Thinking, Fast and Slow is genuinely interesting. I learned a lot from it. I would rate it higher, but I was starting to flag as I approached the finish line. Truth be told, I skipped the two articles Kahneman includes at the end that were the original publications about the theories he explains in the book. I’m sure they are fascinating for someone with more stamina, but at that point I just wanted to be done. That’s never good: one of the responsibilities of a non-fiction author is to know how to pace a book and keep its length appropriate. Too short and the book is unsatisfying—too long, and maybe it’s more so. And I think this flaw is entirely avoidable; it’s a result of Kahneman’s tendency to reiterate, to circle back around to the same discussions over and over again. He spends an entire chapter on prospect theory, then a few chapters later he’s telling us about its genesis all over again, just from a slightly different angle. Like that party guest, Kahneman is full of interesting stories, but after telling one after another for such a long period of time, it starts sounding like white noise. And he ate all those little cocktail snacks too.I inevitably ended up comparing Thinking, Fast and Slow to 
How We Decide
, a much slimmer volume along much the same lines as this one. Whereas Lehrer’s focus is on the neurology behind decision-making, Kahneman is more interested in the psychology. Both books boil down to: we suck at automatic decision-making when statistics are involved; therefore, we behave less rationally than we believe we do. Lehrer explains why things go wrong, and Kahneman categorizes all the different way things go wrong. In many ways the books are complementary, and if this is an area of interest for you, I’ll recommend them both. For the casual reader, however, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rather dense meal. By all means, give it a try, but take it slow.Also posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my reviews and subscribe to my digest newsletter.

4,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14972518-vijai,4,"If your objective, like it is when one finishes reading a self-help book, is to implement what Mr. Kahneman has to say in real life and benefit from it, I should warn you, you will be sorely disappointed. Believe it or not, in my opinion, I believe Mr. Kahneman is telling you exactly that in this book - that whether you like it or not, your entire life is guided or may I say decided by two fundamental ideas and that there is very little you can do to change it, period. Mr. Kahneman is probably the villain in every modern day spiritual guru's life, he argues very effectively that contrary to what these gurus may say the external world/ your environment/ surroundings/ or even society for that matter has a large say in your personal deliberate actions. You don't have a choice. So, having said that, shelving this book in psychology section would be gross injustice. In my view this is such a good commentary of human nature. The two are different, very much so. Read it, totally worth it in my opinion. Can get a little too drab but hang in there, this book is an eye opener."
5,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369435-jay-kamaladasa,5,"Hands down, one of the best books in its genre. The book is a lengthy, self-conscious and a challenging read but highly recommended if you're interested in why human beings behave the way they behave. It's given me so much 'oh snap, so that's why we're so dumb' moments that at this point I don't even want to admit I'm a human to any space-time traveling race that comes in collision of 21st century Earth.Citing behavioral research studies, he's convinced me that human confidence is a measure of whether a person has built up a coherent story not that the person truly knows what she's doing. He's convinced me that the feeling of 'ease' is just cognitive familiarity. He's convinced me why first impressions matter more than we think due to the Halo effect. He's convinced me that the human mind doesn't understand non-events. We think we understand the past, but we really don't. We create coherency by attributing causality to events, but not to non-events. In other words we underestimate the role of luck or the role of unknown variables in a given situation. He has given me reason to believe that in low validity environments, it's better to use formula's than to listen to expert human judgment. For example, the stability of a marriage can be better predicted by a simple equation like [stability = frequency of love making - frequency of arguing] than an expert opinion.But one of the most interesting hypothesis he builds up is the existence of two systems in the mind. System 1 is prone to cognitive biases described above, but it's also where morality comes from. Not to mention intuitive judgment and hueristic answers to life's everyday questions. Would you believe it? Morality is more of an intuitive thing than a logical and reasonable framework! And the funny thing is without system 1, we'd won't survive a day in the life. Not to mention we wouldn't act human. System 2 on the other hand is more introspective, rational and is capable of being aware of the cognitive biases created by System 1. If my understanding is correct then, we can replicate system 2 by a machine or artificial intelligence. But that machine will not have the same extent of morality that we have.... food for thought! In later chapters of the book, he describes another variation of duality in the human mind. An Experiencing Self and a Remembering Self. With countless examples (both experimental and anecdotal) he vividly paints a picture of how humans have this notion of ""I am my remembering self, and strangely my experiencing self is a stranger to me."" We're actually okay with letting our Experiencing Self suffer for the good of the Remembering Self!! This ties in to the cognitive bias of ""focusing Illusion"" (Focalism) and how we tend to overestimate a certain aspect of life. To put the icing on the cake he finalizes the book by analyzing how we appreciate, value and judge the quality of our lives with all these biases combined. And it's amazing how irrational we are in doing so. Not only have I realized from this book that I should stop worrying about societal standards (because they are mostly based on irrational biases) but that I should spend a significant amount of my time and effort to into creating a value structure ideally suited for myself. Now, only if I had bit more memory and cpu speed on System 2..."
6,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,3,"Thinking, Fast and Slow is just okay. It's being marketed as a book on psychology (and economic psychology, in particular) for the layperson. I'm not sure if other laypeople agree, but this wasn't really for me. And it's not that the prose is too technical (okay, sometimes it is) but rather that Kahneman is stuck somewhere between academic technicalities and clear expressive prose. Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement. You can read why I came to this decision here.In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook"
7,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"It is very difficult to judge, review or analyze a book that basically challenges the very idea of human “Rationalism”. Are humans perfectly rational? This dude, Daniel Kahneman, got a Nobel Prize in Economics for saying they are not. An ordinary person might have been treated with glare or a stinging slap if he said that to someone’s face. We simply don’t like being told that we are not very rational and certainly not as intelligent as we think we are. Hidden in the depths of our consciousness, are some ‘actors’ that keep tempering with our ‘rationality’. And we almost consciously allow this to happen. 	All in all, this book is a tour de force of Behavioral Psychology. Explaining how our mind comes to conclusions and makes decisions, Kahneman explains that our intuition and decision making part of brain has two personalities. These personalities, he says, are not two different or distinct systems but to understand them better, we will have to assign personalities not only to understand them better but also to be able to relate to them on a personal level. 	The two systems are called system 1 and system 2, for the sake of convenience. System 1 is vigilant, impulsive, judgmental, easily manipulated, highly emotional. System 2, on the other hand is the total opposite of system 1, it is very intelligent, indolent, mostly drowsing off in the back of our head, difficult to convince and extremely stubborn, and it only comes to action when there is some sort of ‘emergency’. Both these systems are susceptible to a number of biases, system 1 more than system 2.	I thought Kahneman would build up this narrative systematically but he goes on to give us a tour of his years of research, experiments and surveys exploring every nook of our conscious human mind. He focuses on a diverse set of heuristics and biases that influence our judgments in everyday life. With some brilliant experiments and survey reports, he convincingly elaborates the effects that these biases have on our decisions. Never forgetting to highlight the fallacies of our consciousness, he touches on a number of other important breakthroughs in the world of psychology. This is a very simple case of visual illusion where we see two lines of same size appearing to be of varying lengths. Even after knowing that they are equal and the illusion is created by the fins attached to them, our system 1 still impulsively signals that one of them is longer then the other. Through this simple illustration, he moves on to introduce Cognitive Illusions, which are more fascinating, and are drastically more effective.	Kahneman contends that it is extremely difficult to overcome heuristic biases. Although, through methods like using statistical formulas and deliberate scrutiny we can ‘rationalize’ our decisions to some extent. Still, we are inherently prone to fall for dazzling rhetoric and dashing figures, we believe in myths and incidents that are as improbable as they are ludicrous, because this is the way we see things. But this is not undesirable altogether, some of the intuitive abilities are an evolutionary blessing that help us understand emotions and make correct decision in split seconds. Neither does the author deems it expedient to overcome these biases, but only to recognize them and put our system 2 to work before making crucial judgments. 	 I am afraid that this review is getting a bit too long, and to be honest, I don’t think anyone reads long reviews.(Except some of my nerdy goodread friends who then leave an equally baffling Proustian comment, which of course, takes quite a while to be properly understood.) So I will mention a summary of some critical biases, ideas and psychological phenomenon that I found interesting. 	---------------------------------------------------------------I have attempted to summarize some heuristics, biases and psychological principle that I thought would make a fascinating introduction to tempt a novice like me to further explore the subject. They are just the tip of iceberg and not by any means exhaustive and just comprise a small part of what this book is all about. Associative machine: System 1 works in surprising ways, read this 			BANANA VOMIT Now, a lot happened in last few seconds when you read these two words. You wore an expression of disgust and a very bad image came to your mind, your body too reacted in disgust and for short time you might not want to eat bananas. All of this was automatic and beyond your control. It was “The Associative Machine” of system 1. We associate seemingly some unrelated images and with some imagination, form an image. Our brain loves patterns and some times it sees things that aren’t even there. A very interesting clip in which Simon Singh shows associative machine at work : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bG7E...Priming: Exposure to a word causes immediate changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen if you had just seen WASH.Similarly, exposure to an idea or event can also have similar temporary effect on our behavior. (“Florida Effect”)Cognitive Ease: We all love it when we don’t have to work too hard because system 2 doesn’t like being bothered. So we admire and rather look for cognitive ease. Things that are less complex have a positive effect on our behavior. Psychologists use the term “Mind at ease puts a smile on the face”. Similarly, smiling and laughing can also ease our mind (system 1) and make us feel confident and in control. Anything that is easy to understand (read or see) is likely to have a more positive effect on us as compared to anything that we have a hard time understanding or visualizing.Exposure Effect: We are more likely to choose the thing we are more familiar with. The principle that “Familiarity breeds liking” suggests that we are more inclined towards anything that is familiar and has been exposed to us before in past. The more the exposure is, the more we will be inclined towards it. This principle is excellently illustrated in Will Smith’s “Focus” (2015).a similar trick is used to con a billionaire. Normality illusion: Things that recur with greater frequency are considered normal, no matter how horrendous they are. Two people killed in a terrorist attack in a western country are more likely to be mourned then a hundreds of children killed in Gaza by a missile strike. Simply due to the fact that children in Gaze get bombed all the time, while a terrorist attack that kills innocents is sort of rarity in Europe and America. (The same concept is present in Orwell’s Animal Farm in which pigs start to dominate other animals and it becomes the norm after a while.)Substitution: If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it. For instance when asked How happy are you with your life these days? Its more likely that we don’t use a broad frame to answer the question and substitute it with a simpler question “What is my mood right now?”. System 1 can readily answer the substitute question but to answer the real question, System 2 would have to be excited, which as we know System 2 doesn’t like. In everyday life, we use this to avoid making decisions and expressions based on factual background and therefore make an impulsive and sometimes irrational comment to a difficult question.  What you see is there is: We take pride in our intuitive abilities which leads us to believe that we know the whole truth, no matter how fallible our sources are, and not withstanding the fact that there is always another side of the picture. When we hear a story or an incident, we tend to accept it as a fact without considering any view dissenting or contradicting it. Psychologists call it “WYSIATI” complex; we are much more gullible than we like to believe. But it is again the mischief of System 1 that leads us to believe a narrative impulsively and without further inquisition as to its authenticity. It is also another example of our intuitive tendency to see things in a narrow frame.Loss Aversion: Call it a gift of evolution or survival instinct, but we are naturally loss averse in most of our decisions. We are more likely to abandon a huge profit if there is some probability of an equally huge loss. We do want to have more, but not at the cost of putting our own at stake, we relish our possessions more than our desire to have more. Overconfidence and Hindsight bias: A general limitation of our mind is its imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge, or beliefs that have changed. Once you adopt a new view of the world (or any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed. We see people everyday saying that what just happened was what they always thought would happen and they, in their overconfidence, start believing that they always knew in hindsight that such an event was probable. (see Halo Effect) Prospect theory: This theory attempts to explain the way people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. Kahneman illustrates it through this graph This theory is one of his most important in the field of behavioral economics. Owing to its complexity, I can not summarize it here. P.S I highly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in Behavioral Psychology. Don’t waste your time on self-help books when you can read the real stuff."
8,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,4,"Often I find myself in conversations with people who are criminally opinionated, but have little in the way of empirical grounding. It’s common in these situations to hear them malign opponents of their views by reducing the conflict to a single factor; My opponent is so dumb they couldn’t hump a bacteria if they were a horny phage. Now, putting aside the fact that single factor analysis is a mugs game when discussing things of any complexity (which is basically everything), when resorting to these oversimplifications with human behavior, you asymptotically approach infinite incorrectness. My common refrain in these times is to dip into my quote bag and castigate the misguided with Popper’s glib witticism: “A theory that explains everything, explains nothing.” Or, channeling the Arch Bishop of astuteness, John Stuart Mill, I rise up, gesturing dramatically and pitching my voice just so: “He who knows only his side of the case knows little of that.” Hoping their snotty self assurance will recede before my rational indignation like an anabolic hairline.This shit never works. Putting aside the fact that I’m subject to the same cognitive limitations, quotations often arrive on the scene like a flaccid member, with intimations of a proper impression hidden somewhere in that bloodless noodle, if only the other party would play with it. But, much like idioms, there’s just not enough chemistry to warrant heavy petting.Next I will resort to recalling numerous studies which have totally pin-cushioned the quaint notion that we are dispassionate, logical thinkers. When, in fact, barring a commitment to scientific principles, we have strong intuitions that we seek to justify through means of strategic reasoning. “We’re more like lawyers than Vulcans.” I say solemnly. Starring off into the distance for dramatic effect. Pensive. Avoiding eye contact for an appropriate interval before turning to peer into their soul and nod as we grasp, however tenuously, our feeble position before the Logos. Inevitably, when this numinous moment arrives, I am instead greeted with a vacant stare, or, much worse, an objection! Which, if you’ve been following me so far, means that I switch from attempting to persuade and instead silently chide my opponent for being a hopeless imbecile.How do we opt out of being unrelenting self righteous pricks? Well, we probably can’t fully, the gravity is just too strong. Escape velocity would require some fundamental redesigns to a cognitive apparatus which evolved to intuit a subset of phenomena on the African savanna which bore a relationship to our reproductive success. But we can sure as hell beat one another with books like this until we piss blood and can’t hold our toothbrushes due to nasty rotator cuff injuries. That’ll teach us. I consider this to be the Mac Daddy of bibliophilic bludgeoning implements on this topic. I once blasted a man in the chest so hard with the spine of this book that, in addition to the bastard rolling clean over a Pizza Hut table like it was the hood of a speeding vehicle, the pages burst from between the covers like a fox vomiting hen feathers. So incensed by this needless destruction of literary property, I stood over the man and berated him on the importance of properly breaking in the spines of hardcovers. As he wormed about in pepperoni and soda, nodding (if for no other reason than to avoid another terrible sounding of his sternum) I also took the time to explain the central message of this book:“Look, man. You need to realize that we’ve got these two modes of cognition. One is accessible to us. It’s slow and deliberative and subject to systematic interventions of logic if we but choose to learn and apply them. The other does pretty much whatever it damn well pleases based on input it receives from the environment that you’re often not consciously aware of.

I'm leaving it out in the living room for now, though--for refreshers.The author's aim is to prove to us that we are not rational beings to the extent we think we are, that evolution has seen to that. And that being the case, the book outlines what we need to know so as not to mess up decisions like we have been doing--like we all do. And he's made it accessible. He pulls you in. You will get your share of ""Aha!"" moments. You can read it at whatever level you want. You can skim over the more complicated parts and go for the pithy conclusions. Or if you are really into the science and scholarship, there are footnotes in the back--stealth footnotes without the little numbers on the book's pages, so as not to intimidate the general audience. All based on science. It's true whether you like it or not. And it is applicable to your life. You can't go over it, you can't go under it, so go through it--with this book.

It doesn't set out to be a new book full of new discoveries. It's a comfortable round up of research, investigations and thought, polished off with a couple of Kahneman's early articles as appendices. If you've read The Halo Effect ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers(which puts some of these cogitative delusions in a business context, it has an excellent anecdote about the failure of a Lego product), or something along those lines you'll be familiar with some of the ideas here.By now I'm quite comfortable accepting that I am not rational and that other people aren't either and that statistical thinking is alien to probably to almost everybody and Kahneman's book happily confirms my opinion. And few things make us as happy as having our own biases confirmed to us.There are however a couple of problems. Firstly there are some people who apparently are wedded to the notion that people are entirely rational. They either will not read this book, read and reject it or indeed read it, accept it's findings but mentally note them as curious aberrations that don't affect their belief - this is discussed in the book.More seriously society is organised on the tacit assumption that we are not only capable of being rational but will put the effort into doing so when required. Unfortunately studies demonstrating the effect of meals on Judges reviewing parole cases (like the state pawn broker in Down and out in Paris and London they are more lenient after lunch and harsher beforehand and once they get hungry again) or voter behaviour which turns out to be influenced by where the polling booth is located. This makes me wonder. My polling station used to be in the Adult Education Centre, now that's been closed down, if the polling centre was moved to the police station would my voting habits transform into those of a Fishin', Huntin' and Floggin' Tory who froths at the mouth hearing the words 'illegal immigrants'? Maybe I need a snack. Much in the book is useful, 90% fat free does sound better than 10% fat, there's a lot to be learnt here in how to describe or state a problem to push people towards certain responses by framing or anchoring the information you give. Of course this happens to us all the time as it is. One of my favourite of Kahneman's examples comes from when he was working with Israeli flight instructors. They were convinced that shouting and swearing at trainee pilots was the best method of improving their performance - experience proved it - when a pilot under performed they swore at him and on the next attempt the trainee would do better. Plainly shouting works. Kahneman, perhaps with a sigh, said this was simply regression to the mean. After poor performance what ever they did would be followed by improved performance, swearing and shouting have no magic power. To demonstrate he had the instructors throw balls of paper over their shoulder's into a waste paper bin and tracked the results on a handy black board showing that performance varied up and down irrespective of swearing. Still I wonder if returning to work the instructors developed an enlightened instruction method or if they rapidly regressed to the mean and shouted and swore again.I used to think that politicians answered a different question to the one given by the interviewer in an attempt to be evasive. Post Kahneman I wonder if this is just the natural tendency of the brain to substitute an easier question for a harder one. Who knows. "
11,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an excellent book about how we think, written by a Nobel-prize-winning economist. Kahneman explains how two ""systems"" in the mind make decisions. ""System 1"" is the fast, intuitive aspect of the mind. ""System 2"" is the slower, logical and reasoning part of the mind. We generally make decisions quickly with the System 1, often because System 2 is simply--lazy. It takes effort to think things out rationally, and our rational minds are not always up to the job. This book is a long, comprehensive explanation of why we make decisions the way we do. Both systems are necessary, but both are subject to fallacies. Kahneman explains many of these fallacies. Most people do not really understand probability, so we are not good at judging relative levels of risk. Our decisions are strongly colored by how we frame questions in our minds. Simply re-framing a question can easily cause people--even professionals like doctors--to reverse decisions. We need to understand these framing issues, to avoid bad decisions. Elements of causality and Bayesian probability are described in some detail.One of the most interesting aspects of the ways we think, is the concept of availability. Often, when subjected to a difficult question, we answer immediately. But really, we do not answer the question at hand--we have made a subtle switch to a simpler question, without even realizing it. Kahneman describes this quick switch to an available answer, in quite a bit of detail. Another interesting aspect is what he calls ""hedonic"" theory. Our memories of pleasant and unpleasant experiences are very much colored by their peak intensities and their ends--but definitely not by their durations. In other words, a short, very unpleasant experience is remembered as being much worse than an very long duration, unpleasant experience.Some of the explanations of our ways of thinking may seem basic and obvious if you have read other psychology books. But then you realize--Kahneman and his colleague Amos Tversky discovered these aspects of psychology, by conducting a wide variety of clever experiments. Very well written, and understandable to the non-specialist, I highly recommend this book to anybody interested in psychology."

14,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"Freeman “Dyson Sphere” Dyson wrote the New York Times review, which has me swooning right there. Dyson was a particularly apt pick because Kahneman helped design the Israeli military screening and training systems back when the country was young, and Dyson at 20 years old cranked statistics for the British Bombing Command in its youth. Dyson was part of a small group that figured out the bombers were wrong about what mattered to surviving night time raids over Germany; a thing only about a quarter of the crews did over a tour. Dyson figured out the Royal Airforce's theories about who lived and died were wrong. But no data driven changes were made because “the illusion of validity does not disappear just because facts prove it to be false. Everyone at Bomber Command, from the commander in chief to the flying crews, continued to believe in the illusion. The crews continued to die, experienced and inexperienced alike, until Germany was overrun and the war finally ended.” http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi... Why did the British military resist the changes? Because it was deeply inconsistent the heroic story of the RAF they believed in. Suppose there are stories I’d die for too. But not the myth that Kahneman dethroned. Kahneman got the Nobel Prize for Economics for showing that the Rational Man of Economics model of human decision making was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human decision making. We are not evolved to be rational wealth maximizers, and we systematically value and fear some things that should not be valued so highly or feared so much if we really were the Homo Economicus the Austrian School seems to think we should be. Which is personally deeply satisfying, because I never bought it and deeply unsettling because of how many decisions are made based on that vision. If that was all this book was, it’d just be another in a mass of books that have as their thesis “You’re wrong about that!” Which I appreciate knowing, but there’s a point where it’s a little eye rolling because they don’t offer any helpful suggestions on how not to be wrong, or why these patterns of wrongness exist and endure. But Kahneman has a theory. He theorizes that humans have two largely separate decision-making systems: System One (the fast) and System Two (the slow). System One let us survive monster attacks and have meaningful relationships with each other. System Two let us get to the moon. Both systems have values built into them and any system of decision-making that edits them out is doomed to undercut itself. Some specifics that struck me:Ideomotor Effect: (53) Concepts live in our heads in associative networks. Once triggered, they cascade concepts. Make someone walk slow, they think about old age. Make someone smile, and they’ll be happier. Seeing a picture of cash makes us more independent, more selfish, and less likely to pick up something someone else has dropped. Seeing a locker makes us more likely to vote for school bonds. Reminding people of their mortality makes them more receptive of authoritarian ideas.” (56) “Studies of priming effects have yielded discoveries that threaten our self-image as conscious and autonomous authors of our judgments and our choices.” (55). Halo Effect (82) “If you like the president’s politics, you probably like his voice and appearance as well.” We find someone attractive and we conclude they’re competent. We find emotional coherence pleasing and lack of coherence frustrating. However, far fewer things are correlated than we believe. What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI) (85). Our system one is pattern seeking. Our system 2 is lazy; happy to endorse system 1 beliefs without doing the hard math. “Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is so important to an understanding of intuitive thinking, and comes up so often in this book, that I will use a cumbersome abbreviation for it: WYSIATI. . . System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and quantity of information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions.” (86). Absolutely essentially for not getting eaten by lurking monsters, and “explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world. Much of the time, the coherent story we put together is close enough to reality to support reasonable action.” Except when it doesn’t. Like in our comparative risk assessments. We panic about shark attacks and fail to fear riptides; freak out about novel and unusual risks and opportunities and undervalue the pervasive ones. Answering an Easier Question (97). If one question is hard, we’ll substitute an easier one. It can be a good way to make decisions. Unless the easier question is not a good substitute. I have an uneasy awareness that I do this. Especially since it often REALLY ANNOYS me when people do it to me. The Law of Small Numbers. (109) The counties with the lowest level of kidney cancer are rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. Why? Good clean living? The counties with the highest level of kidney cancer are rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. Why? Lack of access to health care? Wait, what? The System 1 mind immediately comes up with a story to explain the difference. But once the numbers are cranked, apparently, it’s just an artifact of the fact that a few cases in a small county skews the rate. But if you base your decision on either story, the outcomes will be bad. Anchors (119). We seize on the first value offered, no matter how obviously absurd it is. If you want to push someone in a direction, get them to accept your anchor. Regression to the Mean. (175) There will be random fluctuations in the quality of performance. A teacher who praises a randomly good performance may shape behavior, but likely will simply be disappointed as statistics asserts itself and a bad performance follows. A teacher who criticizes a bad performance may incentivize, but likely will simply have a false sense of causation when statistics asserts itself and a good performance happens. Kahneman describes it as “a significant fact of the human condition: the feedback to which life exposes us too is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.” (176). The Illusion of Understanding (204) The sense-making machinery of System 1 makes us see the world as more tidy, simple, predictable, and coherent than it really is. The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the further illusion that one can control the future. These illusions are comforting. They reduce the anxiety that we would experience if we allowed ourselves to fully acknowledge the uncertainties of existence. We all have a need for the reassuring message that actions have appropriate consequences, and that success will reward wisdom and courage.” But it doesn’t . (212). For example, we’re totally wrong about whether you can beat the stock market. Formulas are often much more predictive than learned intuition. I’m going to have to wrestle with this one, but he alluded to a claim by Robyn Dawes that “marital stability is well predicted by a formula: frequency of lovemaking minus frequency of quarrels.” (226) Snicker. Premortems Can Help. (264) before making a decision, assign someone to imagine it’s a year into the future and the plan was a disaster. Have them write a history of the disaster. We value losses more than gains. (349) Which is fine except when that means we expose others to more risk because we did the math wrong. The Focusing Illusion (402) “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.” We overvalue what’s in our mind at the moment, which is subject to priming. He closes by stressing he does not mean to say that people are irrational. But, he says, “rational” in economic terms has a particular meaning that does not describe people. “For economists and decision theorists, [rationality] has an altogether different meaning. The only test of rationality is not whether a person’s beliefs and preferences are reasonable, but whether they are internally consistent. A rational person can believe in ghosts, so long as all her other beliefs are consistent with the existence of ghosts. . . . Rationality is logical coherence – reasonable or not. Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming evidence that Humans cannot be. . . . 	“The definition of rationality as coherence is impossibly restrictive; it demands adherence to rules of logic that a finite mind is not able to implement. Reasonable people cannot be rational by that definition, but they should not be branded as irrational for that reason. Irrational is a strong word, which connotes impulsivity, emotionality, and a stubborn resistance to reasoned argument. I often cringe when my work with Amos [Tversky] is credited with demonstrating that human choices are irrational, when in fact our research only showed that Humans are not well described by the rational-agent model.” (411) 	A good read."

Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.
I think this book is mistitled. For years, I assumed that it was some kind of self-help book about when to trust your gut and when to trust your head, and thus I put off reading it. But Thinking, Fast and Slow is nothing of the sort. As I finally discovered when the book was gifted to me (the ecstatic blurbs in the front pages were the first clue), this book is the summary of Daniel Kahneman’s study of cognitive errors. The book should probably be called: Thinking, Just Not Very Well.Granted, my initial impression had a grain of truth. Kahneman’s main focus is on what we sometimes call our gut. This is the “fast thinking” of the title, otherwise known as our intuition. Unlike many books on the market, which describe the wonders of human intuition and judgment, Kahneman’s primary focus was on how our intuition can systematically fail to draw correct conclusions. So you might say that this is a book about all of the reasons you should distrust your gut.Every researcher of the mind seems to divide it up into different hypothetical entities. For Freud it was the conscious and unconscious, while for Kahneman there are simply System 1 and System 2. The former is responsible for fast thinking—intuition, gut feelings—and the second is responsible for slow thinking—deliberative thought, using your head. System 2, while admirably thorough and logical, is also effortful and sluggish. Trying any unfamiliar mental task (such as mental arithmetic) can convince you of this. Thus, we must rely on our fast-acting System 1 for most of any given day.System 1 generates answers to questions without any experience of conscious deliberation. Most often these answers are reasonable, such as when answering the question “What you like a hamburger?” (Answer: yes). But, as Kahneman demonstrates, there are many situations in which the answer that springs suddenly to mind is demonstrably false. This would not be a problem if our conscious System 2 detected these falsehoods. Yet our default position is to simply go with our intuition unless we have a strong reason to believe our intuition is misleading. Unfortunately, the brain has no warning system to tell you that your gut feeling is apt to be unreliable. You can call these sorts of situations “cognitive illusions.”A common theme in these cognitive illusions is a failure of our intuition to deal with statistical information. We are good at thinking in terms of causes and comparisons, but situations involving chance throw us off. As an example, imagine a man who is shy, quiet, and orderly. Is he more likely to be a librarian or a farmer? Now consider the answer that springs to mind (librarian, I assume): how was it generated? Your mind compared the description to the stereotype of a librarian, and made the judgment. But this judgment did not take into account the fact that there are many times more farmers than male librarians.Another example of this failure of intuition is the mind’s tendency to generate causal stories to explain random statistical noise. A famous example of this is the “hot hand” in basketball: interpreting a streak of successful shots as due to the player being especially focused, rather than simply as a result a luck. (Although subsequent research has shown that there was something to the idea, after all. So maybe we should not lament too much about our intuitions!) Another well-known example is the tendency for traders to attribute their success or failure in the stock market to skill, while Kahneman demonstrated that the rankings of a group of traders from year to year had no correlation at all. The basic point is that we are generally hesitant to attribute something to chance, and instead invent causal stories that “explain” the variation.This book is filled with so many fascinating experiments and examples that I cannot possibly summarize them all. Suffice to say that the results are convincing, not only because of the weight of evidence, but mainly because Kahneman is usually able to demonstrate the principle at work on the reader. Our intuitive reactions are remarkably similar, apparently, and I found that I normally reacted to his questions in the way that he predicted. If you are apt to believe that you are a rational person (as I am) it can be quite depressing.After establishing the groundwork, Kahneman sets his sights on the neighboring discipline of economics. Conventional economic theory presupposes rational actors who are able to weigh risks and to act in accordance with their desires. But, as Kahneman found, this does hold with actual people. Not only do real humans act irrationally, but real humans deviate from the expected predictions of the rational agent model systematically. This means that we humans are (to borrow a phrase from another book in this vein) predictably irrational. Our folly is consistent.One major finding is that people are loss-averse. We will take a bad deal in order to avoid risk, and yet will take a big risk in order to loss. This behavior seems to be motivated by an intense fear of regret, and it is the cause of a certain amount of conservatism, not only in economics, but in life. If an action turns out badly, we tend to regret it more of it was an exceptional rather than a routine act (picking up a hitchhiker rather than driving to work, for example), and so people shy away from abnormal options that carry uncertainty.Yet, logically speaking, there is no reason to regret a special action more than a customary one, just as there is no reason to weigh losses so much more heavily than gains. Of course, there is good evolutionary logic for these tendencies. In a dangerous environment, losing a gamble could mean losing your life, so it is best to stay to the tried-and-true. But in an economic context, this strategy is not usually optimal.The last section of the book was the most interesting of all, at least from a philosophical perspective. Kahneman investigates how our memories systematically misrepresent our experiences, which can cause a huge divergence between experienced happiness and remembered joy. Basically, when it comes to memory, intensity matters more than duration, and the peaks and ends of experiences matter more than their averages. The same applies with pain: We may remember one experience as less painful than another just because the pain was mild when it ended. And yet, in terms of measured pain per minute, the first experience may actually have included more experiential suffering.As a result of this, our evaluations of life satisfaction can often have very little to do with our real, experiential well being. This presents us with something of a paradox, since we often do things, not for how much joy they will bring us in the moment, but for the nice memory they will create. Think about this: How much money would you spend on a vacation if you knew that every trace of the experience would be wiped out as soon as the vacation ended, including photos and even your memories? The answer for most people is not much, if anything at all. This is why so many people (myself included) frantically take photos on their vacations: the vacation is oriented toward a future remembering-self. But perhaps it is just as well that humans were made this way. If I made my decisions based on what was most pleasant to do in the moment, I doubt I would have made my way through Kant.This is just a short summary of the book, which certainly does not do justice to the richness of Kahneman’s many insights, examples, and arguments. What can I possibly add? Well, I think I should begin with my few criticisms. Now, it is always possible to criticize the details of psychological experiments—they are artificial, they mainly use college students, etc. But considering the logistical restraints of doing research, I thought that Kahneman’s experiments were all quite expertly done, with the relevant variables controlled and additional work performed to check for competing explanations. So I cannot fault this.What bothered me, rather, was that Kahneman was profuse in diagnosing cognitive errors, but somewhat reticent when it came to the practical ramifications of these conclusions, or to strategies to mitigate these errors. He does offer some consequences and suggestions, but these are few and far between. Of course, doing this is not his job, so perhaps it is unfair to expect anything of the kind from Kahneman. Still, if anyone is equipped to help us deal with our mental quagmires, he is the man.This is a slight criticism. A more serious shortcoming was that his model of the mind fails to account for a ubiquitous experience: boredom. According to Kahneman’s rough sketch, System 1 is pleased by familiarity, and System 2 is only activated (begrudgingly, and without much relish) for unfamiliar challenges. Yet there are times when familiarity can be crushing and when novel challenges can be wonderfully refreshing. The situation must be more subtle: I would guess that we are most happy with moderately challenging tasks that take place against a familiar background. In any case, I think that Kahneman overstated our intellectual laziness.Pop psychology—if this book can be put under that category—is a genre I dip into occasionally. Though there is a lot of divergence in emphasis and terminology, the consensus is arguably more striking. Most authors seem to agree that our conscious mind is rather impotent compared to all of the subconscious control exerted by our brains. Kahneman’s work in the realm of judgments closely parallels Johathan Haidt’s work in morals: that our conscious mind mostly just passively accepts verdicts handed up from our mental netherworld. Indeed, arguably this was Freud’s fundamental message, too. Yet it is so contrary to all of our conscious experiences (as, indeed, it must be) that it still manages to be slightly disturbing.Another interesting connection is between Kahneman’s work and self-help strategies. It struck me that these cognitive errors are quite directly related to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which largely consists of getting patients to spot their own mental distortions (most of which are due to our mind’s weakness with statistics) and correct them. And Kahneman’s work on experiential and remembered well being has obvious relevance to the mindfulness movement—strategies for switching our attention from our remembering to our experiencing “self.” As you can see from these connections, Kahneman’s research is awfully rich.Though perhaps not as amazing as the blurbs would have you believe, I cannot help but conclude that this is a thoroughly excellent book. Kahneman gathers many different strands of research together into a satisfying whole. Who would have thought that a book about all the ways that I am foolish would make me feel so wise?"

This is more the type of book you keep near your desk or bedside, read a 12 page chapter or so, and digest.

I've been working on this book since September or August (4-6 months) and just could not take reading it for more than a few minutes at a time. Many times did it put me to sleep. The book covered a lot of great material and really fascinating research, but oftentimes in such plodding, pedantic, meticulous detail as to nearly obfuscate the point. I have heard of the majority of the research (or at least their conclusions) as well, so while I thought it offered excellent insight and useful material for a lot of people to learn, I didn't think this collection of it--more of a history of the field than an introduction--added anything novel or unique for one already well-versed in the material. I guess I didn't care for the details in how the studies were conducted for every minor point in the author's theories--though I largely agreed with the theories and interpretations. A line near the end of the book struck a dissonant chord with me and I wonder if that offers an additional cause for my dislike: ""That was my reason for writing a book that is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than to decision makers."" I wouldn't count myself among 'decision makers' in any important sense (it's surprising how little responsibility a person can have sometimes!), but I often felt like the book wasn't speaking to me. Many times the author wrote ""we think..."" or ""we act..."" in such a way that I don't think I'd do. This isn't to say I'm a purely 'rational agent' or 'Econ' or anything like that--the majority of the authors theories (thinking can be either instinctual or effortful, rational agents act differently than emotional humans, and the experiencing self and the remembering self are different things) are immanently true--but I do think he was generalizing for a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) audience, and despite my background, I don't think I think that way. Recommendation: read the introduction and the conclusion (and perhaps the major section intros), cherry-pick anything else of interest. "

However, fast thinking, intuitive thinking, is more influential in what experience tells us he says---being contrary to the belief that we are very rational-decision making people. I still believe this book is incomplete ...I think their are other ways in speaking about the way our minds work - that is not found in this big book. However, Our author says we have two ways of thinking: (OK?/!).....1) Two basic systems of thinking:  System 1 is the intuitive, quick, thinking System 2 is the slowest rational logical and reflective thinking .....20% of our Energy goes into our brain. .....We tend to be lazy thinkers. ( lazy controller he calls it), and do not involve our slow thinking brain and less it is needed. ...... A running theme in the book is that although the brain does contain a statisticalalgorithm, it is not accurate. The brain does not understand basic normal distribution. ...... Our brain often jumps to conclusions. ...... Our brain knows how to answer easy questions, like ""what did you have for breakfast""?...but it is more challenging to answer the question, ""how do you feel about yourself today""?......We have biases...... Often stereotypes will override statistics. ( again providing we have influential, lazy judging brains) ....... He talks about predictions. For example, if a child gets great grades in the lower grades of school... We often tend to over estimate our ability to predict the future. ...... When it comes to intuition versus formulas ... Often the formula does win. ..... We also are incline to expect regularity much more in our lives and really exist. You won't find any data in this book about ""The Power of Now"" thinking, or discussion about ""You are not your Mind"", Chakras, or myths about healing ... but it's a book about THE WAY WE THINK... (technical.. some of it I resonated with- but when it got too scientifically technical, he lost me). I look forward to my book club discussion- 25 people will be attending this month- (many bright people)... I'm sure to gain value and more insights. "
20,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,2," Mr. Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner, explores the general subject of how and why we frequently make irrational decisions. We've all seen articles over the years on various aspects of this phenomenon, but I venture to say that never before have the various aspects and permutations been explored in this depth and specificity. Mr. Kahneman has spent much of his life researching the subject, and since the book includes both his research and that of others, it must stand as the definitive compendium on the subject. His credentials are indisputable, and he tries gamely to bring the subject to life, but -- mea culpa -- I just couldn't stay interested in the myriad of data and specific examples. The book is good for someone really interested in the details, and it does contain real life examples, but after 400 pages it's hard to remember them. My takeaway: Our intuition is frequently wrong, and even our experience (or what we believe our experience to have been) may not be reliable as a decision guide. So, be careful!"

23,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,4,"A long book that requires real mental exertion, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a worthwhile read by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman. It delves into the two complex systems of the mind. System 1 is impulsive, emotional, and often led astray, while System 2 is rational, thoughtful, and takes more time to makes decisions. He analyzes how humans use (and sometimes fail to use) both systems, and the resulting implications on topics ranging from how we perceive happiness to behavioral economics.Thinking, Fast and Slow is one of the most in-depth Psychology books I've read. I fell in love with the subject after taking AP Psychology last year as a junior in high school, and am currently craving more books and articles related to the field. Daniel Kahneman satisfied my thirst. I had a solid understanding of some concepts beforehand, like the confirmation bias and hindsight bias, but had never heard of other terms like base rate or the illusion of validity. The sheer amount of statistics and experiments referenced throughout the book proved Kahneman's thoroughness and dedication.I recommend Thinking, Fast and Slow to anyone who wants to learn about how we think, or about psychology in general. I liked how Kahneman progressed from simple ideas like heuristics to more complex concepts, like prospect theory. Even if you have no background in psychology or economics, a mere interest in either should suffice for this book.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."
24,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/741149-kalin,5,"I haven't felt so stimulated to re-think my thinking ever since I encountered Edward de Bono's books a dozen years ago. A text like this is especially instructive when you consider yourself an ""outside-the-norm"" person; it comes and beats you with a vengeance, time and again, as you try the mental problems inside for yourself--and fail and fail and fail. A lesson in humility, indeed. :)I was particularly happy to find out:- why a single quarrel can ruin a friendship of many years- what is the ratio of positive to negative experiences that makes us perceive a relationship as ""successful""- to what extent we weigh potential losses more than potential gains- how much and why we value our experiences: duration vs intensity- why we at the Human Library lost four fifths of our subscribers when we switched from an opt-out mailing list to an opt-in one... and on and on and on. The book is unusually compact and concrete.Definitely worth our time."
25,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,5,"I feel this book richly deserves its status. Kahneman has handed over the rich & surprising fruits of a lifetime of creative thought and research, in a well-organised book free of academiese (hurrah!) He also makes the material interactive by inviting us to do little mental activities to illustrate his simple study methods and assist the delight of recognition that makes this such an enjoyable read.One of his goals is to provide ways to talk about and tackle some everyday problems by considering the way we think as two interacting systems, and to point out the weaknesses and mistakes that arise from ways these tend to (co)operate. He frankly admits that it is easier to see others' sub-optimal performance than our own, and the tools he offers are generally for 'water-cooler talk' or gossiping about co-workers and negotiation partners. This is a lot better than it sounds, I promise!I would have to type out almost the entire book to share all the insights that impressed me, but I will pick out a few of my favourite themes:People use an 'availability heuristic' to make judgements about how often things occur - if you can think of a lot of examples of something, you tend to assume it is common. This makes us vulnerable to subtle propaganda techniques, and gives rise to an uncritical conflation of what-is-in-the-news with what-is-happening-in-the-world. Kahneman points out that we tend to ignore absent evidence: what-you-see-is-all-there-is (WYSIATI)People do not behave 'rationally' when faced with many types of wager that map onto real life decisions. Most people, in fact, behave in predictably irrational ways. Economic models that treat people as rational agents ('Econs') are deeply flawed. Which is a shame, because economists are using those modelsIntuition is not magic. People who are very experienced and highly trained have the ability to process sense data and make snap decisions before going through the laborious work of stringing verbal thoughts or calculations together. This works well in many situations: for firefighters, sportspeople, medics etc. However, there is a tendency to overinflate the importance of hunches and intuitions in other situations, particularly stock market trading, where Kahneman's statistical analysis shows that people (even experienced workers) are worse than computer programs, and even WORSE THAN RANDOM CHOICE at predicting and picking winners and losers.Perhaps especially in Euro-USian white culture, most of us tend to privilege our 'remembering self' over our 'experiencing self'. We tend to care disproportionately about the end of a story, and the ends of people's lives. People asked whether they would bother going on holiday if they had to have the memory of the holiday erased at the end of it often say they wouldn't. Kahneman's (very gentle!) experiments on pain showed that privileging the remembering self resulted in people choosing to experience MORE pain because of the way the experience was presented. He suggests that giving more thought to the experiencing self could improve life for many people. This echoes the concept of mindfulness that is important in some cultural traditions, therapies and religious practices. A friend pointed out that it was similar to Zen.So, that's your taster; I strongly recommend the whole smorgasbord. I'll definitely be reading this again."
26,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12086858-yousif-al-zeera,5,One of the best books I have ever read in my life (if not the best). It lays the foundation to unbiased approach to thinking. You need to have a look at how cognitive biases limits your thinking big time.
27,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"I could not bring myself to finish this book. The book is filled with shady experiments on undergraduates and psychology grad students and wild extrapolations of the associated results. I find it exceedingly difficult to take many of the conclusions seriously. I can't read into them. I can't trust them. I can't base my decisions on them and I resist incorporating them into my world view with anything more than 0.01 weight. In fact, several of the experiments that this book mentions were also found to be not reproducible by a recent meta-study on reproducibility in psychology studies.Here's a characteristic example of me reading the book. The author says: ""Consider the word EAT. Now fill in the blank in the following: SO_P. You were much more likely to fill in the blank with a U to make SOUP than with an A to make soap! How amazing. We call this phenomenon priming, system 1, something something"". In fact, no, SOAP came to my mind immediately.All I could think about when I read this book is my own experience of participating in a friend's psychology study once. He designed an experiment and asked me to do some things and answer some questions, but at some point it became extremely clear to me what the experiment was about, or how he hoped I would behave. I went along with it, but I couldn't believe that this would eventually become part of a paper. It was a joke. I'm afraid you can't go through a similar experience and take these studies seriously from then on.All that being said I do find the broad strokes of the system1/system2 division proposed in this book to be interesting and appealing. A small few of the examples were fun to contemplate, and it was okay. 3/5, aborting reading."

30,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965207-r-a-schneider,5,"In the last few years two books took me FOREVER to get through. The first was Daniel Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" and the second is Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" What caused this? What do they have in common? Both books explain, in minute detail, simple concepts with immensely far-reaching implications, and both have been... after the slog... the most intellectually rewarding reading of my adult life. Where to begin... I have a number of theories running around in my head, and occasionally I try to corral them on paper. I organize, sequence and interconnect them in a way that will prevent my reader from meaningfully widening their eyes, in an aside, while winding their finger around one ear... (""Cuckoo!"") Good writing about complex topics is very, very difficult, and Kahneman has corraled 30+ years of science, his career and all he has learned into a perfectly arranged sequence that leads the reader into a wilderness... provisioning you in each chapter with the tools you'll need for the next part of the journey.The second most striking effect on me is the number of times I said, ""Yes... YES!!! this is what I've been saying!"" In my case it has usually been some sort of ""intuitive""(excuse me, Mr. Kahneman... I mean ""System 1"") recognition of a pattern in my observations about the way we think. In Kahneman's case those intuitions have been converted into theoretical propositions, each meticulously researched in well designed experiments. Clearly, this is at least one difference between me and a Nobel Prize winning researcher.So why does this stuff matter? In the context of broader discussions of free will, intention, choice and control over the directions our lives take, this book can provide powerful insights that might currently be obscured by these ""cognitive illusions"" and the inherent limitations of ""System 1/System 2"" thinking. Perhaps we're not as ""free"" in our decisions as we might like to think, if ""priming"" has such a stunningly reproducible effect. Perhaps we're not so determined, if activities that initially require ""System 2"" attention, can be turned into second-nature, ""technical-expertise intuitions."" I.e. learning and training MATTERS in our ability to detect and respond to events that... if untrained... might take advantage of our brain's inherent ""blind spots"" or weaknesses. Perhaps childhood religious indoctrination is a very adept recognition of these mental tendencies/flaws, so profoundly (if intuitively/naively) expressed by Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order, ""Give me the boy until 7, I will give you the man."" (paraphrased; forgive me) Kahneman's discoveries and documentation of mental capacity and biases could form the basis of a ""Mental Martial Arts"" program: an alternative form of indoctrination, in which students are trained to understand their brains' weaknesses, and learn to take stances or engage in practices that eliminate or reduce the errors to which these weaknesses can lead. This book will rearrange the way you think... about how you think."
31,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671574-john,1,"An unrelentingly tedious book that can be summed up as follows. We are irrationally prone to jump to conclusions based on rule-of-thumb shortcuts to actual reasoning, and in reliance on bad evidence, even though we have the capacity to think our way to better conclusions. But we're lazy, so we don't. We don't understand statistics, and if we did, we'd be more cautious in our judgments, and less prone to think highly of our own skill at judging probabilities and outcomes. Life not only is uncertain, we cannot understand it systemically, and luck has just as much to do with what happens to us -- maybe even more -- than we care to admit. When in doubt, rely on an algorithm, because it's more accurate than your best guess or some expert's opinion. Above all, determine the baseline before you come to any decisions. If you like endless -- and I mean endless -- algebraic word problems and circuitous anecdotes about everything from the author's dead friend Amos to his stint with the Israeli Air Defense Force, if you like slow-paced, rambling explanations that rarely summarize a conclusion, if your idea of a hot date is to talk Bayesian theory with a clinical psychologist or an economist, then this book is for you, who are likely a highly specialized academically-inclined person. Perhaps you are even a blast at parties, I don't know. But if you're like me and you prefer authors to cut to the chase, make their point, and then leave you with a whopping big appendix if you're interested in the regression analysis of how many freshmen would watch a guy choke to death because they think someone else will come to the rescue, then this book is not for you.If you want to take the Reader's Digest pass through the book, then Chapter 1 and Section 3 are probably the most accessible and can be read in less than an hour, and still leave you with a fair understanding of the author's thesis."
32,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This is a fascinating book. Reading this book means not having to read so many others. For example, you could avoid having to read, Sway, Blink, Nudge and probably a dozen or so other books on Behavioural Economics. And the best part of it is that this is the guy (or, at least one half of the two guys) who came up with these ideas in the first place. I was thinking that perhaps the best way to explain those other books would be to compare them to Monty Python. I want you to imagine something - say you had spent your entire life and never actually seen an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. That wouldn't mean you wouldn't know anything about Monty Python. It is impossible to have lived at any time since the late 60s and not have had some socially dysfunctional male reprise the entire Parrot sketch or Spanish Inquisition sketch at you at some stage in your life. I suspect, although there is no way to prove this now, obviously, that Osama bin Laden could do the Silly Walk like a natural. Well, if you had never seen an episode of Monty Python and your entire experience of their work was via the interpretation of men of a certain age down the pub - then finally getting to see an episode of the original would be much the same effect as reading this book. Hundreds of people have already told all this guy's best stories in their own books - but all the same it is a pleasure to hear them again by the guy that first said, 'this parrot is dead' or rather, 'framing effects make fools of us all'.You need to read this book - but what is particularly good about it is that you come away from it knowing we really are remarkably easy to fool. It's because we think we know stuff that this comes as a constant surprise to us. Years ago I was talking to a guy who liked to bet. Everyone needs a hobby and that was his. Anyway, he told me he was playing two-up - an Australian betting game - and he realised something like tails hadn't come up frequently enough and so he started betting on tails and sure enough he made money. I told him that coins don't remember the last throw and so the odds of getting a tail was still 50%, as it had previously been. But I had no credibility - I'd already told him I never bet - so, how would I possibly know anything if I wasn't even brave enough to put my own money on the outcome? And didn't I understand the point of this story was he had already WON?Still, when faced with a series of coin flips that run - H, H, H, H, H, T, H, H, H - it does feel like tails are 'due'. This is the sort of mistake we are all too prone to make. The thing to remember is that while there is a law of large numbers - toss a coin often enough and in the very long run there will be as many heads turn up as tails - that isn't the case in the short run - where just about anything is possible.We (that is, we humans) are remarkably bad at mental statistics. And what makes it worse is that we are predictably bad at statistics. And this brings me to Bourdieu and him saying that Sociology is kind of martial art. He means that Sociology allows you to defend yourself from those who would manipulate you. Well, this book is the Bruce Lee book of advanced self-defence. Learning just how we fool ourselves might not make you feel terribly great about what it means to be human - but at least you will know why you hav stuffed up next time you do stuff up. I'm not sure it will stop you stuffing up - but that would be asking for an awful lot from one book.If you want the short version of this book, he has provided the two papers that probably got him the Nobel Prize - and they are remarkably clear, easy to understand and comprehensive. But look, read this book - it will do you good. "
33,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"I kind of want to cut this book in half, praise the first part, and stick the second part in some corner to gather dust. Not that the second part is bad, mind you; the entire book is well-written and obviously the product of someone who knows their field. There’s just a lot of it. Thinking, Fast and Slow is kind of like a guest who shows up to your party and then dazzles everyone with an impromptu, 15-minute oration on the geopolitical situation in South Ossetia; and, everyone applauds and turns to go back to their own conversations, only for the guest to launch into another story about the time they parachuted into the Balkans to break up a nascent civil war, a story which is followed quickly by a similar tale of a visit to Southeast Asia…. Well, I think you catch my drift. Daniel Kahneman spins an interesting tale of human psychology and the way our brains interpret and act on data. But the book overstays its welcome by a few hundred pages.Kahneman’s thesis breaks our decision-making systems into two pieces, System 1 and System 2, which are the respective “fast” and “slow” of the title. System 1 provides intuitive judgements based on stimulus we might not even be conscious of receiving; it’s the snap signals that we might not even know we are acting upon. System 2 is the more contemplative, cognitively taxing counterpart that we engage for serious mental exertion. Though often oppositional in the types of decisions they produce, Kahneman is keen to emphasize that it’s not about System 1 versus System 2. Instead, he’s out to educate us about how the interplay between these systems causes us to make decisions that aren’t always rational or sensible given the statistics and evidence at hand.Kahneman takes us through an exhaustive tour of biases and fallacies people are prone to making. He talks about the halo effect, affection bias, confirmation bias, and even regression to the mean. As a mathematician, I liked his angle on probability and statistics; as a logician, I appreciated his brief segues into the logical aspects of our contradictory decision-making processes. Lest I give the impression Kahneman gets too technical, however, I should emphasize that, despite its length, Thinking, Fast and Slow remains aggressively accessible. There are a few points where, if you don’t have a basic grasp of probability (and if Kahneman demonstrates anything, it’s that most people don’t), then you might feel talked over (or maybe it’s those less-than-infrequent, casual mentions of “and later I won a Nobel Prize”). But this book isn’t so much about science as it is about people.There are two other things I really appreciated about this book, both of which are related to psychology. I’m a fairly easygoing person, and I don’t always like to make waves, but sometimes I like to make some trouble and argue with some of my friends about whether psychology is a science. The problem for psychology is that it’s actually a rather broad term for a series of overlapping fields of investigation into human behaviour. On one end of this continuum, you have Freud and Jung and the various psychoanalysts who, let’s face it, are one step up from astrologers and palm-readers. On the other end, you have the cutting-edge cognitive psychology informed by the neuroscience of MRIs, split-brain studies, and rat research. So claiming that psychology is or isn’t a science is a little simplistic, and I’m willing to grant that there are areas within psychology that are science. For what it’s worth, Kahneman went a long way to reinforcing this: it’s clear he and his collaborators have done decades of extensive research. (Now, yes, it’s social science, but I won’t get into that particular snobbery today.)The other thing I liked about Thinking, Fast and Slow is its failure to mention evolutionary psychology. Once in a while, Kahneman alludes to System 1’s behaviour being the result of evolutionary adaptation—and that’s fine, because it is true, almost tautologically so. But he never quite delves into speculation about why such behaviour evolved, and I appreciate this. There’s a difference between identifying something as an adaptation and determining why it’s an adaptation, and I’m not a fan of evolutionary psychologists’ attempts to reduce everything to the trauma of trading trees for bipedalism … I’m willing to admit I have an ape brain, but culture must count for something, hmm?I suppose it’s also worth mentioning that this book reaffirms my supercilious disregard for economics. According to Kahneman, stock brokers and investors have no idea what they are doing—and some of them know this, but most of them don’t. Economists are, for the most part, highly-trained, but they seem bent upon sustaining this theoretical fantasy land in which humans are rational creatures. Aristotle aside, the data seem to say it isn’t so. I occasionally try my hand at reading books about the economy, just so I can say I did, but they usually end up going over my head. I’m a mathematician and I don’t get numbers—but at least I’m not the only one.So Thinking, Fast and Slow is genuinely interesting. I learned a lot from it. I would rate it higher, but I was starting to flag as I approached the finish line. Truth be told, I skipped the two articles Kahneman includes at the end that were the original publications about the theories he explains in the book. I’m sure they are fascinating for someone with more stamina, but at that point I just wanted to be done. That’s never good: one of the responsibilities of a non-fiction author is to know how to pace a book and keep its length appropriate. Too short and the book is unsatisfying—too long, and maybe it’s more so. And I think this flaw is entirely avoidable; it’s a result of Kahneman’s tendency to reiterate, to circle back around to the same discussions over and over again. He spends an entire chapter on prospect theory, then a few chapters later he’s telling us about its genesis all over again, just from a slightly different angle. Like that party guest, Kahneman is full of interesting stories, but after telling one after another for such a long period of time, it starts sounding like white noise. And he ate all those little cocktail snacks too.I inevitably ended up comparing Thinking, Fast and Slow to 
How We Decide
, a much slimmer volume along much the same lines as this one. Whereas Lehrer’s focus is on the neurology behind decision-making, Kahneman is more interested in the psychology. Both books boil down to: we suck at automatic decision-making when statistics are involved; therefore, we behave less rationally than we believe we do. Lehrer explains why things go wrong, and Kahneman categorizes all the different way things go wrong. In many ways the books are complementary, and if this is an area of interest for you, I’ll recommend them both. For the casual reader, however, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rather dense meal. By all means, give it a try, but take it slow.Also posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my reviews and subscribe to my digest newsletter.

34,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14972518-vijai,4,"If your objective, like it is when one finishes reading a self-help book, is to implement what Mr. Kahneman has to say in real life and benefit from it, I should warn you, you will be sorely disappointed. Believe it or not, in my opinion, I believe Mr. Kahneman is telling you exactly that in this book - that whether you like it or not, your entire life is guided or may I say decided by two fundamental ideas and that there is very little you can do to change it, period. Mr. Kahneman is probably the villain in every modern day spiritual guru's life, he argues very effectively that contrary to what these gurus may say the external world/ your environment/ surroundings/ or even society for that matter has a large say in your personal deliberate actions. You don't have a choice. So, having said that, shelving this book in psychology section would be gross injustice. In my view this is such a good commentary of human nature. The two are different, very much so. Read it, totally worth it in my opinion. Can get a little too drab but hang in there, this book is an eye opener."
35,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369435-jay-kamaladasa,5,"Hands down, one of the best books in its genre. The book is a lengthy, self-conscious and a challenging read but highly recommended if you're interested in why human beings behave the way they behave. It's given me so much 'oh snap, so that's why we're so dumb' moments that at this point I don't even want to admit I'm a human to any space-time traveling race that comes in collision of 21st century Earth.Citing behavioral research studies, he's convinced me that human confidence is a measure of whether a person has built up a coherent story not that the person truly knows what she's doing. He's convinced me that the feeling of 'ease' is just cognitive familiarity. He's convinced me why first impressions matter more than we think due to the Halo effect. He's convinced me that the human mind doesn't understand non-events. We think we understand the past, but we really don't. We create coherency by attributing causality to events, but not to non-events. In other words we underestimate the role of luck or the role of unknown variables in a given situation. He has given me reason to believe that in low validity environments, it's better to use formula's than to listen to expert human judgment. For example, the stability of a marriage can be better predicted by a simple equation like [stability = frequency of love making - frequency of arguing] than an expert opinion.But one of the most interesting hypothesis he builds up is the existence of two systems in the mind. System 1 is prone to cognitive biases described above, but it's also where morality comes from. Not to mention intuitive judgment and hueristic answers to life's everyday questions. Would you believe it? Morality is more of an intuitive thing than a logical and reasonable framework! And the funny thing is without system 1, we'd won't survive a day in the life. Not to mention we wouldn't act human. System 2 on the other hand is more introspective, rational and is capable of being aware of the cognitive biases created by System 1. If my understanding is correct then, we can replicate system 2 by a machine or artificial intelligence. But that machine will not have the same extent of morality that we have.... food for thought! In later chapters of the book, he describes another variation of duality in the human mind. An Experiencing Self and a Remembering Self. With countless examples (both experimental and anecdotal) he vividly paints a picture of how humans have this notion of ""I am my remembering self, and strangely my experiencing self is a stranger to me."" We're actually okay with letting our Experiencing Self suffer for the good of the Remembering Self!! This ties in to the cognitive bias of ""focusing Illusion"" (Focalism) and how we tend to overestimate a certain aspect of life. To put the icing on the cake he finalizes the book by analyzing how we appreciate, value and judge the quality of our lives with all these biases combined. And it's amazing how irrational we are in doing so. Not only have I realized from this book that I should stop worrying about societal standards (because they are mostly based on irrational biases) but that I should spend a significant amount of my time and effort to into creating a value structure ideally suited for myself. Now, only if I had bit more memory and cpu speed on System 2..."

It's being marketed as a book on psychology (and economic psychology, in particular) for the layperson. I'm not sure if other laypeople agree, but this wasn't really for me. And it's not that the prose is too technical (okay, sometimes it is) but rather that Kahneman is stuck somewhere between academic technicalities and clear expressive prose. Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

37,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"It is very difficult to judge, review or analyze a book that basically challenges the very idea of human “Rationalism”. Are humans perfectly rational? This dude, Daniel Kahneman, got a Nobel Prize in Economics for saying they are not. An ordinary person might have been treated with glare or a stinging slap if he said that to someone’s face. We simply don’t like being told that we are not very rational and certainly not as intelligent as we think we are. Hidden in the depths of our consciousness, are some ‘actors’ that keep tempering with our ‘rationality’. And we almost consciously allow this to happen. 	All in all, this book is a tour de force of Behavioral Psychology. Explaining how our mind comes to conclusions and makes decisions, Kahneman explains that our intuition and decision making part of brain has two personalities. These personalities, he says, are not two different or distinct systems but to understand them better, we will have to assign personalities not only to understand them better but also to be able to relate to them on a personal level. 	The two systems are called system 1 and system 2, for the sake of convenience. System 1 is vigilant, impulsive, judgmental, easily manipulated, highly emotional. System 2, on the other hand is the total opposite of system 1, it is very intelligent, indolent, mostly drowsing off in the back of our head, difficult to convince and extremely stubborn, and it only comes to action when there is some sort of ‘emergency’. Both these systems are susceptible to a number of biases, system 1 more than system 2.	I thought Kahneman would build up this narrative systematically but he goes on to give us a tour of his years of research, experiments and surveys exploring every nook of our conscious human mind. He focuses on a diverse set of heuristics and biases that influence our judgments in everyday life. With some brilliant experiments and survey reports, he convincingly elaborates the effects that these biases have on our decisions. Never forgetting to highlight the fallacies of our consciousness, he touches on a number of other important breakthroughs in the world of psychology. This is a very simple case of visual illusion where we see two lines of same size appearing to be of varying lengths. Even after knowing that they are equal and the illusion is created by the fins attached to them, our system 1 still impulsively signals that one of them is longer then the other. Through this simple illustration, he moves on to introduce Cognitive Illusions, which are more fascinating, and are drastically more effective.	Kahneman contends that it is extremely difficult to overcome heuristic biases. Although, through methods like using statistical formulas and deliberate scrutiny we can ‘rationalize’ our decisions to some extent. Still, we are inherently prone to fall for dazzling rhetoric and dashing figures, we believe in myths and incidents that are as improbable as they are ludicrous, because this is the way we see things. But this is not undesirable altogether, some of the intuitive abilities are an evolutionary blessing that help us understand emotions and make correct decision in split seconds. Neither does the author deems it expedient to overcome these biases, but only to recognize them and put our system 2 to work before making crucial judgments. 	 I am afraid that this review is getting a bit too long, and to be honest, I don’t think anyone reads long reviews.(Except some of my nerdy goodread friends who then leave an equally baffling Proustian comment, which of course, takes quite a while to be properly understood.) So I will mention a summary of some critical biases, ideas and psychological phenomenon that I found interesting. 	---------------------------------------------------------------I have attempted to summarize some heuristics, biases and psychological principle that I thought would make a fascinating introduction to tempt a novice like me to further explore the subject. They are just the tip of iceberg and not by any means exhaustive and just comprise a small part of what this book is all about. Associative machine: System 1 works in surprising ways, read this 			BANANA VOMIT Now, a lot happened in last few seconds when you read these two words. You wore an expression of disgust and a very bad image came to your mind, your body too reacted in disgust and for short time you might not want to eat bananas. All of this was automatic and beyond your control. It was “The Associative Machine” of system 1. We associate seemingly some unrelated images and with some imagination, form an image. Our brain loves patterns and some times it sees things that aren’t even there. A very interesting clip in which Simon Singh shows associative machine at work : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bG7E...Priming: Exposure to a word causes immediate changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen if you had just seen WASH.Similarly, exposure to an idea or event can also have similar temporary effect on our behavior. (“Florida Effect”)Cognitive Ease: We all love it when we don’t have to work too hard because system 2 doesn’t like being bothered. So we admire and rather look for cognitive ease. Things that are less complex have a positive effect on our behavior. Psychologists use the term “Mind at ease puts a smile on the face”. Similarly, smiling and laughing can also ease our mind (system 1) and make us feel confident and in control. Anything that is easy to understand (read or see) is likely to have a more positive effect on us as compared to anything that we have a hard time understanding or visualizing.Exposure Effect: We are more likely to choose the thing we are more familiar with. The principle that “Familiarity breeds liking” suggests that we are more inclined towards anything that is familiar and has been exposed to us before in past. The more the exposure is, the more we will be inclined towards it. This principle is excellently illustrated in Will Smith’s “Focus” (2015).a similar trick is used to con a billionaire. Normality illusion: Things that recur with greater frequency are considered normal, no matter how horrendous they are. Two people killed in a terrorist attack in a western country are more likely to be mourned then a hundreds of children killed in Gaza by a missile strike. Simply due to the fact that children in Gaze get bombed all the time, while a terrorist attack that kills innocents is sort of rarity in Europe and America. (The same concept is present in Orwell’s Animal Farm in which pigs start to dominate other animals and it becomes the norm after a while.)Substitution: If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it. For instance when asked How happy are you with your life these days? Its more likely that we don’t use a broad frame to answer the question and substitute it with a simpler question “What is my mood right now?”. System 1 can readily answer the substitute question but to answer the real question, System 2 would have to be excited, which as we know System 2 doesn’t like. In everyday life, we use this to avoid making decisions and expressions based on factual background and therefore make an impulsive and sometimes irrational comment to a difficult question.  What you see is there is: We take pride in our intuitive abilities which leads us to believe that we know the whole truth, no matter how fallible our sources are, and not withstanding the fact that there is always another side of the picture. When we hear a story or an incident, we tend to accept it as a fact without considering any view dissenting or contradicting it. Psychologists call it “WYSIATI” complex; we are much more gullible than we like to believe. But it is again the mischief of System 1 that leads us to believe a narrative impulsively and without further inquisition as to its authenticity. It is also another example of our intuitive tendency to see things in a narrow frame.Loss Aversion: Call it a gift of evolution or survival instinct, but we are naturally loss averse in most of our decisions. We are more likely to abandon a huge profit if there is some probability of an equally huge loss. We do want to have more, but not at the cost of putting our own at stake, we relish our possessions more than our desire to have more. Overconfidence and Hindsight bias: A general limitation of our mind is its imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge, or beliefs that have changed. Once you adopt a new view of the world (or any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed. We see people everyday saying that what just happened was what they always thought would happen and they, in their overconfidence, start believing that they always knew in hindsight that such an event was probable. (see Halo Effect) Prospect theory: This theory attempts to explain the way people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. Kahneman illustrates it through this graph This theory is one of his most important in the field of behavioral economics. Owing to its complexity, I can not summarize it here. P.S I highly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in Behavioral Psychology. Don’t waste your time on self-help books when you can read the real stuff."
38,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,4,"Often I find myself in conversations with people who are criminally opinionated, but have little in the way of empirical grounding. It’s common in these situations to hear them malign opponents of their views by reducing the conflict to a single factor; My opponent is so dumb they couldn’t hump a bacteria if they were a horny phage. Now, putting aside the fact that single factor analysis is a mugs game when discussing things of any complexity (which is basically everything), when resorting to these oversimplifications with human behavior, you asymptotically approach infinite incorrectness. My common refrain in these times is to dip into my quote bag and castigate the misguided with Popper’s glib witticism: “A theory that explains everything, explains nothing.” Or, channeling the Arch Bishop of astuteness, John Stuart Mill, I rise up, gesturing dramatically and pitching my voice just so: “He who knows only his side of the case knows little of that.” Hoping their snotty self assurance will recede before my rational indignation like an anabolic hairline.This shit never works. Putting aside the fact that I’m subject to the same cognitive limitations, quotations often arrive on the scene like a flaccid member, with intimations of a proper impression hidden somewhere in that bloodless noodle, if only the other party would play with it. But, much like idioms, there’s just not enough chemistry to warrant heavy petting.Next I will resort to recalling numerous studies which have totally pin-cushioned the quaint notion that we are dispassionate, logical thinkers. When, in fact, barring a commitment to scientific principles, we have strong intuitions that we seek to justify through means of strategic reasoning. “We’re more like lawyers than Vulcans.” I say solemnly. Starring off into the distance for dramatic effect. Pensive. Avoiding eye contact for an appropriate interval before turning to peer into their soul and nod as we grasp, however tenuously, our feeble position before the Logos. Inevitably, when this numinous moment arrives, I am instead greeted with a vacant stare, or, much worse, an objection! Which, if you’ve been following me so far, means that I switch from attempting to persuade and instead silently chide my opponent for being a hopeless imbecile.How do we opt out of being unrelenting self righteous pricks? Well, we probably can’t fully, the gravity is just too strong. Escape velocity would require some fundamental redesigns to a cognitive apparatus which evolved to intuit a subset of phenomena on the African savanna which bore a relationship to our reproductive success. But we can sure as hell beat one another with books like this until we piss blood and can’t hold our toothbrushes due to nasty rotator cuff injuries. That’ll teach us. I consider this to be the Mac Daddy of bibliophilic bludgeoning implements on this topic. I once blasted a man in the chest so hard with the spine of this book that, in addition to the bastard rolling clean over a Pizza Hut table like it was the hood of a speeding vehicle, the pages burst from between the covers like a fox vomiting hen feathers. So incensed by this needless destruction of literary property, I stood over the man and berated him on the importance of properly breaking in the spines of hardcovers. As he wormed about in pepperoni and soda, nodding (if for no other reason than to avoid another terrible sounding of his sternum) I also took the time to explain the central message of this book:“Look, man. You need to realize that we’ve got these two modes of cognition. One is accessible to us. It’s slow and deliberative and subject to systematic interventions of logic if we but choose to learn and apply them. The other does pretty much whatever it damn well pleases based on input it receives from the environment that you’re often not consciously aware of. It’s good when it’s helping you get out of the way of deranged book wielders, but it’s bad when it goes awry in matters that are deeply counter intuitive (much of modern life) and mucks about with your ability to properly steer the system you have access to.”This is an important book. Humanity would be much improved if these insights could percolate through society and really take hold. But they probably won’t. Because we’re assholes."

I'm leaving it out in the living room for now, though--for refreshers.The author's aim is to prove to us that we are not rational beings to the extent we think we are, that evolution has seen to that. And that being the case, the book outlines what we need to know so as not to mess up decisions like we have been doing--like we all do. And he's made it accessible. He pulls you in. You will get your share of ""Aha!"" moments. You can read it at whatever level you want. You can skim over the more complicated parts and go for the pithy conclusions. Or if you are really into the science and scholarship, there are footnotes in the back--stealth footnotes without the little numbers on the book's pages, so as not to intimidate the general audience. All based on science. It's true whether you like it or not. And it is applicable to your life. You can't go over it, you can't go under it, so go through it--with this book.

40,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"This book had me laughing and smiling, more than many a book described in its blurb as side-splittingly funny or something similar because I recognised the cognitive disillusions described in this book as my own and in any case I am the kind of person who if they fall into a good mood wonders if it's due to the pint and the pie that was eaten earlier.In my case the preacher wasn't talking to the choir, but I had been to the church before and enjoyed the services. It doesn't set out to be a new book full of new discoveries. It's a comfortable round up of research, investigations and thought, polished off with a couple of Kahneman's early articles as appendices. If you've read The Halo Effect ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers(which puts some of these cogitative delusions in a business context, it has an excellent anecdote about the failure of a Lego product), or something along those lines you'll be familiar with some of the ideas here.By now I'm quite comfortable accepting that I am not rational and that other people aren't either and that statistical thinking is alien to probably to almost everybody and Kahneman's book happily confirms my opinion. And few things make us as happy as having our own biases confirmed to us.There are however a couple of problems. Firstly there are some people who apparently are wedded to the notion that people are entirely rational. They either will not read this book, read and reject it or indeed read it, accept it's findings but mentally note them as curious aberrations that don't affect their belief - this is discussed in the book.More seriously society is organised on the tacit assumption that we are not only capable of being rational but will put the effort into doing so when required. Unfortunately studies demonstrating the effect of meals on Judges reviewing parole cases (like the state pawn broker in Down and out in Paris and London they are more lenient after lunch and harsher beforehand and once they get hungry again) or voter behaviour which turns out to be influenced by where the polling booth is located. This makes me wonder. My polling station used to be in the Adult Education Centre, now that's been closed down, if the polling centre was moved to the police station would my voting habits transform into those of a Fishin', Huntin' and Floggin' Tory who froths at the mouth hearing the words 'illegal immigrants'? Maybe I need a snack. Much in the book is useful, 90% fat free does sound better than 10% fat, there's a lot to be learnt here in how to describe or state a problem to push people towards certain responses by framing or anchoring the information you give. Of course this happens to us all the time as it is. One of my favourite of Kahneman's examples comes from when he was working with Israeli flight instructors. They were convinced that shouting and swearing at trainee pilots was the best method of improving their performance - experience proved it - when a pilot under performed they swore at him and on the next attempt the trainee would do better. Plainly shouting works. Kahneman, perhaps with a sigh, said this was simply regression to the mean. After poor performance what ever they did would be followed by improved performance, swearing and shouting have no magic power. To demonstrate he had the instructors throw balls of paper over their shoulder's into a waste paper bin and tracked the results on a handy black board showing that performance varied up and down irrespective of swearing. Still I wonder if returning to work the instructors developed an enlightened instruction method or if they rapidly regressed to the mean and shouted and swore again.I used to think that politicians answered a different question to the one given by the interviewer in an attempt to be evasive. Post Kahneman I wonder if this is just the natural tendency of the brain to substitute an easier question for a harder one. Who knows. "
41,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an excellent book about how we think, written by a Nobel-prize-winning economist. Kahneman explains how two ""systems"" in the mind make decisions. ""System 1"" is the fast, intuitive aspect of the mind. ""System 2"" is the slower, logical and reasoning part of the mind. We generally make decisions quickly with the System 1, often because System 2 is simply--lazy. It takes effort to think things out rationally, and our rational minds are not always up to the job. This book is a long, comprehensive explanation of why we make decisions the way we do. Both systems are necessary, but both are subject to fallacies. Kahneman explains many of these fallacies. Most people do not really understand probability, so we are not good at judging relative levels of risk. Our decisions are strongly colored by how we frame questions in our minds. Simply re-framing a question can easily cause people--even professionals like doctors--to reverse decisions. We need to understand these framing issues, to avoid bad decisions. Elements of causality and Bayesian probability are described in some detail.One of the most interesting aspects of the ways we think, is the concept of availability. Often, when subjected to a difficult question, we answer immediately. But really, we do not answer the question at hand--we have made a subtle switch to a simpler question, without even realizing it. Kahneman describes this quick switch to an available answer, in quite a bit of detail. Another interesting aspect is what he calls ""hedonic"" theory. Our memories of pleasant and unpleasant experiences are very much colored by their peak intensities and their ends--but definitely not by their durations. In other words, a short, very unpleasant experience is remembered as being much worse than an very long duration, unpleasant experience.Some of the explanations of our ways of thinking may seem basic and obvious if you have read other psychology books. But then you realize--Kahneman and his colleague Amos Tversky discovered these aspects of psychology, by conducting a wide variety of clever experiments. Very well written, and understandable to the non-specialist, I highly recommend this book to anybody interested in psychology."

I had already pre- judged it before I started reading... ( certain I would discover I'm a FAST INTUITIVE - type thinker ... ( quick, often influenced by emotion). Once in awhile I use basic common sense - logic .... but even, it is usually with 'righteous emotions'. Just being honest!I understand this is an intellectual -giant- of - a -book about ""How we think""...Thinking 'deeply' about how we think... but this book hasn't changed me - transformed me--or enlighten me. Not so far. It's too technical. I understand the author is brilliant --but I found myself skimming pages-- However, what I understood - I enjoyed. Kahneman has a great talent at being a slow, rational, logical, and reflective thinker. However, fast thanking, intuitive thinking, is more influential in what experience tells us he says---being contrary to the belief that we are very rational-decision making people. A few things in the book...interesting information ... Yet I still 'believe it's incomplete ...That their are other ways in speaking about the way our minds work - that is not found in this big book. 1) Two basic systems of thinking:  System 1 is the intuitive, quick, thinking System 2 is the slowest rational logical and reflective thinking .....20% of our Energy goes into our brain. .....We tend to be lazy thinkers. ( lazy controller he calls it), and do not involve our slow thinking brain and less it is needed. ...... A running theme in the book is that although the brain does contain a statisticalalgorithm, it is not accurate. The brain does not understand basic normal distribution. ...... Our brain often jumps to conclusions. ...... Our brain knows how to answer easy questions, like ""what did you have for breakfast""?...but it is more challenging to answer the question, ""how do you feel about yourself today""?......We have biases...... Often stereotypes will override statistics. ( again providing we have influential, lazy judging brains) ....... He talks about predictions. For example, if a child gets great grades in the lower grades of school... We often tend to over estimate our ability to predict the future. ...... When it comes to intuition versus formulas ... Often the formula does win. ..... We also are incline to expect regularity much more in our lives and really exist. You won't find any data in this book about ""The Power of Now"" thinking, or discussion about ""You are not your Mind"", Chakras, or myths about healing ... but it's a book about THE WAY WE THINK...

I look forward to my book club discussion- 25 people will be attending this month- (many bright people)... I'm sure to gain value and more insights. "
44,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"Freeman “Dyson Sphere” Dyson wrote the New York Times review, which has me swooning right there. Dyson was a particularly apt pick because Kahneman helped design the Israeli military screening and training systems back when the country was young, and Dyson at 20 years old cranked statistics for the British Bombing Command in its youth. Dyson was part of a small group that figured out the bombers were wrong about what mattered to surviving night time raids over Germany; a thing only about a quarter of the crews did over a tour. Dyson figured out the Royal Airforce's theories about who lived and died were wrong. But no data driven changes were made because “the illusion of validity does not disappear just because facts prove it to be false. Everyone at Bomber Command, from the commander in chief to the flying crews, continued to believe in the illusion. The crews continued to die, experienced and inexperienced alike, until Germany was overrun and the war finally ended.” http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi... Why did the British military resist the changes? Because it was deeply inconsistent the heroic story of the RAF they believed in. Suppose there are stories I’d die for too. But not the myth that Kahneman dethroned. Kahneman got the Nobel Prize for Economics for showing that the Rational Man of Economics model of human decision making was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human decision making. We are not evolved to be rational wealth maximizers, and we systematically value and fear some things that should not be valued so highly or feared so much if we really were the Homo Economicus the Austrian School seems to think we should be. Which is personally deeply satisfying, because I never bought it and deeply unsettling because of how many decisions are made based on that vision. If that was all this book was, it’d just be another in a mass of books that have as their thesis “You’re wrong about that!” Which I appreciate knowing, but there’s a point where it’s a little eye rolling because they don’t offer any helpful suggestions on how not to be wrong, or why these patterns of wrongness exist and endure. But Kahneman has a theory. He theorizes that humans have two largely separate decision-making systems: System One (the fast) and System Two (the slow). System One let us survive monster attacks and have meaningful relationships with each other. System Two let us get to the moon. Both systems have values built into them and any system of decision-making that edits them out is doomed to undercut itself. Some specifics that struck me:Ideomotor Effect: (53) Concepts live in our heads in associative networks. Once triggered, they cascade concepts. Make someone walk slow, they think about old age. Make someone smile, and they’ll be happier. Seeing a picture of cash makes us more independent, more selfish, and less likely to pick up something someone else has dropped. Seeing a locker makes us more likely to vote for school bonds. Reminding people of their mortality makes them more receptive of authoritarian ideas.” (56) “Studies of priming effects have yielded discoveries that threaten our self-image as conscious and autonomous authors of our judgments and our choices.” (55). Halo Effect (82) “If you like the president’s politics, you probably like his voice and appearance as well.” We find someone attractive and we conclude they’re competent. We find emotional coherence pleasing and lack of coherence frustrating. However, far fewer things are correlated than we believe. What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI) (85). Our system one is pattern seeking. Our system 2 is lazy; happy to endorse system 1 beliefs without doing the hard math. “Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is so important to an understanding of intuitive thinking, and comes up so often in this book, that I will use a cumbersome abbreviation for it: WYSIATI. . . System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and quantity of information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions.” (86). Absolutely essentially for not getting eaten by lurking monsters, and “explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world. Much of the time, the coherent story we put together is close enough to reality to support reasonable action.” Except when it doesn’t. Like in our comparative risk assessments. We panic about shark attacks and fail to fear riptides; freak out about novel and unusual risks and opportunities and undervalue the pervasive ones. Answering an Easier Question (97). If one question is hard, we’ll substitute an easier one. It can be a good way to make decisions. Unless the easier question is not a good substitute. I have an uneasy awareness that I do this. Especially since it often REALLY ANNOYS me when people do it to me. The Law of Small Numbers. (109) The counties with the lowest level of kidney cancer are rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. Why? Good clean living? The counties with the highest level of kidney cancer are rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. Why? Lack of access to health care? Wait, what? The System 1 mind immediately comes up with a story to explain the difference. But once the numbers are cranked, apparently, it’s just an artifact of the fact that a few cases in a small county skews the rate. But if you base your decision on either story, the outcomes will be bad. Anchors (119). We seize on the first value offered, no matter how obviously absurd it is. If you want to push someone in a direction, get them to accept your anchor. Regression to the Mean. (175) There will be random fluctuations in the quality of performance. A teacher who praises a randomly good performance may shape behavior, but likely will simply be disappointed as statistics asserts itself and a bad performance follows. A teacher who criticizes a bad performance may incentivize, but likely will simply have a false sense of causation when statistics asserts itself and a good performance happens. Kahneman describes it as “a significant fact of the human condition: the feedback to which life exposes us too is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.” (176). The Illusion of Understanding (204) The sense-making machinery of System 1 makes us see the world as more tidy, simple, predictable, and coherent than it really is. The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the further illusion that one can control the future. These illusions are comforting. They reduce the anxiety that we would experience if we allowed ourselves to fully acknowledge the uncertainties of existence. We all have a need for the reassuring message that actions have appropriate consequences, and that success will reward wisdom and courage.” But it doesn’t . (212). For example, we’re totally wrong about whether you can beat the stock market. Formulas are often much more predictive than learned intuition. I’m going to have to wrestle with this one, but he alluded to a claim by Robyn Dawes that “marital stability is well predicted by a formula: frequency of lovemaking minus frequency of quarrels.” (226) Snicker. Premortems Can Help. (264) before making a decision, assign someone to imagine it’s a year into the future and the plan was a disaster. Have them write a history of the disaster. We value losses more than gains. (349) Which is fine except when that means we expose others to more risk because we did the math wrong. The Focusing Illusion (402) “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.” We overvalue what’s in our mind at the moment, which is subject to priming. He closes by stressing he does not mean to say that people are irrational. But, he says, “rational” in economic terms has a particular meaning that does not describe people. “For economists and decision theorists, [rationality] has an altogether different meaning. The only test of rationality is not whether a person’s beliefs and preferences are reasonable, but whether they are internally consistent. A rational person can believe in ghosts, so long as all her other beliefs are consistent with the existence of ghosts. . . . Rationality is logical coherence – reasonable or not. Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming evidence that Humans cannot be. . . . 	“The definition of rationality as coherence is impossibly restrictive; it demands adherence to rules of logic that a finite mind is not able to implement. Reasonable people cannot be rational by that definition, but they should not be branded as irrational for that reason. Irrational is a strong word, which connotes impulsivity, emotionality, and a stubborn resistance to reasoned argument. I often cringe when my work with Amos [Tversky] is credited with demonstrating that human choices are irrational, when in fact our research only showed that Humans are not well described by the rational-agent model.” (411) 	A good read."

I think this book is mistitled. For years, I assumed that it was some kind of self-help book about when to trust your gut and when to trust your head, and thus I put off reading it. But Thinking, Fast and Slow is nothing of the sort. As I finally discovered when the book was gifted to me (the ecstatic blurbs in the front pages were the first clue), this book is the summary of Daniel Kahneman’s study of cognitive errors. The book should probably be called: Thinking, Just Not Very Well.Granted, my initial impression had a grain of truth. Kahneman’s main focus is on what we sometimes call our gut. This is the “fast thinking” of the title, otherwise known as our intuition. Unlike many books on the market, which describe the wonders of human intuition and judgment, Kahneman’s primary focus was on how our intuition can systematically fail to draw correct conclusions. So you might say that this is a book about all of the reasons you should distrust your gut.Every researcher of the mind seems to divide it up into different hypothetical entities. For Freud it was the conscious and unconscious, while for Kahneman there are simply System 1 and System 2. The former is responsible for fast thinking—intuition, gut feelings—and the second is responsible for slow thinking—deliberative thought, using your head. System 2, while admirably thorough and logical, is also effortful and sluggish. Trying any unfamiliar mental task (such as mental arithmetic) can convince you of this. Thus, we must rely on our fast-acting System 1 for most of any given day.System 1 generates answers to questions without any experience of conscious deliberation. Most often these answers are reasonable, such as when answering the question “What you like a hamburger?” (Answer: yes). But, as Kahneman demonstrates, there are many situations in which the answer that springs suddenly to mind is demonstrably false. This would not be a problem if our conscious System 2 detected these falsehoods. Yet our default position is to simply go with our intuition unless we have a strong reason to believe our intuition is misleading. Unfortunately, the brain has no warning system to tell you that your gut feeling is apt to be unreliable. You can call these sorts of situations “cognitive illusions.”A common theme in these cognitive illusions is a failure of our intuition to deal with statistical information. We are good at thinking in terms of causes and comparisons, but situations involving chance throw us off. As an example, imagine a man who is shy, quiet, and orderly. Is he more likely to be a librarian or a farmer? Now consider the answer that springs to mind (librarian, I assume): how was it generated? Your mind compared the description to the stereotype of a librarian, and made the judgment. But this judgment did not take into account the fact that there are many times more farmers than male librarians.Another example of this failure of intuition is the mind’s tendency to generate causal stories to explain random statistical noise. A famous example of this is the “hot hand” in basketball: interpreting a streak of successful shots as due to the player being especially focused, rather than simply as a result a luck. (Although subsequent research has shown that there was something to the idea, after all. So maybe we should not lament too much about our intuitions!) Another well-known example is the tendency for traders to attribute their success or failure in the stock market to skill, while Kahneman demonstrated that the rankings of a group of traders from year to year had no correlation at all. The basic point is that we are generally hesitant to attribute something to chance, and instead invent causal stories that “explain” the variation.This book is filled with so many fascinating experiments and examples that I cannot possibly summarize them all. Suffice to say that the results are convincing, not only because of the weight of evidence, but mainly because Kahneman is usually able to demonstrate the principle at work on the reader. Our intuitive reactions are remarkably similar, apparently, and I found that I normally reacted to his questions in the way that he predicted. If you are apt to believe that you are a rational person (as I am) it can be quite depressing.After establishing the groundwork, Kahneman sets his sights on the neighboring discipline of economics. Conventional economic theory presupposes rational actors who are able to weigh risks and to act in accordance with their desires. But, as Kahneman found, this does hold with actual people. Not only do real humans act irrationally, but real humans deviate from the expected predictions of the rational agent model systematically. This means that we humans are (to borrow a phrase from another book in this vein) predictably irrational. Our folly is consistent.One major finding is that people are loss-averse. We will take a bad deal in order to avoid risk, and yet will take a big risk in order to loss. This behavior seems to be motivated by an intense fear of regret, and it is the cause of a certain amount of conservatism, not only in economics, but in life. If an action turns out badly, we tend to regret it more of it was an exceptional rather than a routine act (picking up a hitchhiker rather than driving to work, for example), and so people shy away from abnormal options that carry uncertainty.Yet, logically speaking, there is no reason to regret a special action more than a customary one, just as there is no reason to weigh losses so much more heavily than gains. Of course, there is good evolutionary logic for these tendencies. In a dangerous environment, losing a gamble could mean losing your life, so it is best to stay to the tried-and-true. But in an economic context, this strategy is not usually optimal.The last section of the book was the most interesting of all, at least from a philosophical perspective. Kahneman investigates how our memories systematically misrepresent our experiences, which can cause a huge divergence between experienced happiness and remembered joy. Basically, when it comes to memory, intensity matters more than duration, and the peaks and ends of experiences matter more than their averages. The same applies with pain: We may remember one experience as less painful than another just because the pain was mild when it ended. And yet, in terms of measured pain per minute, the first experience may actually have included more experiential suffering.As a result of this, our evaluations of life satisfaction can often have very little to do with our real, experiential well being. This presents us with something of a paradox, since we often do things, not for how much joy they will bring us in the moment, but for the nice memory they will create. Think about this: How much money would you spend on a vacation if you knew that every trace of the experience would be wiped out as soon as the vacation ended, including photos and even your memories? The answer for most people is not much, if anything at all. This is why so many people (myself included) frantically take photos on their vacations: the vacation is oriented toward a future remembering-self. But perhaps it is just as well that humans were made this way. If I made my decisions based on what was most pleasant to do in the moment, I doubt I would have made my way through Kant.This is just a short summary of the book, which certainly does not do justice to the richness of Kahneman’s many insights, examples, and arguments. What can I possibly add? Well, I think I should begin with my few criticisms. Now, it is always possible to criticize the details of psychological experiments—they are artificial, they mainly use college students, etc. But considering the logistical restraints of doing research, I thought that Kahneman’s experiments were all quite expertly done, with the relevant variables controlled and additional work performed to check for competing explanations. So I cannot fault this.What bothered me, rather, was that Kahneman was profuse in diagnosing cognitive errors, but somewhat reticent when it came to the practical ramifications of these conclusions, or to strategies to mitigate these errors. He does offer some consequences and suggestions, but these are few and far between. Of course, doing this is not his job, so perhaps it is unfair to expect anything of the kind from Kahneman. Still, if anyone is equipped to help us deal with our mental quagmires, he is the man.This is a slight criticism. A more serious shortcoming was that his model of the mind fails to account for a ubiquitous experience: boredom. According to Kahneman’s rough sketch, System 1 is pleased by familiarity, and System 2 is only activated (begrudgingly, and without much relish) for unfamiliar challenges. Yet there are times when familiarity can be crushing and when novel challenges can be wonderfully refreshing. The situation must be more subtle: I would guess that we are most happy with moderately challenging tasks that take place against a familiar background. In any case, I think that Kahneman overstated our intellectual laziness.Pop psychology—if this book can be put under that category—is a genre I dip into occasionally. Though there is a lot of divergence in emphasis and terminology, the consensus is arguably more striking. Most authors seem to agree that our conscious mind is rather impotent compared to all of the subconscious control exerted by our brains. Kahneman’s work in the realm of judgments closely parallels Johathan Haidt’s work in morals: that our conscious mind mostly just passively accepts verdicts handed up from our mental netherworld. Indeed, arguably this was Freud’s fundamental message, too. Yet it is so contrary to all of our conscious experiences (as, indeed, it must be) that it still manages to be slightly disturbing.Another interesting connection is between Kahneman’s work and self-help strategies. It struck me that these cognitive errors are quite directly related to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which largely consists of getting patients to spot their own mental distortions (most of which are due to our mind’s weakness with statistics) and correct them. And Kahneman’s work on experiential and remembered well being has obvious relevance to the mindfulness movement—strategies for switching our attention from our remembering to our experiencing “self.” As you can see from these connections, Kahneman’s research is awfully rich.Though perhaps not as amazing as the blurbs would have you believe, I cannot help but conclude that this is a thoroughly excellent book. Kahneman gathers many different strands of research together into a satisfying whole. Who would have thought that a book about all the ways that I am foolish would make me feel so wise?"
46,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32271-jeff-raymond,0,"My issue with this book, which is one I've tossed aside after 60 pages, is not so much that it's poorly done or that it's hard to understand - in fact, the exact opposite is true.The issue is that this book is simply more in depth about psychology and psychological processes than I truly have a short-term interest in. This is more the type of book you keep near your desk or bedside, read a 12 page chapter or so, and digest. This may be a book I need to own and do that with as opposed to tear through it after borrowing it from the library and then hating myself as a slog through it."

I've been working on this book since September or August (4-6 months) and just could not take reading it for more than a few minutes at a time. Many times did it put me to sleep. The book covered a lot of great material and really fascinating research, but oftentimes in such plodding, pedantic, meticulous detail as to nearly obfuscate the point. I have heard of the majority of the research (or at least their conclusions) as well, so while I thought it offered excellent insight and useful material for a lot of people to learn, I didn't think this collection of it--more of a history of the field than an introduction--added anything novel or unique for one already well-versed in the material. I guess I didn't care for the details in how the studies were conducted for every minor point in the author's theories--though I largely agreed with the theories and interpretations. A line near the end of the book struck a dissonant chord with me and I wonder if that offers an additional cause for my dislike: ""That was my reason for writing a book that is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than to decision makers."" I wouldn't count myself among 'decision makers' in any important sense (it's surprising how little responsibility a person can have sometimes!), but I often felt like the book wasn't speaking to me. Many times the author wrote ""we think..."" or ""we act..."" in such a way that I don't think I'd do. This isn't to say I'm a purely 'rational agent' or 'Econ' or anything like that--the majority of the authors theories (thinking can be either instinctual or effortful, rational agents act differently than emotional humans, and the experiencing self and the remembering self are different things) are immanently true--but I do think he was generalizing for a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) audience, and despite my background, I don't think I think that way. Recommendation: read the introduction and the conclusion (and perhaps the major section intros), cherry-pick anything else of interest. "

I had already pre- judged it before I started reading... ( certain I would discover I'm a FAST INTUITIVE - type thinker ... ( quick, often influenced by emotion). Once in awhile I use basic common sense - logic --(not often)--just being honest! I rather trust my gut! I understand this is an intellectual -giant- of - a -book about ""How we think"".""Thinking deeply about how we think"", hasn't changed me, transformed me,or enlighten me. Not so far. This book is pretty technical. I understand the author is brilliant --but I found myself skimming pages-- However, what I understood - I did enjoy. Kahneman has a great talent at being a slow, rational, logical, and reflective thinker. However, fast thinking, intuitive thinking, is more influential in what experience tells us he says---being contrary to the belief that we are very rational-decision making people. I still believe this book is incomplete ...I think their are other ways in speaking about the way our minds work - that is not found in this big book. However, Our author says we have two ways of thinking: (OK?/!).....1) Two basic systems of thinking:  System 1 is the intuitive, quick, thinking System 2 is the slowest rational logical and reflective thinking .....20% of our Energy goes into our brain. .....We tend to be lazy thinkers. ( lazy controller he calls it), and do not involve our slow thinking brain and less it is needed. ...... A running theme in the book is that although the brain does contain a statisticalalgorithm, it is not accurate. The brain does not understand basic normal distribution. ...... Our brain often jumps to conclusions. ...... Our brain knows how to answer easy questions, like ""what did you have for breakfast""?...but it is more challenging to answer the question, ""how do you feel about yourself today""?......We have biases...... Often stereotypes will override statistics. ( again providing we have influential, lazy judging brains) ....... He talks about predictions. For example, if a child gets great grades in the lower grades of school... We often tend to over estimate our ability to predict the future. ...... When it comes to intuition versus formulas ... Often the formula does win. ..... We also are incline to expect regularity much more in our lives and really exist. You won't find any data in this book about ""The Power of Now"" thinking, or discussion about ""You are not your Mind"", Chakras, or myths about healing ... but it's a book about THE WAY WE THINK...

50,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,2," Mr. Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner, explores the general subject of how and why we frequently make irrational decisions. We've all seen articles over the years on various aspects of this phenomenon, but I venture to say that never before have the various aspects and permutations been explored in this depth and specificity. Mr. Kahneman has spent much of his life researching the subject, and since the book includes both his research and that of others, it must stand as the definitive compendium on the subject. His credentials are indisputable, and he tries gamely to bring the subject to life, but -- mea culpa -- I just couldn't stay interested in the myriad of data and specific examples. The book is good for someone really interested in the details, and it does contain real life examples, but after 400 pages it's hard to remember them. My takeaway: Our intuition is frequently wrong, and even our experience (or what we believe our experience to have been) may not be reliable as a decision guide. So, be careful!"

53,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,4,"A long book that requires real mental exertion, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a worthwhile read by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman. It delves into the two complex systems of the mind. System 1 is impulsive, emotional, and often led astray, while System 2 is rational, thoughtful, and takes more time to makes decisions. He analyzes how humans use (and sometimes fail to use) both systems, and the resulting implications on topics ranging from how we perceive happiness to behavioral economics.Thinking, Fast and Slow is one of the most in-depth Psychology books I've read. I fell in love with the subject after taking AP Psychology last year as a junior in high school, and am currently craving more books and articles related to the field. Daniel Kahneman satisfied my thirst. I had a solid understanding of some concepts beforehand, like the confirmation bias and hindsight bias, but had never heard of other terms like base rate or the illusion of validity. The sheer amount of statistics and experiments referenced throughout the book proved Kahneman's thoroughness and dedication.I recommend Thinking, Fast and Slow to anyone who wants to learn about how we think, or about psychology in general. I liked how Kahneman progressed from simple ideas like heuristics to more complex concepts, like prospect theory. Even if you have no background in psychology or economics, a mere interest in either should suffice for this book.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."
54,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/741149-kalin,5,"I haven't felt so stimulated to re-think my thinking ever since I encountered Edward de Bono's books a dozen years ago. A text like this is especially instructive when you consider yourself an ""outside-the-norm"" person; it comes and beats you with a vengeance, time and again, as you try the mental problems inside for yourself--and fail and fail and fail. A lesson in humility, indeed. :)I was particularly happy to find out:- why a single quarrel can ruin a friendship of many years- what is the ratio of positive to negative experiences that makes us perceive a relationship as ""successful""- to what extent we weigh potential losses more than potential gains- how much and why we value our experiences: duration vs intensity- why we at the Human Library lost four fifths of our subscribers when we switched from an opt-out mailing list to an opt-in one... and on and on and on. The book is unusually compact and concrete.Definitely worth our time."
55,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,5,"I feel this book richly deserves its status. Kahneman has handed over the rich & surprising fruits of a lifetime of creative thought and research, in a well-organised book free of academiese (hurrah!) He also makes the material interactive by inviting us to do little mental activities to illustrate his simple study methods and assist the delight of recognition that makes this such an enjoyable read.One of his goals is to provide ways to talk about and tackle some everyday problems by considering the way we think as two interacting systems, and to point out the weaknesses and mistakes that arise from ways these tend to (co)operate. He frankly admits that it is easier to see others' sub-optimal performance than our own, and the tools he offers are generally for 'water-cooler talk' or gossiping about co-workers and negotiation partners. This is a lot better than it sounds, I promise!I would have to type out almost the entire book to share all the insights that impressed me, but I will pick out a few of my favourite themes:People use an 'availability heuristic' to make judgements about how often things occur - if you can think of a lot of examples of something, you tend to assume it is common. This makes us vulnerable to subtle propaganda techniques, and gives rise to an uncritical conflation of what-is-in-the-news with what-is-happening-in-the-world. Kahneman points out that we tend to ignore absent evidence: what-you-see-is-all-there-is (WYSIATI)People do not behave 'rationally' when faced with many types of wager that map onto real life decisions. Most people, in fact, behave in predictably irrational ways. Economic models that treat people as rational agents ('Econs') are deeply flawed. Which is a shame, because economists are using those modelsIntuition is not magic. People who are very experienced and highly trained have the ability to process sense data and make snap decisions before going through the laborious work of stringing verbal thoughts or calculations together. This works well in many situations: for firefighters, sportspeople, medics etc. However, there is a tendency to overinflate the importance of hunches and intuitions in other situations, particularly stock market trading, where Kahneman's statistical analysis shows that people (even experienced workers) are worse than computer programs, and even WORSE THAN RANDOM CHOICE at predicting and picking winners and losers.Perhaps especially in Euro-USian white culture, most of us tend to privilege our 'remembering self' over our 'experiencing self'. We tend to care disproportionately about the end of a story, and the ends of people's lives. People asked whether they would bother going on holiday if they had to have the memory of the holiday erased at the end of it often say they wouldn't. Kahneman's (very gentle!) experiments on pain showed that privileging the remembering self resulted in people choosing to experience MORE pain because of the way the experience was presented. He suggests that giving more thought to the experiencing self could improve life for many people. This echoes the concept of mindfulness that is important in some cultural traditions, therapies and religious practices. A friend pointed out that it was similar to Zen.So, that's your taster; I strongly recommend the whole smorgasbord. I'll definitely be reading this again."

The book is filled with shady experiments on undergraduates and psychology grad students and wild extrapolations of the associated results. I find it exceedingly difficult to take many of the conclusions seriously. I can't read into them. I can't trust them. I can't base my decisions on them and I resist incorporating them into my world view with anything more than 0.01 weight. In fact, several of the experiments that this book mentions were also found to be not reproducible by a recent meta-study on reproducibility in psychology studies.Here's a characteristic example of me reading the book. The author says: ""Consider the word EAT. Now fill in the blank in the following: SO_P. You were much more likely to fill in the blank with a U to make SOUP than with an A to make soap! How amazing. We call this phenomenon priming, system 1, something something"". In fact, no, SOAP came to my mind immediately.All I could think about when I read this book is my own experience of participating in a friend's psychology study once. He designed an experiment and asked me to do some things and answer some questions, but at some point it became extremely clear to me what the experiment was about, or how he hoped I would behave. I went along with it, but I couldn't believe that this would eventually become part of a paper. It was a joke. I'm afraid you can't go through a similar experience and take these studies seriously from then on.All that being said I do find the broad strokes of the system1/system2 division proposed in this book to be interesting and appealing.

The first was Daniel Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" and the second is Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" What caused this? What do they have in common? Both books explain, in minute detail, simple concepts with immensely far-reaching implications, and both have been... after the slog... the most intellectually rewarding reading of my adult life. Where to begin... I have a number of theories running around in my head, and occasionally I try to corral them on paper. I organize, sequence and interconnect them in a way that will prevent my reader from meaningfully widening their eyes, in an aside, while winding their finger around one ear... (""Cuckoo!"") Good writing about complex topics is very, very difficult, and Kahneman has corraled 30+ years of science, his career and all he has learned into a perfectly arranged sequence that leads the reader into a wilderness... provisioning you in each chapter with the tools you'll need for the next part of the journey.The second most striking effect on me is the number of times I said, ""Yes... YES!!! this is what I've been saying!"" In my case it has usually been some sort of ""intuitive""(excuse me, Mr. Kahneman... I mean ""System 1"") recognition of a pattern in my observations about the way we think. In Kahneman's case those intuitions have been converted into theoretical propositions, each meticulously researched in well designed experiments. Clearly, this is at least one difference between me and a Nobel Prize winning researcher.So why does this stuff matter? In the context of broader discussions of free will, intention, choice and control over the directions our lives take, this book can provide powerful insights that might currently be obscured by these ""cognitive illusions"" and the inherent limitations of ""System 1/System 2"" thinking. Perhaps we're not as ""free"" in our decisions as we might like to think, if ""priming"" has such a stunningly reproducible effect. Perhaps we're not so determined, if activities that initially require ""System 2"" attention, can be turned into second-nature, ""technical-expertise intuitions."" I.e. learning and training MATTERS in our ability to detect and respond to events that... if untrained... might take advantage of our brain's inherent ""blind spots"" or weaknesses. Perhaps childhood religious indoctrination is a very adept recognition of these mental tendencies/flaws, so profoundly (if intuitively/naively) expressed by Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order, ""Give me the boy until 7, I will give you the man."" (paraphrased; forgive me) Kahneman's discoveries and documentation of mental capacity and biases could form the basis of a ""Mental Martial Arts"" program: an alternative form of indoctrination, in which students are trained to understand their brains' weaknesses, and learn to take stances or engage in practices that eliminate or reduce the errors to which these weaknesses can lead. This book will rearrange the way you think... about how you think."
61,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671574-john,1,"An unrelentingly tedious book that can be summed up as follows. We are irrationally prone to jump to conclusions based on rule-of-thumb shortcuts to actual reasoning, and in reliance on bad evidence, even though we have the capacity to think our way to better conclusions. But we're lazy, so we don't. We don't understand statistics, and if we did, we'd be more cautious in our judgments, and less prone to think highly of our own skill at judging probabilities and outcomes. Life not only is uncertain, we cannot understand it systemically, and luck has just as much to do with what happens to us -- maybe even more -- than we care to admit. When in doubt, rely on an algorithm, because it's more accurate than your best guess or some expert's opinion. Above all, determine the baseline before you come to any decisions. If you like endless -- and I mean endless -- algebraic word problems and circuitous anecdotes about everything from the author's dead friend Amos to his stint with the Israeli Air Defense Force, if you like slow-paced, rambling explanations that rarely summarize a conclusion, if your idea of a hot date is to talk Bayesian theory with a clinical psychologist or an economist, then this book is for you, who are likely a highly specialized academically-inclined person. Perhaps you are even a blast at parties, I don't know. But if you're like me and you prefer authors to cut to the chase, make their point, and then leave you with a whopping big appendix if you're interested in the regression analysis of how many freshmen would watch a guy choke to death because they think someone else will come to the rescue, then this book is not for you.If you want to take the Reader's Digest pass through the book, then Chapter 1 and Section 3 are probably the most accessible and can be read in less than an hour, and still leave you with a fair understanding of the author's thesis."

I want you to imagine something - say you had spent your entire life and never actually seen an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. That wouldn't mean you wouldn't know anything about Monty Python. It is impossible to have lived at any time since the late 60s and not have had some socially dysfunctional male reprise the entire Parrot sketch or Spanish Inquisition sketch at you at some stage in your life. I suspect, although there is no way to prove this now, obviously, that Osama bin Laden could do the Silly Walk like a natural. Well, if you had never seen an episode of Monty Python and your entire experience of their work was via the interpretation of men of a certain age down the pub - then finally getting to see an episode of the original would be much the same effect as reading this book. Hundreds of people have already told all this guy's best stories in their own books - but all the same it is a pleasure to hear them again by the guy that first said, 'this parrot is dead' or rather, 'framing effects make fools of us all'.You need to read this book - but what is particularly good about it is that you come away from it knowing we really are remarkably easy to fool. It's because we think we know stuff that this comes as a constant surprise to us. Years ago I was talking to a guy who liked to bet. Everyone needs a hobby and that was his. Anyway, he told me he was playing two-up - an Australian betting game - and he realised something like tails hadn't come up frequently enough and so he started betting on tails and sure enough he made money. I told him that coins don't remember the last throw and so the odds of getting a tail was still 50%, as it had previously been. But I had no credibility - I'd already told him I never bet - so, how would I possibly know anything if I wasn't even brave enough to put my own money on the outcome? And didn't I understand the point of this story was he had already WON?Still, when faced with a series of coin flips that run - H, H, H, H, H, T, H, H, H - it does feel like tails are 'due'. This is the sort of mistake we are all too prone to make. The thing to remember is that while there is a law of large numbers - toss a coin often enough and in the very long run there will be as many heads turn up as tails - that isn't the case in the short run - where just about anything is possible.We (that is, we humans) are remarkably bad at mental statistics. And what makes it worse is that we are predictably bad at statistics. And this brings me to Bourdieu and him saying that Sociology is kind of martial art. He means that Sociology allows you to defend yourself from those who would manipulate you. Well, this book is the Bruce Lee book of advanced self-defence. Learning just how we fool ourselves might not make you feel terribly great about what it means to be human - but at least you will know why you hav stuffed up next time you do stuff up. I'm not sure it will stop you stuffing up - but that would be asking for an awful lot from one book.If you want the short version of this book, he has provided the two papers that probably got him the Nobel Prize - and they are remarkably clear, easy to understand and comprehensive. But look, read this book - it will do you good. "

Not that the second part is bad, mind you; the entire book is well-written and obviously the product of someone who knows their field. There’s just a lot of it. Thinking, Fast and Slow is kind of like a guest who shows up to your party and then dazzles everyone with an impromptu, 15-minute oration on the geopolitical situation in South Ossetia; and, everyone applauds and turns to go back to their own conversations, only for the guest to launch into another story about the time they parachuted into the Balkans to break up a nascent civil war, a story which is followed quickly by a similar tale of a visit to Southeast Asia…. Well, I think you catch my drift. Daniel Kahneman spins an interesting tale of human psychology and the way our brains interpret and act on data. But the book overstays its welcome by a few hundred pages.Kahneman’s thesis breaks our decision-making systems into two pieces, System 1 and System 2, which are the respective “fast” and “slow” of the title. System 1 provides intuitive judgements based on stimulus we might not even be conscious of receiving; it’s the snap signals that we might not even know we are acting upon. System 2 is the more contemplative, cognitively taxing counterpart that we engage for serious mental exertion. Though often oppositional in the types of decisions they produce, Kahneman is keen to emphasize that it’s not about System 1 versus System 2. Instead, he’s out to educate us about how the interplay between these systems causes us to make decisions that aren’t always rational or sensible given the statistics and evidence at hand.Kahneman takes us through an exhaustive tour of biases and fallacies people are prone to making. He talks about the halo effect, affection bias, confirmation bias, and even regression to the mean. As a mathematician, I liked his angle on probability and statistics; as a logician, I appreciated his brief segues into the logical aspects of our contradictory decision-making processes. Lest I give the impression Kahneman gets too technical, however, I should emphasize that, despite its length, Thinking, Fast and Slow remains aggressively accessible. There are a few points where, if you don’t have a basic grasp of probability (and if Kahneman demonstrates anything, it’s that most people don’t), then you might feel talked over (or maybe it’s those less-than-infrequent, casual mentions of “and later I won a Nobel Prize”). But this book isn’t so much about science as it is about people.There are two other things I really appreciated about this book, both of which are related to psychology. I’m a fairly easygoing person, and I don’t always like to make waves, but sometimes I like to make some trouble and argue with some of my friends about whether psychology is a science. The problem for psychology is that it’s actually a rather broad term for a series of overlapping fields of investigation into human behaviour. On one end of this continuum, you have Freud and Jung and the various psychoanalysts who, let’s face it, are one step up from astrologers and palm-readers. On the other end, you have the cutting-edge cognitive psychology informed by the neuroscience of MRIs, split-brain studies, and rat research. So claiming that psychology is or isn’t a science is a little simplistic, and I’m willing to grant that there are areas within psychology that are science. For what it’s worth, Kahneman went a long way to reinforcing this: it’s clear he and his collaborators have done decades of extensive research. (Now, yes, it’s social science, but I won’t get into that particular snobbery today.)The other thing I liked about Thinking, Fast and Slow is its failure to mention evolutionary psychology. Once in a while, Kahneman alludes to System 1’s behaviour being the result of evolutionary adaptation—and that’s fine, because it is true, almost tautologically so. But he never quite delves into speculation about why such behaviour evolved, and I appreciate this. There’s a difference between identifying something as an adaptation and determining why it’s an adaptation, and I’m not a fan of evolutionary psychologists’ attempts to reduce everything to the trauma of trading trees for bipedalism … I’m willing to admit I have an ape brain, but culture must count for something, hmm?I suppose it’s also worth mentioning that this book reaffirms my supercilious disregard for economics. According to Kahneman, stock brokers and investors have no idea what they are doing—and some of them know this, but most of them don’t. Economists are, for the most part, highly-trained, but they seem bent upon sustaining this theoretical fantasy land in which humans are rational creatures. Aristotle aside, the data seem to say it isn’t so. I occasionally try my hand at reading books about the economy, just so I can say I did, but they usually end up going over my head. I’m a mathematician and I don’t get numbers—but at least I’m not the only one.So Thinking, Fast and Slow is genuinely interesting. I learned a lot from it. I would rate it higher, but I was starting to flag as I approached the finish line. Truth be told, I skipped the two articles Kahneman includes at the end that were the original publications about the theories he explains in the book. I’m sure they are fascinating for someone with more stamina, but at that point I just wanted to be done. That’s never good: one of the responsibilities of a non-fiction author is to know how to pace a book and keep its length appropriate. Too short and the book is unsatisfying—too long, and maybe it’s more so. And I think this flaw is entirely avoidable; it’s a result of Kahneman’s tendency to reiterate, to circle back around to the same discussions over and over again. He spends an entire chapter on prospect theory, then a few chapters later he’s telling us about its genesis all over again, just from a slightly different angle. Like that party guest, Kahneman is full of interesting stories, but after telling one after another for such a long period of time, it starts sounding like white noise. And he ate all those little cocktail snacks too.I inevitably ended up comparing Thinking, Fast and Slow to 
How We Decide
, a much slimmer volume along much the same lines as this one. Whereas Lehrer’s focus is on the neurology behind decision-making, Kahneman is more interested in the psychology. Both books boil down to: we suck at automatic decision-making when statistics are involved; therefore, we behave less rationally than we believe we do. Lehrer explains why things go wrong, and Kahneman categorizes all the different way things go wrong. In many ways the books are complementary, and if this is an area of interest for you, I’ll recommend them both. For the casual reader, however, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rather dense meal. By all means, give it a try, but take it slow.Also posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my reviews and subscribe to my digest newsletter.

64,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14972518-vijai,4,"If your objective, like it is when one finishes reading a self-help book, is to implement what Mr. Kahneman has to say in real life and benefit from it, I should warn you, you will be sorely disappointed. Believe it or not, in my opinion, I believe Mr. Kahneman is telling you exactly that in this book - that whether you like it or not, your entire life is guided or may I say decided by two fundamental ideas and that there is very little you can do to change it, period. Mr. Kahneman is probably the villain in every modern day spiritual guru's life, he argues very effectively that contrary to what these gurus may say the external world/ your environment/ surroundings/ or even society for that matter has a large say in your personal deliberate actions. You don't have a choice. So, having said that, shelving this book in psychology section would be gross injustice. In my view this is such a good commentary of human nature. The two are different, very much so. Read it, totally worth it in my opinion. Can get a little too drab but hang in there, this book is an eye opener."
65,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369435-jay-kamaladasa,5,"Hands down, one of the best books in its genre. The book is a lengthy, self-conscious and a challenging read but highly recommended if you're interested in why human beings behave the way they behave. It's given me so much 'oh snap, so that's why we're so dumb' moments that at this point I don't even want to admit I'm a human to any space-time traveling race that comes in collision of 21st century Earth.Citing behavioral research studies, he's convinced me that human confidence is a measure of whether a person has built up a coherent story not that the person truly knows what she's doing. He's convinced me that the feeling of 'ease' is just cognitive familiarity. He's convinced me why first impressions matter more than we think due to the Halo effect. He's convinced me that the human mind doesn't understand non-events. We think we understand the past, but we really don't. We create coherency by attributing causality to events, but not to non-events. In other words we underestimate the role of luck or the role of unknown variables in a given situation. He has given me reason to believe that in low validity environments, it's better to use formula's than to listen to expert human judgment. For example, the stability of a marriage can be better predicted by a simple equation like [stability = frequency of love making - frequency of arguing] than an expert opinion.But one of the most interesting hypothesis he builds up is the existence of two systems in the mind. System 1 is prone to cognitive biases described above, but it's also where morality comes from. Not to mention intuitive judgment and hueristic answers to life's everyday questions. Would you believe it? Morality is more of an intuitive thing than a logical and reasonable framework! And the funny thing is without system 1, we'd won't survive a day in the life. Not to mention we wouldn't act human. System 2 on the other hand is more introspective, rational and is capable of being aware of the cognitive biases created by System 1. If my understanding is correct then, we can replicate system 2 by a machine or artificial intelligence. But that machine will not have the same extent of morality that we have.... food for thought! In later chapters of the book, he describes another variation of duality in the human mind. An Experiencing Self and a Remembering Self. With countless examples (both experimental and anecdotal) he vividly paints a picture of how humans have this notion of ""I am my remembering self, and strangely my experiencing self is a stranger to me."" We're actually okay with letting our Experiencing Self suffer for the good of the Remembering Self!! This ties in to the cognitive bias of ""focusing Illusion"" (Focalism) and how we tend to overestimate a certain aspect of life. To put the icing on the cake he finalizes the book by analyzing how we appreciate, value and judge the quality of our lives with all these biases combined. And it's amazing how irrational we are in doing so. Not only have I realized from this book that I should stop worrying about societal standards (because they are mostly based on irrational biases) but that I should spend a significant amount of my time and effort to into creating a value structure ideally suited for myself. Now, only if I had bit more memory and cpu speed on System 2..."
66,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,3,"Thinking, Fast and Slow is just okay. It's being marketed as a book on psychology (and economic psychology, in particular) for the layperson. I'm not sure if other laypeople agree, but this wasn't really for me. And it's not that the prose is too technical (okay, sometimes it is) but rather that Kahneman is stuck somewhere between academic technicalities and clear expressive prose.

67,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"It is very difficult to judge, review or analyze a book that basically challenges the very idea of human “Rationalism”. Are humans perfectly rational? This dude, Daniel Kahneman, got a Nobel Prize in Economics for saying they are not. An ordinary person might have been treated with glare or a stinging slap if he said that to someone’s face. We simply don’t like being told that we are not very rational and certainly not as intelligent as we think we are. Hidden in the depths of our consciousness, are some ‘actors’ that keep tempering with our ‘rationality’. And we almost consciously allow this to happen. 	All in all, this book is a tour de force of Behavioral Psychology. Explaining how our mind comes to conclusions and makes decisions, Kahneman explains that our intuition and decision making part of brain has two personalities. These personalities, he says, are not two different or distinct systems but to understand them better, we will have to assign personalities not only to understand them better but also to be able to relate to them on a personal level. 	The two systems are called system 1 and system 2, for the sake of convenience. System 1 is vigilant, impulsive, judgmental, easily manipulated, highly emotional. System 2, on the other hand is the total opposite of system 1, it is very intelligent, indolent, mostly drowsing off in the back of our head, difficult to convince and extremely stubborn, and it only comes to action when there is some sort of ‘emergency’. Both these systems are susceptible to a number of biases, system 1 more than system 2.	I thought Kahneman would build up this narrative systematically but he goes on to give us a tour of his years of research, experiments and surveys exploring every nook of our conscious human mind. He focuses on a diverse set of heuristics and biases that influence our judgments in everyday life. With some brilliant experiments and survey reports, he convincingly elaborates the effects that these biases have on our decisions. Never forgetting to highlight the fallacies of our consciousness, he touches on a number of other important breakthroughs in the world of psychology. This is a very simple case of visual illusion where we see two lines of same size appearing to be of varying lengths. Even after knowing that they are equal and the illusion is created by the fins attached to them, our system 1 still impulsively signals that one of them is longer then the other. Through this simple illustration, he moves on to introduce Cognitive Illusions, which are more fascinating, and are drastically more effective.	Kahneman contends that it is extremely difficult to overcome heuristic biases. Although, through methods like using statistical formulas and deliberate scrutiny we can ‘rationalize’ our decisions to some extent. Still, we are inherently prone to fall for dazzling rhetoric and dashing figures, we believe in myths and incidents that are as improbable as they are ludicrous, because this is the way we see things. But this is not undesirable altogether, some of the intuitive abilities are an evolutionary blessing that help us understand emotions and make correct decision in split seconds. Neither does the author deems it expedient to overcome these biases, but only to recognize them and put our system 2 to work before making crucial judgments. 	 I am afraid that this review is getting a bit too long, and to be honest, I don’t think anyone reads long reviews.(Except some of my nerdy goodread friends who then leave an equally baffling Proustian comment, which of course, takes quite a while to be properly understood.) So I will mention a summary of some critical biases, ideas and psychological phenomenon that I found interesting. 	---------------------------------------------------------------I have attempted to summarize some heuristics, biases and psychological principle that I thought would make a fascinating introduction to tempt a novice like me to further explore the subject. They are just the tip of iceberg and not by any means exhaustive and just comprise a small part of what this book is all about. Associative machine: System 1 works in surprising ways, read this 			BANANA VOMIT Now, a lot happened in last few seconds when you read these two words. You wore an expression of disgust and a very bad image came to your mind, your body too reacted in disgust and for short time you might not want to eat bananas. All of this was automatic and beyond your control. It was “The Associative Machine” of system 1. We associate seemingly some unrelated images and with some imagination, form an image. Our brain loves patterns and some times it sees things that aren’t even there. A very interesting clip in which Simon Singh shows associative machine at work : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bG7E...Priming: Exposure to a word causes immediate changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen if you had just seen WASH.Similarly, exposure to an idea or event can also have similar temporary effect on our behavior. (“Florida Effect”)Cognitive Ease: We all love it when we don’t have to work too hard because system 2 doesn’t like being bothered. So we admire and rather look for cognitive ease. Things that are less complex have a positive effect on our behavior. Psychologists use the term “Mind at ease puts a smile on the face”. Similarly, smiling and laughing can also ease our mind (system 1) and make us feel confident and in control. Anything that is easy to understand (read or see) is likely to have a more positive effect on us as compared to anything that we have a hard time understanding or visualizing.Exposure Effect: We are more likely to choose the thing we are more familiar with. The principle that “Familiarity breeds liking” suggests that we are more inclined towards anything that is familiar and has been exposed to us before in past. The more the exposure is, the more we will be inclined towards it. This principle is excellently illustrated in Will Smith’s “Focus” (2015).a similar trick is used to con a billionaire. Normality illusion: Things that recur with greater frequency are considered normal, no matter how horrendous they are. Two people killed in a terrorist attack in a western country are more likely to be mourned then a hundreds of children killed in Gaza by a missile strike. Simply due to the fact that children in Gaze get bombed all the time, while a terrorist attack that kills innocents is sort of rarity in Europe and America. (The same concept is present in Orwell’s Animal Farm in which pigs start to dominate other animals and it becomes the norm after a while.)Substitution: If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it. For instance when asked How happy are you with your life these days? Its more likely that we don’t use a broad frame to answer the question and substitute it with a simpler question “What is my mood right now?”. System 1 can readily answer the substitute question but to answer the real question, System 2 would have to be excited, which as we know System 2 doesn’t like. In everyday life, we use this to avoid making decisions and expressions based on factual background and therefore make an impulsive and sometimes irrational comment to a difficult question.  What you see is there is: We take pride in our intuitive abilities which leads us to believe that we know the whole truth, no matter how fallible our sources are, and not withstanding the fact that there is always another side of the picture. When we hear a story or an incident, we tend to accept it as a fact without considering any view dissenting or contradicting it. Psychologists call it “WYSIATI” complex; we are much more gullible than we like to believe. But it is again the mischief of System 1 that leads us to believe a narrative impulsively and without further inquisition as to its authenticity. It is also another example of our intuitive tendency to see things in a narrow frame.Loss Aversion: Call it a gift of evolution or survival instinct, but we are naturally loss averse in most of our decisions. We are more likely to abandon a huge profit if there is some probability of an equally huge loss. We do want to have more, but not at the cost of putting our own at stake, we relish our possessions more than our desire to have more. Overconfidence and Hindsight bias: A general limitation of our mind is its imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge, or beliefs that have changed. Once you adopt a new view of the world (or any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed. We see people everyday saying that what just happened was what they always thought would happen and they, in their overconfidence, start believing that they always knew in hindsight that such an event was probable. (see Halo Effect) Prospect theory: This theory attempts to explain the way people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. Kahneman illustrates it through this graph This theory is one of his most important in the field of behavioral economics. Owing to its complexity, I can not summarize it here. P.S I highly recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in Behavioral Psychology. Don’t waste your time on self-help books when you can read the real stuff."
68,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,4,"Often I find myself in conversations with people who are criminally opinionated, but have little in the way of empirical grounding. It’s common in these situations to hear them malign opponents of their views by reducing the conflict to a single factor; My opponent is so dumb they couldn’t hump a bacteria if they were a horny phage. Now, putting aside the fact that single factor analysis is a mugs game when discussing things of any complexity (which is basically everything), when resorting to these oversimplifications with human behavior, you asymptotically approach infinite incorrectness. My common refrain in these times is to dip into my quote bag and castigate the misguided with Popper’s glib witticism: “A theory that explains everything, explains nothing.” Or, channeling the Arch Bishop of astuteness, John Stuart Mill, I rise up, gesturing dramatically and pitching my voice just so: “He who knows only his side of the case knows little of that.” Hoping their snotty self assurance will recede before my rational indignation like an anabolic hairline.This shit never works. Putting aside the fact that I’m subject to the same cognitive limitations, quotations often arrive on the scene like a flaccid member, with intimations of a proper impression hidden somewhere in that bloodless noodle, if only the other party would play with it. But, much like idioms, there’s just not enough chemistry to warrant heavy petting.Next I will resort to recalling numerous studies which have totally pin-cushioned the quaint notion that we are dispassionate, logical thinkers. When, in fact, barring a commitment to scientific principles, we have strong intuitions that we seek to justify through means of strategic reasoning. “We’re more like lawyers than Vulcans.” I say solemnly. Starring off into the distance for dramatic effect. Pensive. Avoiding eye contact for an appropriate interval before turning to peer into their soul and nod as we grasp, however tenuously, our feeble position before the Logos. Inevitably, when this numinous moment arrives, I am instead greeted with a vacant stare, or, much worse, an objection! Which, if you’ve been following me so far, means that I switch from attempting to persuade and instead silently chide my opponent for being a hopeless imbecile.How do we opt out of being unrelenting self righteous pricks? Well, we probably can’t fully, the gravity is just too strong. Escape velocity would require some fundamental redesigns to a cognitive apparatus which evolved to intuit a subset of phenomena on the African savanna which bore a relationship to our reproductive success. But we can sure as hell beat one another with books like this until we piss blood and can’t hold our toothbrushes due to nasty rotator cuff injuries. That’ll teach us. I consider this to be the Mac Daddy of bibliophilic bludgeoning implements on this topic. I once blasted a man in the chest so hard with the spine of this book that, in addition to the bastard rolling clean over a Pizza Hut table like it was the hood of a speeding vehicle, the pages burst from between the covers like a fox vomiting hen feathers. So incensed by this needless destruction of literary property, I stood over the man and berated him on the importance of properly breaking in the spines of hardcovers. As he wormed about in pepperoni and soda, nodding (if for no other reason than to avoid another terrible sounding of his sternum) I also took the time to explain the central message of this book:“Look, man. You need to realize that we’ve got these two modes of cognition. One is accessible to us. It’s slow and deliberative and subject to systematic interventions of logic if we but choose to learn and apply them. The other does pretty much whatever it damn well pleases based on input it receives from the environment that you’re often not consciously aware of. It’s good when it’s helping you get out of the way of deranged book wielders, but it’s bad when it goes awry in matters that are deeply counter intuitive (much of modern life) and mucks about with your ability to properly steer the system you have access to.”This is an important book. Humanity would be much improved if these insights could percolate through society and really take hold. But they probably won’t. Because we’re assholes."

I'm leaving it out in the living room for now, though--for refreshers.The author's aim is to prove to us that we are not rational beings to the extent we think we are, that evolution has seen to that. And that being the case, the book outlines what we need to know so as not to mess up decisions like we have been doing--like we all do. And he's made it accessible. He pulls you in. You will get your share of ""Aha!"" moments. You can read it at whatever level you want. You can skim over the more complicated parts and go for the pithy conclusions. Or if you are really into the science and scholarship, there are footnotes in the back--stealth footnotes without the little numbers on the book's pages, so as not to intimidate the general audience. All based on science. It's true whether you like it or not. And it is applicable to your life. You can't go over it, you can't go under it, so go through it--with this book.

70,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"This book had me laughing and smiling, more than many a book described in its blurb as side-splittingly funny or something similar because I recognised the cognitive disillusions described in this book as my own and in any case I am the kind of person who if they fall into a good mood wonders if it's due to the pint and the pie that was eaten earlier.In my case the preacher wasn't talking to the choir, but I had been to the church before and enjoyed the services. It doesn't set out to be a new book full of new discoveries. It's a comfortable round up of research, investigations and thought, polished off with a couple of Kahneman's early articles as appendices. If you've read The Halo Effect ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers(which puts some of these cogitative delusions in a business context, it has an excellent anecdote about the failure of a Lego product), or something along those lines you'll be familiar with some of the ideas here.By now I'm quite comfortable accepting that I am not rational and that other people aren't either and that statistical thinking is alien to probably to almost everybody and Kahneman's book happily confirms my opinion. And few things make us as happy as having our own biases confirmed to us.There are however a couple of problems. Firstly there are some people who apparently are wedded to the notion that people are entirely rational. They either will not read this book, read and reject it or indeed read it, accept it's findings but mentally note them as curious aberrations that don't affect their belief - this is discussed in the book.More seriously society is organised on the tacit assumption that we are not only capable of being rational but will put the effort into doing so when required. Unfortunately studies demonstrating the effect of meals on Judges reviewing parole cases (like the state pawn broker in Down and out in Paris and London they are more lenient after lunch and harsher beforehand and once they get hungry again) or voter behaviour which turns out to be influenced by where the polling booth is located. This makes me wonder. My polling station used to be in the Adult Education Centre, now that's been closed down, if the polling centre was moved to the police station would my voting habits transform into those of a Fishin', Huntin' and Floggin' Tory who froths at the mouth hearing the words 'illegal immigrants'? Maybe I need a snack. Much in the book is useful, 90% fat free does sound better than 10% fat, there's a lot to be learnt here in how to describe or state a problem to push people towards certain responses by framing or anchoring the information you give. Of course this happens to us all the time as it is. One of my favourite of Kahneman's examples comes from when he was working with Israeli flight instructors. They were convinced that shouting and swearing at trainee pilots was the best method of improving their performance - experience proved it - when a pilot under performed they swore at him and on the next attempt the trainee would do better. Plainly shouting works. Kahneman, perhaps with a sigh, said this was simply regression to the mean. After poor performance what ever they did would be followed by improved performance, swearing and shouting have no magic power. To demonstrate he had the instructors throw balls of paper over their shoulder's into a waste paper bin and tracked the results on a handy black board showing that performance varied up and down irrespective of swearing. Still I wonder if returning to work the instructors developed an enlightened instruction method or if they rapidly regressed to the mean and shouted and swore again.I used to think that politicians answered a different question to the one given by the interviewer in an attempt to be evasive. Post Kahneman I wonder if this is just the natural tendency of the brain to substitute an easier question for a harder one. Who knows. "
71,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an excellent book about how we think, written by a Nobel-prize-winning economist. Kahneman explains how two ""systems"" in the mind make decisions. ""System 1"" is the fast, intuitive aspect of the mind. ""System 2"" is the slower, logical and reasoning part of the mind. We generally make decisions quickly with the System 1, often because System 2 is simply--lazy. It takes effort to think things out rationally, and our rational minds are not always up to the job. This book is a long, comprehensive explanation of why we make decisions the way we do. Both systems are necessary, but both are subject to fallacies. Kahneman explains many of these fallacies. Most people do not really understand probability, so we are not good at judging relative levels of risk. Our decisions are strongly colored by how we frame questions in our minds. Simply re-framing a question can easily cause people--even professionals like doctors--to reverse decisions. We need to understand these framing issues, to avoid bad decisions. Elements of causality and Bayesian probability are described in some detail.One of the most interesting aspects of the ways we think, is the concept of availability. Often, when subjected to a difficult question, we answer immediately. But really, we do not answer the question at hand--we have made a subtle switch to a simpler question, without even realizing it. Kahneman describes this quick switch to an available answer, in quite a bit of detail. Another interesting aspect is what he calls ""hedonic"" theory. Our memories of pleasant and unpleasant experiences are very much colored by their peak intensities and their ends--but definitely not by their durations. In other words, a short, very unpleasant experience is remembered as being much worse than an very long duration, unpleasant experience.Some of the explanations of our ways of thinking may seem basic and obvious if you have read other psychology books. But then you realize--Kahneman and his colleague Amos Tversky discovered these aspects of psychology, by conducting a wide variety of clever experiments. Very well written, and understandable to the non-specialist, I highly recommend this book to anybody interested in psychology."

74,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"Freeman “Dyson Sphere” Dyson wrote the New York Times review, which has me swooning right there. Dyson was a particularly apt pick because Kahneman helped design the Israeli military screening and training systems back when the country was young, and Dyson at 20 years old cranked statistics for the British Bombing Command in its youth. Dyson was part of a small group that figured out the bombers were wrong about what mattered to surviving night time raids over Germany; a thing only about a quarter of the crews did over a tour. Dyson figured out the Royal Airforce's theories about who lived and died were wrong. But no data driven changes were made because “the illusion of validity does not disappear just because facts prove it to be false. Everyone at Bomber Command, from the commander in chief to the flying crews, continued to believe in the illusion. The crews continued to die, experienced and inexperienced alike, until Germany was overrun and the war finally ended.” http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi... Why did the British military resist the changes? Because it was deeply inconsistent the heroic story of the RAF they believed in. Suppose there are stories I’d die for too. But not the myth that Kahneman dethroned. Kahneman got the Nobel Prize for Economics for showing that the Rational Man of Economics model of human decision making was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human decision making. We are not evolved to be rational wealth maximizers, and we systematically value and fear some things that should not be valued so highly or feared so much if we really were the Homo Economicus the Austrian School seems to think we should be. Which is personally deeply satisfying, because I never bought it and deeply unsettling because of how many decisions are made based on that vision. If that was all this book was, it’d just be another in a mass of books that have as their thesis “You’re wrong about that!” Which I appreciate knowing, but there’s a point where it’s a little eye rolling because they don’t offer any helpful suggestions on how not to be wrong, or why these patterns of wrongness exist and endure. But Kahneman has a theory. He theorizes that humans have two largely separate decision-making systems: System One (the fast) and System Two (the slow). System One let us survive monster attacks and have meaningful relationships with each other. System Two let us get to the moon. Both systems have values built into them and any system of decision-making that edits them out is doomed to undercut itself. Some specifics that struck me:Ideomotor Effect: (53) Concepts live in our heads in associative networks. Once triggered, they cascade concepts. Make someone walk slow, they think about old age. Make someone smile, and they’ll be happier. Seeing a picture of cash makes us more independent, more selfish, and less likely to pick up something someone else has dropped. Seeing a locker makes us more likely to vote for school bonds. Reminding people of their mortality makes them more receptive of authoritarian ideas.” (56) “Studies of priming effects have yielded discoveries that threaten our self-image as conscious and autonomous authors of our judgments and our choices.” (55). Halo Effect (82) “If you like the president’s politics, you probably like his voice and appearance as well.” We find someone attractive and we conclude they’re competent. We find emotional coherence pleasing and lack of coherence frustrating. However, far fewer things are correlated than we believe. What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI) (85). Our system one is pattern seeking. Our system 2 is lazy; happy to endorse system 1 beliefs without doing the hard math. “Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is so important to an understanding of intuitive thinking, and comes up so often in this book, that I will use a cumbersome abbreviation for it: WYSIATI. . . System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and quantity of information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions.” (86). Absolutely essentially for not getting eaten by lurking monsters, and “explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world. Much of the time, the coherent story we put together is close enough to reality to support reasonable action.” Except when it doesn’t. Like in our comparative risk assessments. We panic about shark attacks and fail to fear riptides; freak out about novel and unusual risks and opportunities and undervalue the pervasive ones. Answering an Easier Question (97). If one question is hard, we’ll substitute an easier one. It can be a good way to make decisions. Unless the easier question is not a good substitute. I have an uneasy awareness that I do this. Especially since it often REALLY ANNOYS me when people do it to me. The Law of Small Numbers. (109) The counties with the lowest level of kidney cancer are rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. Why? Good clean living? The counties with the highest level of kidney cancer are rural, sparsely populated, and located in traditionally Republican states. Why? Lack of access to health care? Wait, what? The System 1 mind immediately comes up with a story to explain the difference. But once the numbers are cranked, apparently, it’s just an artifact of the fact that a few cases in a small county skews the rate. But if you base your decision on either story, the outcomes will be bad. Anchors (119). We seize on the first value offered, no matter how obviously absurd it is. If you want to push someone in a direction, get them to accept your anchor. Regression to the Mean. (175) There will be random fluctuations in the quality of performance. A teacher who praises a randomly good performance may shape behavior, but likely will simply be disappointed as statistics asserts itself and a bad performance follows. A teacher who criticizes a bad performance may incentivize, but likely will simply have a false sense of causation when statistics asserts itself and a good performance happens. Kahneman describes it as “a significant fact of the human condition: the feedback to which life exposes us too is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.” (176). The Illusion of Understanding (204) The sense-making machinery of System 1 makes us see the world as more tidy, simple, predictable, and coherent than it really is. The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the further illusion that one can control the future. These illusions are comforting. They reduce the anxiety that we would experience if we allowed ourselves to fully acknowledge the uncertainties of existence. We all have a need for the reassuring message that actions have appropriate consequences, and that success will reward wisdom and courage.” But it doesn’t . (212). For example, we’re totally wrong about whether you can beat the stock market. Formulas are often much more predictive than learned intuition. I’m going to have to wrestle with this one, but he alluded to a claim by Robyn Dawes that “marital stability is well predicted by a formula: frequency of lovemaking minus frequency of quarrels.” (226) Snicker. Premortems Can Help. (264) before making a decision, assign someone to imagine it’s a year into the future and the plan was a disaster. Have them write a history of the disaster. We value losses more than gains. (349) Which is fine except when that means we expose others to more risk because we did the math wrong. The Focusing Illusion (402) “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.” We overvalue what’s in our mind at the moment, which is subject to priming. He closes by stressing he does not mean to say that people are irrational. But, he says, “rational” in economic terms has a particular meaning that does not describe people. “For economists and decision theorists, [rationality] has an altogether different meaning. The only test of rationality is not whether a person’s beliefs and preferences are reasonable, but whether they are internally consistent. A rational person can believe in ghosts, so long as all her other beliefs are consistent with the existence of ghosts. . . . Rationality is logical coherence – reasonable or not. Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming evidence that Humans cannot be. . . . 	“The definition of rationality as coherence is impossibly restrictive; it demands adherence to rules of logic that a finite mind is not able to implement. Reasonable people cannot be rational by that definition, but they should not be branded as irrational for that reason. Irrational is a strong word, which connotes impulsivity, emotionality, and a stubborn resistance to reasoned argument. I often cringe when my work with Amos [Tversky] is credited with demonstrating that human choices are irrational, when in fact our research only showed that Humans are not well described by the rational-agent model.” (411) 	A good read."

Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.
I think this book is mistitled. For years, I assumed that it was some kind of self-help book about when to trust your gut and when to trust your head, and thus I put off reading it. But Thinking, Fast and Slow is nothing of the sort. As I finally discovered when the book was gifted to me (the ecstatic blurbs in the front pages were the first clue), this book is the summary of Daniel Kahneman’s study of cognitive errors. The book should probably be called: Thinking, Just Not Very Well.Granted, my initial impression had a grain of truth. Kahneman’s main focus is on what we sometimes call our gut. This is the “fast thinking” of the title, otherwise known as our intuition. Unlike many books on the market, which describe the wonders of human intuition and judgment, Kahneman’s primary focus was on how our intuition can systematically fail to draw correct conclusions. So you might say that this is a book about all of the reasons you should distrust your gut.Every researcher of the mind seems to divide it up into different hypothetical entities. For Freud it was the conscious and unconscious, while for Kahneman there are simply System 1 and System 2. The former is responsible for fast thinking—intuition, gut feelings—and the second is responsible for slow thinking—deliberative thought, using your head. System 2, while admirably thorough and logical, is also effortful and sluggish. Trying any unfamiliar mental task (such as mental arithmetic) can convince you of this. Thus, we must rely on our fast-acting System 1 for most of any given day.System 1 generates answers to questions without any experience of conscious deliberation. Most often these answers are reasonable, such as when answering the question “What you like a hamburger?” (Answer: yes). But, as Kahneman demonstrates, there are many situations in which the answer that springs suddenly to mind is demonstrably false. This would not be a problem if our conscious System 2 detected these falsehoods. Yet our default position is to simply go with our intuition unless we have a strong reason to believe our intuition is misleading. Unfortunately, the brain has no warning system to tell you that your gut feeling is apt to be unreliable. You can call these sorts of situations “cognitive illusions.”A common theme in these cognitive illusions is a failure of our intuition to deal with statistical information. We are good at thinking in terms of causes and comparisons, but situations involving chance throw us off. As an example, imagine a man who is shy, quiet, and orderly. Is he more likely to be a librarian or a farmer? Now consider the answer that springs to mind (librarian, I assume): how was it generated? Your mind compared the description to the stereotype of a librarian, and made the judgment. But this judgment did not take into account the fact that there are many times more farmers than male librarians.Another example of this failure of intuition is the mind’s tendency to generate causal stories to explain random statistical noise. A famous example of this is the “hot hand” in basketball: interpreting a streak of successful shots as due to the player being especially focused, rather than simply as a result a luck. (Although subsequent research has shown that there was something to the idea, after all. So maybe we should not lament too much about our intuitions!) Another well-known example is the tendency for traders to attribute their success or failure in the stock market to skill, while Kahneman demonstrated that the rankings of a group of traders from year to year had no correlation at all. The basic point is that we are generally hesitant to attribute something to chance, and instead invent causal stories that “explain” the variation.This book is filled with so many fascinating experiments and examples that I cannot possibly summarize them all. Suffice to say that the results are convincing, not only because of the weight of evidence, but mainly because Kahneman is usually able to demonstrate the principle at work on the reader. Our intuitive reactions are remarkably similar, apparently, and I found that I normally reacted to his questions in the way that he predicted. If you are apt to believe that you are a rational person (as I am) it can be quite depressing.After establishing the groundwork, Kahneman sets his sights on the neighboring discipline of economics. Conventional economic theory presupposes rational actors who are able to weigh risks and to act in accordance with their desires. But, as Kahneman found, this does hold with actual people. Not only do real humans act irrationally, but real humans deviate from the expected predictions of the rational agent model systematically. This means that we humans are (to borrow a phrase from another book in this vein) predictably irrational. Our folly is consistent.One major finding is that people are loss-averse. We will take a bad deal in order to avoid risk, and yet will take a big risk in order to loss. This behavior seems to be motivated by an intense fear of regret, and it is the cause of a certain amount of conservatism, not only in economics, but in life. If an action turns out badly, we tend to regret it more of it was an exceptional rather than a routine act (picking up a hitchhiker rather than driving to work, for example), and so people shy away from abnormal options that carry uncertainty.Yet, logically speaking, there is no reason to regret a special action more than a customary one, just as there is no reason to weigh losses so much more heavily than gains. Of course, there is good evolutionary logic for these tendencies. In a dangerous environment, losing a gamble could mean losing your life, so it is best to stay to the tried-and-true. But in an economic context, this strategy is not usually optimal.The last section of the book was the most interesting of all, at least from a philosophical perspective. Kahneman investigates how our memories systematically misrepresent our experiences, which can cause a huge divergence between experienced happiness and remembered joy. Basically, when it comes to memory, intensity matters more than duration, and the peaks and ends of experiences matter more than their averages. The same applies with pain: We may remember one experience as less painful than another just because the pain was mild when it ended. And yet, in terms of measured pain per minute, the first experience may actually have included more experiential suffering.As a result of this, our evaluations of life satisfaction can often have very little to do with our real, experiential well being. This presents us with something of a paradox, since we often do things, not for how much joy they will bring us in the moment, but for the nice memory they will create. Think about this: How much money would you spend on a vacation if you knew that every trace of the experience would be wiped out as soon as the vacation ended, including photos and even your memories? The answer for most people is not much, if anything at all. This is why so many people (myself included) frantically take photos on their vacations: the vacation is oriented toward a future remembering-self. But perhaps it is just as well that humans were made this way. If I made my decisions based on what was most pleasant to do in the moment, I doubt I would have made my way through Kant.This is just a short summary of the book, which certainly does not do justice to the richness of Kahneman’s many insights, examples, and arguments. What can I possibly add? Well, I think I should begin with my few criticisms. Now, it is always possible to criticize the details of psychological experiments—they are artificial, they mainly use college students, etc. But considering the logistical restraints of doing research, I thought that Kahneman’s experiments were all quite expertly done, with the relevant variables controlled and additional work performed to check for competing explanations. So I cannot fault this.What bothered me, rather, was that Kahneman was profuse in diagnosing cognitive errors, but somewhat reticent when it came to the practical ramifications of these conclusions, or to strategies to mitigate these errors. He does offer some consequences and suggestions, but these are few and far between. Of course, doing this is not his job, so perhaps it is unfair to expect anything of the kind from Kahneman. Still, if anyone is equipped to help us deal with our mental quagmires, he is the man.This is a slight criticism. A more serious shortcoming was that his model of the mind fails to account for a ubiquitous experience: boredom. According to Kahneman’s rough sketch, System 1 is pleased by familiarity, and System 2 is only activated (begrudgingly, and without much relish) for unfamiliar challenges. Yet there are times when familiarity can be crushing and when novel challenges can be wonderfully refreshing. The situation must be more subtle: I would guess that we are most happy with moderately challenging tasks that take place against a familiar background. In any case, I think that Kahneman overstated our intellectual laziness.Pop psychology—if this book can be put under that category—is a genre I dip into occasionally. Though there is a lot of divergence in emphasis and terminology, the consensus is arguably more striking. Most authors seem to agree that our conscious mind is rather impotent compared to all of the subconscious control exerted by our brains. Kahneman’s work in the realm of judgments closely parallels Johathan Haidt’s work in morals: that our conscious mind mostly just passively accepts verdicts handed up from our mental netherworld. Indeed, arguably this was Freud’s fundamental message, too. Yet it is so contrary to all of our conscious experiences (as, indeed, it must be) that it still manages to be slightly disturbing.Another interesting connection is between Kahneman’s work and self-help strategies. It struck me that these cognitive errors are quite directly related to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which largely consists of getting patients to spot their own mental distortions (most of which are due to our mind’s weakness with statistics) and correct them. And Kahneman’s work on experiential and remembered well being has obvious relevance to the mindfulness movement—strategies for switching our attention from our remembering to our experiencing “self.” As you can see from these connections, Kahneman’s research is awfully rich.Though perhaps not as amazing as the blurbs would have you believe, I cannot help but conclude that this is a thoroughly excellent book. Kahneman gathers many different strands of research together into a satisfying whole. Who would have thought that a book about all the ways that I am foolish would make me feel so wise?"

I've been working on this book since September or August (4-6 months) and just could not take reading it for more than a few minutes at a time. Many times did it put me to sleep. The book covered a lot of great material and really fascinating research, but oftentimes in such plodding, pedantic, meticulous detail as to nearly obfuscate the point. I have heard of the majority of the research (or at least their conclusions) as well, so while I thought it offered excellent insight and useful material for a lot of people to learn, I didn't think this collection of it--more of a history of the field than an introduction--added anything novel or unique for one already well-versed in the material. I guess I didn't care for the details in how the studies were conducted for every minor point in the author's theories--though I largely agreed with the theories and interpretations. A line near the end of the book struck a dissonant chord with me and I wonder if that offers an additional cause for my dislike: ""That was my reason for writing a book that is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than to decision makers."" I wouldn't count myself among 'decision makers' in any important sense (it's surprising how little responsibility a person can have sometimes!), but I often felt like the book wasn't speaking to me. Many times the author wrote ""we think..."" or ""we act..."" in such a way that I don't think I'd do. This isn't to say I'm a purely 'rational agent' or 'Econ' or anything like that--the majority of the authors theories (thinking can be either instinctual or effortful, rational agents act differently than emotional humans, and the experiencing self and the remembering self are different things) are immanently true--but I do think he was generalizing for a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) audience, and despite my background, I don't think I think that way. Recommendation: read the introduction and the conclusion (and perhaps the major section intros), cherry-pick anything else of interest. "

80,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,2," Mr. Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner, explores the general subject of how and why we frequently make irrational decisions. We've all seen articles over the years on various aspects of this phenomenon, but I venture to say that never before have the various aspects and permutations been explored in this depth and specificity. Mr. Kahneman has spent much of his life researching the subject, and since the book includes both his research and that of others, it must stand as the definitive compendium on the subject. His credentials are indisputable, and he tries gamely to bring the subject to life, but -- mea culpa -- I just couldn't stay interested in the myriad of data and specific examples. The book is good for someone really interested in the details, and it does contain real life examples, but after 400 pages it's hard to remember them. My takeaway: Our intuition is frequently wrong, and even our experience (or what we believe our experience to have been) may not be reliable as a decision guide. So, be careful!"

83,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,4,"A long book that requires real mental exertion, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a worthwhile read by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman. It delves into the two complex systems of the mind. System 1 is impulsive, emotional, and often led astray, while System 2 is rational, thoughtful, and takes more time to makes decisions. He analyzes how humans use (and sometimes fail to use) both systems, and the resulting implications on topics ranging from how we perceive happiness to behavioral economics.Thinking, Fast and Slow is one of the most in-depth Psychology books I've read. I fell in love with the subject after taking AP Psychology last year as a junior in high school, and am currently craving more books and articles related to the field. Daniel Kahneman satisfied my thirst. I had a solid understanding of some concepts beforehand, like the confirmation bias and hindsight bias, but had never heard of other terms like base rate or the illusion of validity. The sheer amount of statistics and experiments referenced throughout the book proved Kahneman's thoroughness and dedication.I recommend Thinking, Fast and Slow to anyone who wants to learn about how we think, or about psychology in general. I liked how Kahneman progressed from simple ideas like heuristics to more complex concepts, like prospect theory. Even if you have no background in psychology or economics, a mere interest in either should suffice for this book.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

A text like this is especially instructive when you consider yourself an ""outside-the-norm"" person; it comes and beats you with a vengeance, time and again, as you try the mental problems inside for yourself--and fail and fail and fail. A lesson in humility, indeed. :)I was particularly happy to find out:- why a single quarrel can ruin a friendship of many years- what is the ratio of positive to negative experiences that makes us perceive a relationship as ""successful""- to what extent we weigh potential losses more than potential gains- how much and why we value our experiences: duration vs intensity- why we at the Human Library lost four fifths of our subscribers when we switched from an opt-out mailing list to an opt-in one... and on and on and on. The book is unusually compact and concrete.Definitely worth our time."
85,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,5,"I feel this book richly deserves its status. Kahneman has handed over the rich & surprising fruits of a lifetime of creative thought and research, in a well-organised book free of academiese (hurrah!) He also makes the material interactive by inviting us to do little mental activities to illustrate his simple study methods and assist the delight of recognition that makes this such an enjoyable read.One of his goals is to provide ways to talk about and tackle some everyday problems by considering the way we think as two interacting systems, and to point out the weaknesses and mistakes that arise from ways these tend to (co)operate. He frankly admits that it is easier to see others' sub-optimal performance than our own, and the tools he offers are generally for 'water-cooler talk' or gossiping about co-workers and negotiation partners. This is a lot better than it sounds, I promise!I would have to type out almost the entire book to share all the insights that impressed me, but I will pick out a few of my favourite themes:People use an 'availability heuristic' to make judgements about how often things occur - if you can think of a lot of examples of something, you tend to assume it is common. This makes us vulnerable to subtle propaganda techniques, and gives rise to an uncritical conflation of what-is-in-the-news with what-is-happening-in-the-world. Kahneman points out that we tend to ignore absent evidence: what-you-see-is-all-there-is (WYSIATI)People do not behave 'rationally' when faced with many types of wager that map onto real life decisions. Most people, in fact, behave in predictably irrational ways. Economic models that treat people as rational agents ('Econs') are deeply flawed. Which is a shame, because economists are using those modelsIntuition is not magic. People who are very experienced and highly trained have the ability to process sense data and make snap decisions before going through the laborious work of stringing verbal thoughts or calculations together. This works well in many situations: for firefighters, sportspeople, medics etc. However, there is a tendency to overinflate the importance of hunches and intuitions in other situations, particularly stock market trading, where Kahneman's statistical analysis shows that people (even experienced workers) are worse than computer programs, and even WORSE THAN RANDOM CHOICE at predicting and picking winners and losers.Perhaps especially in Euro-USian white culture, most of us tend to privilege our 'remembering self' over our 'experiencing self'. We tend to care disproportionately about the end of a story, and the ends of people's lives. People asked whether they would bother going on holiday if they had to have the memory of the holiday erased at the end of it often say they wouldn't. Kahneman's (very gentle!) experiments on pain showed that privileging the remembering self resulted in people choosing to experience MORE pain because of the way the experience was presented. He suggests that giving more thought to the experiencing self could improve life for many people. This echoes the concept of mindfulness that is important in some cultural traditions, therapies and religious practices. A friend pointed out that it was similar to Zen.So, that's your taster; I strongly recommend the whole smorgasbord. I'll definitely be reading this again."

The book is filled with shady experiments on undergraduates and psychology grad students and wild extrapolations of the associated results. I find it exceedingly difficult to take many of the conclusions seriously. I can't read into them. I can't trust them. I can't base my decisions on them and I resist incorporating them into my world view with anything more than 0.01 weight. In fact, several of the experiments that this book mentions were also found to be not reproducible by a recent meta-study on reproducibility in psychology studies.Here's a characteristic example of me reading the book. The author says: ""Consider the word EAT. Now fill in the blank in the following: SO_P. You were much more likely to fill in the blank with a U to make SOUP than with an A to make soap! How amazing. We call this phenomenon priming, system 1, something something"". In fact, no, SOAP came to my mind immediately.All I could think about when I read this book is my own experience of participating in a friend's psychology study once. He designed an experiment and asked me to do some things and answer some questions, but at some point it became extremely clear to me what the experiment was about, or how he hoped I would behave. I went along with it, but I couldn't believe that this would eventually become part of a paper. It was a joke. I'm afraid you can't go through a similar experience and take these studies seriously from then on.All that being said I do find the broad strokes of the system1/system2 division proposed in this book to be interesting and appealing. A small few of the examples were fun to contemplate, and it was okay. 3/5, aborting reading."

As I read it, page after page was covered in notes, 'yes' 'no' 'really?' 'but'....What Kahneman discusses in this book is something we've all known in a less rigorous way, perhaps - the intuitive and the analytical paths to decision making and action.Two SystemsPsychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the two modes of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2.System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.The labels of System 1 and System 2 are widely used in psychology, but I go further than most in this book, which you can read as a psychodrama with two characters.Surely you chess and bridge players are already sitting up and paying attention. We all know about that psychodrama. He continues:When we think if ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book. I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 general surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1. You will be invited to think of the two systems as agents with their individual abilities, limitations, and functions.Of course this hasn't been written with game players in mind, and you may, like me, find yourself disagreeing with some of the ideas here. For a start, System 1 is based on the infinite hard work of System 2. As far as playing games go, you aren't born with S1, it grows and improves because of S2. However, it is definitely food for thought and may help clarify aspects of how you are thinking and how you might address issues.Educational and sometimes astonishing when it comes to how bad we humans are at dealing with data.

91,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859963-suhrob,5,"In ""Thinking, fast and slow"" the Nobel laureate Danny Kahneman summarizes his life long work mostly done with his collegue (and Nobel corecipient) Amos Tversky in the field of cognitive psychology and decision making.There has been an outcrop of books on this topic in the recent years (Ariely and Lehrer being the bigger names) and there is a significant overlap with similar books. However, for the seriously interested I'd recommend to start here. This is the original reference, the user manual for your brain.The scope of the book is large but Kahneman tries to make the topics more accessible by anthropomorphising the two cognitive ""systems"" in interplay in human decision making (though giving them the non descript names ""1"" and ""2""). The chapters end with examples (""soundbites"") where the introduced concepts are used in real life settings. This attempt at accessibility is, in my opinion, undermined by the 400 page tome which might be too intimidating to some. But I can understand the tension between trying to be influential and trying to summarize a whole field and life long work.Apart from that, the book is very lean, you won't find any cutesy stories or participatory journalism. Just concept after concept and the relevant research. But don't let that discourage you - the book is well written and structured. I consider the lack of fluff a big plus.Kahneman is skeptical that even learning about all these cognitive biases can make a change on individual level, but hopes something can be done on institutional level. The whole thing is a bit saddening. We are really running on a to me still very impressive, but at the same time, very flawed system. The sheer scope how irrelevant factors influence our decision making even on highest levels is frightening.I am generally very optimistic about the future of humanity and would love to be around to see where it goes, but if we get there, if we are ever to make it, it will be only with a lots of luck.An essential book."

95,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Kahneman divides the way we think into two “systems”. These are not actual entities, but constructs that represent distinct modes of thought. System 1 is our intuitive sense covering ideas and feelings that just pop into our heads without effort. System 2 is our reasoning, rational sense that we use when we deliberately think things through. He offers many different scenarios that determine whether System 1 or System 2 is engaged. Realizing that this determination itself is often automatic can leave you feeling a little less in control. Kahneman shows us how many ways our thinking can go off track. Our immediate thoughts occur by association, resemblance to the familiar or because they represent our expectations. We jump to conclusions because it is the easiest thing to do. Our minds have an inherent laziness. We often stick with the first thought that comes to mind even though the situation calls for engaging System 2. If a question is just too hard for System 1, System 1 will make it simpler so we can forgo the mental work of engaging System 2.`Even when System 2 does engage, System 1 can subvert it without us being aware. Priming is the effect of being influenced by prior unrelated information. For example, Kahneman points to experiments that show just hearing something about money makes our subsequent behavior more self-centered. Anchoring refers to hearing or seeing a fact that sets a beginning point for evaluation of a subsequent problem. Just putting a number in the mind can make it a starting point for thinking about anything that comes next. Setting targets unrealistically high or low is used by negotiators to make their real goals seem more reasonable. Representativeness is about using stereotypes or imputing one quality from another similar to the halo effect. The halo effect occurs when current opinions often formed by System 1 shape subsequent judgements even if they are about something completely unrelated. For example if you find someone personable you are more likely to think they are also generous. Availability refers to anything that we hear repeatedly, which will be quickly recalled and used by System 1. And of course any judgement, snap or not, is subject to our emotions and mood. Preceding unrelated events may change the decisions we make. While System 1 operates at the WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) level ignoring information not immediately at hand, it can add things that are not there. It imputes motive and intent. It postulates connections between events. When System 1 is challenged by limited information it fills in the blanks. This may be very useful in some situations, but it also leads to unsupported assumptions and conspiracy theories.Most people tend to overconfidence in their judgement. We think we know more than we do. We underestimate randomness and put too much faith in patterns that are often temporary or simply imagined. We ignore baselines of activity and are overly influenced by recent events even though reversion to the mean is typically a better predictor of future outcomes. Intuition can be helpful but only when used by experts in fields where statistically significant correlations exist. Kahneman challenges conventional economic theory that assumes people are rational when they buy or sell. He identifies many influences that make economic decisions subjective. Key is loss aversion vs. gain. Losses are more psychologically painful and thus fear of them overweight decisions to avoid them. Context is very important. The significance of the amount to your personal situation matters. Just owning something increases its value to the owner. Framing is important. The language describing a transaction will invoke a System 1 response. Preceding transactions alter perception of the value of subsequent ones. Kahneman gives many more examples and decimates the notion of the rational consumer.Another fascinating concept concerns how we view our lives. Are we the experienced self or the remembered self? The experienced self consists of our feelings as we lived them, the other as they are remembered. The two are different. A twenty year marriage that was happy for 19 out of twenty years is very positive for the experienced self, but if the marriage ended in a bitter divorce it might all be remembered very negatively. A more mundane example is choosing a vacation. Do you choose a familiar place you know you like or a more stressful one that will create memories? The way we remember our lives does not match the way we lived them.Clearly this is a book to shake up your sense of self, and if you are like me you will enjoy the challenge. It also helps us to understand others and our relationships, although Kahneman doesn’t specifically target that aspect. I couldn’t keep from thinking of how System 1 and System 2 applied to people’s thinking in this year’s presidential election. Kahneman’s presentation is clear even for something as tricky as Bayesian analysis. My notes above cover only a small sample of the ideas in the book. I think most readers will find something to appreciate. Highly recommended. "
96,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,2,"Daniel Kahneman is a psychology professor at Princeton University who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on decision making. His book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is a journey through his theories with a primary focus on the business world and its failure to adequately apply statistical information to its predictive practices. What you should know, you ambitious soul, prior to picking up this work, is that the man is going to harsh your buzz and take great evil joy in doing it.Professor Kahneman suggests there are two systems in operation when we think. System One is quick, intuition-based and emotional. System Two is more deliberately analytical. Most decisions are made by System One because, according to Kahneman, System Two is a lazy goose and prefers not to exert the effort. That laziness is the reason we put our (misguided) faith in instinct, skill, confidence, expertise, personal experience and our own judgment when, really, we should confine ourselves to consulting the relevant available statistics. Just look at the facts, Jack. Stop indulging in the fantasy that you properly understand the past or can in any way predict the future. Forget what you think you know. You don't. You can't. And Kahneman, through chapters and chapters of interactive exercise and discourse, goes a long way toward proving this.Lots of people who know far more than I do about behavioral economics like this book and are five-star impressed by the material. Alas, I'm a visceral kid, so my considerations here are going to be a little off the statistical beaten path. For instance, Kahneman relays a story about a speaking engagement he once had with a group of investment advisers. Given a spreadsheet conveying the choices made by twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers over the course of eight consecutive years, the professor performs his calculations and proves to the top executives that financial expertise played no part in the outcome of those investments. Predictive acumen was absent. To quote: ""The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill."" Kahneman continues:The next morning we reported the findings to the advisers, and their response was equally bland. Their own experience of exercising careful judgment on complex problems was far more compelling to them than an obscure statistical fact. When we were done, one of the executives I had dined with the previous evening drove me to the airport. He told me, with a trace of defensiveness, ""I have done very well for the firm and no one can take that away from me."" I smiled and said nothing. But I thought, ""Well, I took it away from you this morning. If your success was due mostly to chance, how much credit are you entitled to take from it?""Now this interests me, this trollish glee. It interests and informs me. It also calls to mind several recent studies done in the area of clinical depression. Results are beginning to emerge to suggest those who suffer from this dark and pernicious despair may actually have a better grip on reality than those who don't. The depressed may indeed be seeing the world more clearly than the rest, and this may be why they're depressed - which brings to light the possibly essential role of denial in our lives. What we are able to repress on a daily basis - the inevitability of death, loss, sickness, natural and unnatural disaster; the random and entirely arbitrary nature of the universe; the cruelty of man; the unfairness of society, the powerlessness of the individual to effect measurable change - may indeed preserve our psychic well-being. Ignorance may not merely be bliss, it may be what's keeping us sane.Which is not to say, of course, that we shouldn't keep exploring and investigating and uncovering new truths. And it's not to say we should ignore the progress being made in all fields of endeavor. What draws my attention here is Kahneman's System One conveyance of his information - which seems pat, hubristic and ill-considered to me. He may have come up with certain statistical realities that illuminate the folly of our confidence in our own decision-making capacities. He may be correct in characterizing our faith in ourselves as ""delusional optimism."" But he doesn't go the extra mile of engaging the System Two segment of his brain to analyze the function such ""blind"" self-assurance may serve in regard to psychic health - a knowledge which sets up the much more intriguing question of whether it's more important to be right in the world, or right with it.Hey, we're all human. And, as it turns out, Kahneman's more human than most. But seriously, Professor, seriously...I could have done without that very high horse."
97,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow is an extremely well researched book - in fact painstakingly so. The book starts with a basic premise: we think fast at times based on intuition, and slow where more analysis is required. After discussing the concept in fair detail, the book goes on to list with excellent examples thinking biases especially with fast thinking. The examples are a mix of basic math, every day experiences, economic theory and others. There are also towards the end examples of satisfaction with life. This is a book which needs to be read slowly though and is a very serious read - it is very detailed in it's treatment."
98,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12520565-richard,2,"Kahneman is a brilliant thinker who's small experiments cracked the foundations of neo-classical/rational choice theory. His collections like Choices, Values and Frames are terrific reading, full of extraordinarily disorienting observations of actual human behavior. That said, this book was a bit of a disappointment. In this book, Kahneman weaves together a series of ideas based on his experiments and the experiments of like-minded researchers, and the effect is underwhelming. Gone is the careful exploration of small twists in human behavior, replaced with broad, rolling declarations that are only weakly supported by the data. For most of the experiments he cites, he fails to talk about the power of the findings (were participants 40% more likely to do something when framed a certain way? Or 4% more likely? Or 400%?). Sure, this is a book for a wider audience than his journal articles or academic collections, but I found that the dumbing down went too far. Too bad. The basic research that made Kahneman a star is fabulous. Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice is a great example - a review of experiments involving no more than some college students and coffee mugs, with counterintuitive findings about loss and market prices. Kahneman is at his best when he lets the reader figure out the implications of his stunning findings.Also, his dual process theory of thought - System 1 and System 2 - seems the less powerful of two competing views of human reason. A skeptic might ask what evidence is there that System 2 exists at all. System 2 certainly seems to be no less vulnerable to confirmation bias than System 1. The Mercier and Sperber formulation on the function of human reason just fits better with evolutionary models. Of course, that's probably just my confirmation bias kicking in."

If there is something I truly HATE is the self-importance of “behavioral experiments” or “psychological tests” applied to the behavior of groups of people. You know, for example when a test group is asked to press a button under certain conditions, or state their feelings while watching some images, etc. I don’t have any doubts: I just think they are bullshit, pure and simple. And psychology is NOT a science. I wouldn’t have gone to the lengths of researching this further, but on page 57 the authors come up with the following ridiculous display of hubris :  “The results of these experiments are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THESE STUDIES ARE TRUE.” Haha! Prompted by this rather odd, childish statement, I decided to do a little research of my own, and .... it turns out that only 2 years ago a thorough study (now become very famous in the field) proved that:1) the specific experiment quoted in this book called “ego depletion” is complete bunk. 2) unsurprisingly, the VAST MAJORITY of these experiments have a very serious “reproducibility problem”. Hence, they cannot be considered “science”, or anything remotely leading us to “undeniably true conclusions”. The principles underlying the experiments are true enough, but not because they are proved by the experiments. It’s because they are “elegantly presented common sense”.

He uses a multitude of examples and cases to illustrate the points he makes. The difficulty is rather in us, the readers. Kahneman's thesis, abundantly supported, is that all of us operate on two levels. Anyone who is at all familiar with psychology and research into the brain knows about our ""lizard brain."" Kahneman shows how this part of our makeup operates at a level far beyond the fight or flight response, affecting our everyday lives in ways that we are totally unaware of. More than that, it affects our reasoning processes in ways that I never imagined. And though one can peruse the text easily enough, it is very, very difficult to make the application to one's own thought processes. Kahneman makes it plain that we could all benefit from a greater degree of self-awareness and disciplined thinking that takes into account these unconscious influences, but actually applying that is hard. That said, his book explains a lot about how easily we are manipulated, and why we so often draw the wrong conclusions from our experience. He also accounts for ""experts"" who are so often wrong and why the future is so unpredictable."

Our teacher said it is a fascinating book and some other people I know had kind words to say about it as well; thus, I had high hopes for the book.I found the book tremendously tedious. There is too much text for all the points the author makes. Most of the time, I didn't even delve into the problem questions, which used way too much mathematical intuition.Now I understand why teachers don't want us to use 'you' form in essays.

That is a slow, engrossing grind of an academic tome, though.All the reviews have been glowing. Kahneman is golden, of course — he's ascended into the pantheon of the intelligentsia's demigods. The first one I read was from The Economist, then there was the one from the New York Times, and then I caught the one in The Wilson Quarterly, but what finally made really this the zeitgeist was when I came across a review in the fluffy “Paper” magazine (I was sitting in a coffeeshop waiting for some friends to finish a boardgame and picked up a free copy. More pop culture snuck into my brain in that twenty minutes than I permitted during the balance of 2011.)May 8th 2012 Update: The Economist chimes in with an aside: Foreign languages and thinking: Oprima dos for better cognition, in which they report on evidence that some of our cognitive flaws don't seem to interfere when we ponder the decision in a non-native language."

It's so chock full of fantastic ideas, insights, and information that I'm afraid even trying to comment on it will make me look like a fool.Let me just say, then, that Thinking Fast and Slow is absolutely fascinating, a book worth reading and rereading, especially if you're of the self-improvement, self-examining type. Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner for his work in Behavioral Economics has a fascinating mind, and I felt like I had a front-row seat to one of the most incredible lectures about decision making, heuristics, and judgment that had ever been given.And here's where I start to worry about sounding like a fool: this just isn't my field of expertise. Sure, I love learning and I consider myself to be, in many respects, an autodidact. But Thinking Fast and Slow is, if I'm not mistaken, a summary of all of Kahneman's work from the last fifty years (or more?). It's gobstoppingly dense with studies Kahneman and his fellow researchers have devised to examine who people think, and I quell the thought of trying to comment on it.But I will gladly comment about it. Thinking Fast and Slow has been, over the weeks that I've been reading it, easily the book I've recommended most, and I admit having to suppress some excitement when someone tells me that they've ordered the book from Amazon. Even if you don't like economics, or maybe especially if you don't like economics, Kahneman's research is accessible to anyone with even a modicum of interest in society, decision-making, or how we think and exercise judgment. Rather than describe the world in terms of complex equations and graphs--though there are certainly a lot of graphs--Kahneman seems to be constantly devising thought experiments to understand how and why people act in certain situations. What a life it must be to be Kahneman, self-tasked with identifying the 'how' and 'why' of any particular decision, whether it is discerning who the best candidates are for officer training from among a cadre of soldiers during field exercises, or figuring out how to redesign the food pyramid to be a food pie, there seems to be no end of topics or situations where behavioral economics can be applied with some revelatory success.One part of especial interest to me was the section, near the end, when Kahneman begins to describe memory, pain, and suffering. If I understand right, Kahneman makes the point that research shows that it isn't the measurement of pleasure, happiness, or well-being over the duration of an event--such as a surgery, marriage, or vacation--that matters so much as how the event ends that we remember. Even if the event was, for the most part, a wonderful or positive experience we still remember the event based on how it ends. Shakespeare might put this as ""All's well that ends well."" For me, it's a paradigm-shifting insight about the importance not only of getting things right but also ending things right. How we remember things is, essentially, flawed, and what we are left with in memory often conflicts with what the experience was as a whole.Anyway, 
Thinking Fast and Slow 
is a great book. Prospect theory, framing, reference points, loss versus gain, and more are all raised and addressed and explored, and I am sure I will return to it again soon. I think I probably read it far too quickly, too eager to absorb concepts, and I feel there's more here to understand and examine."
104,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,2,"Have started skipping pages and chapters, seeking the really intriguing insights, which seem, most often, to be research other than that of Dr. Kahneman. Dr. Kahneman can devote most of a chapter to how he saved standardized tests for the Israeli military in the 1960´s. I think modesty is a big problem for him.Also, while it´s hard to imagine an academic community once utterly in thrall of perfect rationality, game theory, etc., the fact that mankind is not rational by rigid standards of logic now feels like a truism, and listing traps in statistical judgment that students fall into doesn´t make working rationality any more or less true. I sense that Dr. Kahneman also knows this.Like a book about the human brain I was picking through at roughly the same time, this is really a series of short papers written over quite a long time. It's likely that they contradict each other and somehow convey the illusion of complexity in the process.Is this the place to talk about problems with statistics as a science? Because Dr. Kahneman loves statistics, and wherever people fail at statitistics, Dr. Kahneman considers them irrational. This is self-serving, because he takes pains to point out that writers of statistics textbooks make basic statistical errors. He himself says he forgets to use large enough samples in studies sometimes.I attended a university which dedicated entire courses to the soft science of statistical failure, and then required I take those courses. One absolutely soporific professor Dr. Kahneman praises a great deal stood in front of my class and ""proved"" that statistically there is no reason to vote. Another ""proved"" that attacking Iraq was George Bush's only option in the Gulf War.Dr. Kahneman likes to say that a few simple measures are better than expert opinion. This is self-serving again, because results are measured by the same simple metrics. So, for example, experts are asked to predict the likelihood of a very limited number of distinctly defined options, multiple choice style. Or, in an example such as that of predicting the market for wine, the same growing conditions which are used to grade the quality of wine are used to predict its market value in the growing season. What a shock.This review is in danger of becoming as diffuse and confusing as the book. As another review points out, the book is fast and loose with statistics itself and essentially plays all sides of the field at once. I did browse some of the academic papers in the appendix and they weren't remarkable more consistent. It would be interesting to see the peer review process for those papers.Without having experienced the stifling milieu of absolute rationality in social sciences, I imagine we should be grateful for the comparative freedom Dr. Kahneman gave some students in the 50s. Still, per my update, the concluding pages of the book nearly sound like fascism. If statistics is the magical order of the universe, only to be discovered and worshipped by the select elite, well, the Dr. tells us that governments and companies, which are magically immune from (statistical) failures should be doing all of our thinking for us."
105,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"I've long wondered about the ""rational man"" of economic theory and have wondered if there was some kind of drug I could take that would enable me to be that person. And what did it mean that I--fully aware of my emotion-based spending (or, more likely, not spending) decisions--seemed, as a Prius owner, to be much more rational than the majority of American car buyers with their acceptance of insanely low mpg's?Having read this book, I now believe that the rational man of economic theory needs to be read out of the human race. (S)he has no more validity than the forecasting models that failed to predict the crash of 2008. For all practical purposes, as this book shows, we make judgments with our emotions *first*--and don't call on rationality unless we have to. Perhaps this is why Kahneman calls it System 1 (our ""just the facts ma'am"" side is System 2). Real thinking is hard work, and we are all slackers. We indulge in halo effects, we want to make correlations causative, we're easily influenced by extraneous sensory factors--the list of reason-dodging practices is an extensive one for which this book serves as a catalog.I spend a lot of time in board meetings as a result of my job. Even though the meetings aren't as dysfunctional as the ones in Dilbert, nonetheless I'm often disturbed by the pronounced unevenness of influence: those who express their opinions most often are the most influential; others keep their opinions to themselves until the final vote and then go along. I was delighted, then, when I saw this sentence: ""The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them."" Kahneman suggests a simple solution, which is simply to have everyone write down, before a meeting, a ""very brief summary of their position.""I might not be able to get this rule adopted. But if others fail to see its obvious wisdom, you can bet they will all be Hummer drivers."

Every day, since the moment I started reading Thinking, Fast and Slow, I have either referenced it in a conversation or have noticed a situation, explained in the book.Thinking, Fast and Slow contains all the psychological wisdom the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman has gathered through the years. He’s almost 80 years old, this makes for a lot of wisdom.The goal of the book is to give us names to the most common errors of judgement we make. In addition to the names there are a ton of amusing stories and insights into how our mind works.While most of the content isn’t unique, the value of the book is in its completeness. It covers all aspects of the way humans make decisions, both right and wrong.If you ever make any decisions or plans in your life, I think you will enjoy it."

It identifies our lazy shortcuts that cause bad decision-making. The book has lots of cool brain tricks and optical illusions too that make for good party tricks. I had hard almost all of the research before at some point, but it was condensed and explained in a better way. At parts, it started to drag and become repetitive and there were also a few logical leaps (yes, even them), but all in all, a must read."

In 2011 he published the best-seller, ""Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow"", a summary of his lifetimes work.DK has proved that our thinking patterns aren't half as smart as we might like to think they are. Our emotions like to think fast; in other words, jump to conclusions based on few facts and little analysis, leading to a belief that may well be largely irrational. Our intellect likes to think slowly, sifting facts, weighing judgements, possibly deciding the evidence is insufficient to reach any conclusion."
111,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"I don’t know how this book tastes like, it felt like a long night of cheese and wine maybe; sober. I couldn’t write a review easily, it took me a while to read, to ponder and now to write.Why this book? I am fascinated by decision making science (it was the subject of my Master’s thesis) and I am always looking for behavioral economics books such as Ariely’s and Taleb’s. Truth is, I don’t think I’ve read a better book about decision making; it is simply a psychological masterpiece. Kahneman is brilliant. The author (who is a Nobel Prize winner), in this book, attempts to deliver very complex scientific and detailed ideas about the human mind in a simplified way. The main idea of the book is that the human brain runs over 2 systems. System 1 “the automatic” is the intuitive and fast whereas system 2 is the slow thinker. These 2 systems are supposed to assist us with living this life , however they might cause us some problems because sometimes we need system 2 to do the work and system 1 is the one taking a decision. Here is an example, what is 2+2? Now what is 17x24? Well the answer to the first question is executed by system 1 whereas the second is by system 2.“System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgements you make.”When the answer is easy, we rarely double check with system 2. Here is a mind puzzling example he gives: (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.How much does the ball cost? _____ cents System 1 would immediately say 0.1, whereas the true answer is 0.05 (Do it on a paper). As a result, the quick fast system 1 might take shortcuts that are wrong while making a decision. There are several examples and at each I was amazed. Kahneman repeatedly labels system 2 as “lazy”: “We don’t want to think rigorously about something” that’s why most of the decisions are rather chosen easily and based on hunch or impression.The book is long 500 pages so I will just pinpoint a few ideas worth sharing: -	Avaliability Heuristic: We tend to make our choices based on the data available to us. People tend to highlight importance on easily retrieved data from memory. Kahneman indicates that most readilty available data is from memory. -	Priming: priming is also about what information we have before making a decision. For example, if you recently heard the word EAT, you are more likely to solve the word fragment SO_P by SOUP. But if you heard the word WASH, you’re most likely going to say SOAP. Priming occurs in system 1. -	Cognitive Ease: it is a cause and consequence of a pleasant feeling. A happy mood loosens the control of system2 over performance, when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. -	The halo effect: our tendency to judge a person or thing as good or bad even on things we haven’t obsereved. -	WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is.What I loved about the book is that it is more evidence of the simplicity of our brains (or stupidity) and how easily manipulated and fragile they are. We are far less rational than we think we are. Kahneman shows us all that through examples of simple everyday decisions. The book definietley doesn’t flow and it took me about 6 months to finish, sipping it and digesting it slowly. Don’t get me wrong, the style is simple but the content is heavy that you really would feel the need to put it down and ponder on the thought. The book changes your perception immediately. It made me question my previously made decisions, my feelings, my knowledge and definitely made me think more when I have system 1 kicking in for easily reachable answers. I recommend this book as a must read, but in case 500 pages is too much for you, read the chapters of “Overconfidence”, “Choices” and “Two Selves”. "
112,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,4,"If you are interested in learning more about how the brain works, which you should be, you need to read this book. This book treats with a fair amount of academic rigor the subjects that ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell addresses with anecdotes. This book covers research that Kahneman conducted over his career, including research which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. This book will destroy much of your confidence in your own cognitive functioning and decision-making processes, then give you the tools you need to step back and rebuild those processes in a more rational way. This takes deliberate effort, as you will see in this book if you are not already familiar with the various cognitive biases and heuristics our minds employ to interpret the vast stream of incoming data.Kahneman begins by describing two systems of cognitive function - System 1, which operates quickly, emotionally, and subconsciously, and System 2, which operates slowly, consciously, and logically. The rest of the book is written within the framework of these two systems.Next, Kahneman describes a series of cognitive biases and heuristics that are responsible for our frequent struggles to think rationally and logically. Many of these involve our minds' failures to accurately apply statistical thinking to decision-making, and they account for many of our ""snap judgments"" which turn out to be baseless and false. We are afflicted by MANY cognitive biases, and this book is not exhaustive, but it does a great job of describing and discussing the several that it presents. If you are interested in a quick, easy overview of a broader range of these cognitive biases, check out You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney. This book is by no means academically rigorous as Kahneman's book is, but provides a much broader overview of these errors in our thought processes.Kahneman goes on to discuss Prospect Theory (for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics) in the context of these two systems. He delves a bit into behavioral economics and explains how and why humans differ in their behavior from the perfectly rational ""Econ"" that is the subject of study in the field of Economics. He also discusses how to avoid some of the shortcomings of our fast, subconscious thought processes in our day-to-day lives.Finally, Kahneman takes the two-system model and expands it into a ""two-self"" model with an ""experiential self"" and a ""remembered self."" He discusses these two selves in the context of multiple experiments he conducted to try to study happiness and comes to a rather astonishing conclusion about the impacts of duration and intensity of unpleasant events on perceived unpleasantness. The bottom line: we all (ostensibly) have brains, and we all struggle (to vastly varying degrees) on a day to day basis to make good decisions, to think logically and rationally, and to maximize our own happiness. If you want to get better at doing these things, read this book."

Well, I decided to think slow and read this treacherous tedious demon of a book and there was nothing in this book I wouldn't have gotten from reading the first few chapters.The only circumstances I would recommend this book is if I was starting a book club and I wanted the book club to fail.

115,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37980042-andy,5,"Great read. I enjoyed it just as much as I had enjoyed Rolf Dobelli's The Art of Thinking Clearly which I reference often when it comes to fallacies. Kahneman's metaphorical division of the mental life into two systems, fast and slow, makes the book quite interesting no matter how much one has read about the brain, mind, cognition and emotions. The goa, as Kahneman puts it, is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. Memory, he writes is and attribute of System 1, while deliberate checking and search are characteristics of System 2. Hence: ""Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.""My favorite quote from the book, perhaps because it is relevant to the current global, socio-political issues is this: ""A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."""
116,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577651-said-almaskery,4,The only reason I didn't give the book a 5 star is its length. The book is excellent in all aspects and tries to explain our biases and natural tendancies towards specific acts. Unfortunately that such books might not be very useful unless you read it in certain context and try to apply some of its main observations of the humans thinking patterns. I was initially introduced to the book in a negotiations skills course in London business School. This was my context.

118,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,5,"This is quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read. Not because the author attempts to make it that way, but just because of the implications. I shelved in under horror somewhat in jest, but I really do think that the book is Lovecraftian--not in the tentacles and unpronounceable names sense, but in the cosmic horror and nihilism sense:The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of CthulhuThat ""inability to correlate its contents"" is really what Thinking, Fast and Slow is about.Let me explain. The main thesis of the book is that decision making and evaluation of the world can primarily be sorted into two broad processes in the mind, which Kahneman calls ""System 1"" and ""System 2."" System 1 is intuitive, uses heuristics to evaluate information, is effortless, only deals with current information (WYSIATI, or ""What You See Is All There Is""), constructs causal narratives, and fast. System 2 is contemplative, judges based on logic, requires effort to engage, separates events properly, and is slow. Hence the book's title.Note that these terms don't refer to any single identifiable brain structure or thought process. They're simply ways of categorizing how the brain works.After a brief explanation of these systems, the rest of the book is a gigantic litany of all the ways in which humans are, essentially, buffeted by subconscious processes over which they have no control. And I use that phrase deliberately, because there are multiple examples of psychologists, including Kahneman himself, falling victim to the cognitive disortions depicted therein, even when they know about them and even directly after having exactly what they did wrong explained to them.The main reason for that is that thinking is hard. Most of the time, System 1 is good enough, especially for our savannah-dwelling hominid ancestors, and System 2 requires much more energy than relying on System 1, so we're reluctant to engage in it unless absolutely necessary and take basically every opportunity to switch back to System 1.So, here are some examples:The Halo Effect: How one's judgement of a person's actions is influenced by their overall character. If you like your boss, you're likely to interpret their sticking to a plan in the face of adversity as being even-tempered, cautious, persistent, and thoughtful. If you don't like them, you're likely to view the exact same actions as rigid, stubborn, and tyrannical. Another example is how more attractive people tend to be thought of as kinder or more intelligent than less attractive people even in the absence of evidence.Priming: Priming is changing estimates or judgements based on information that may not have anything to do with the judgement. The major example in the book is a wheel of fortune rigged to stop at either 10 or 65, and after spinning it, participants would be asked how many African countries are members of the U.N. The average answer for people who got a 10 was 25, and the average for people who got a 65 was 45. More disturbingly, judges with an average of fifteen years' experience rolled weighted dice designed to get either 3 or 9 before evaluating cases to determine sentencing. If the dice got 3, the average sentence was 5 months. If it was 9, it was 8 months.Endowment Effect: Owning something is better than not owning it, and getting it is better than giving it away. One example given is a oenophile who refuses to buy wine at more than $30 and refuses to sell it at more than $100. According to economic theory, that makes no sense. Well, it does--once bought, it has additional value since now it's owned, and owning something is more powerful than not owning it. Though it is pointed out that this doesn't tend to apply to cash or to retailers and their stock, since their possessors view them only as means to an end and not owned goods in and of themselves.Hindsight Bias: This is the tendency to see events that have already happened as being inevitable, even if they were unpredictable beforehand, and more generally as a tendency to edit memories in response to newly-provided information. This often shows up in accidents, where people suffer blame far out of proportion to the probability of the accident, and is especially damaging in trials, where juries will tend to assume that the probabilities of events are higher than they actually were. That also leads decision-makers to spend a large amount of resources on materials and policies to deflect blame, even if it makes things objectively worse (zero-tolerance policies at schools, for example)Regression to the Mean: Great successes tend to be followed by disappointing performance and dismal failure tends to be followed by improvement simply because over time, there are more incidents closer to the average than not. This can cause undue suffering, as in the example given of Israeli pilots. The instructor mentions the criticism is better than praise, because pilots tend to improve after they're criticized and get worse after they're praised. However, this isn't causal, it's just regression to the mean, and considering other research on praise vs. criticism, it's actively detrimental.Risk Aversion: People rate losses as worse than gains, and evaluate chances based not on their probability, but as weighted by whether it's a gain or loss. Furthermore, they tend to prefer certainty on gains, but will seek out risk over certainty for losses. As an example, consider two offers: in one, you can take $250 for sure or have a 30% chance to get $1000 and a 70% chance to get nothing, and in the other you can lose $700 for sure or have a 75% chance to lose $750 and a 25% chance to lose nothing. Most people will take the $250 on the first example and risk the gamble in the second, even though a strict accounting of probability would indicate it should be the other way around.Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect: Experiences are not evaluated in memory objectively. Instead, only two things tend to be considered--the highest (or lowest) single point, and the condition at the end. How long the experience lasted doesn't matter at all. In one example, an experimenter mentioned a certain women who had died of cancer at age 30 or age 60 after having lived a happy life. People were asked to evaluate her life, and the 30-year and 60-year groups generally rated it the same quality even though one was twice as long. However, when she lived 35 years or 65 years, and the last 5 years were not as happy as the preceding years, her quality of life was rated lower than the 30- or 60-year versions even though the total time was longer. These biases are also why people in new relationships after an acrimonious breakup tend to assume their new relationship is orders of magnitude better than their previous one, even if they had many happy years together before its end, simply because it ended badly.Cognitive Energy: Engaging System 2 takes effort, literally, and we try to avoid it when we don't want to. Furthermore, we're worse at it when depleted of energy. In one highly depressing example, a group of judges evaluating parole cases were studied, and it was found that the probability of them granting parole was directly proportional to how long it had been since they last ate. When they started for the day, the rate was 65% of cases granted parole, but right before lunch it was almost 0. That means that how hungry the judge was has a higher influence on parole applications than the merits of the case!WYSIATI: System 1 doesn't take any information into account other than what is directly in front of it, even if using System 2 makes it obvious that that information is highly relevant. One example is dolphins vs. orphans. The experimenter asked a group of people how much money they would donate to charity in two separate cases--saving dolphins and saving orphans. If the examples were given singly, then the average amount given to dolphins was almost three times the amount given to orphans. If they were given together, though, then the amount given to orphans beat the amount given to dolphins because now there was a new piece of information--orphans are human, dolphins are not--that previously was ignored because even though it was highly relevant, it wasn't part of the problem presented.Feminist Bank Teller: I don't remember the formal name for this one either, but it's an error of categorization. People were presented with a description of a person, including that she was outspoken, active in women's rights organizations, brash, etc., and then asked what careers she was likely to join. ""Feminist bank teller"" was weighted higher than ""bank teller"" both on lists where they appeared singly and when they appeared together, even though all feminist bank tellers are also bank tellers and therefore bank teller must be higher probability. A similar problem can be seen with coin flips. Most people will rate THHHTH as a more likely sequence than THHH, even though the first sequence is simply the second one with extra tosses added and therefore can only be less likely.There are literally dozens of other examples I haven't mentioned, because the review simply doesn't have enough space and anyway, there's already a book (and reams of psychology research) about it. And you should read it. Everyone should read it. Everyone should know about what is going on in their mind without their knowledge.Though one warning: Thinking, Fast and Slow is extremely dense. As another review mentions, it's not always clear whether he's writing this book for psychologists or a lay audience, and some parts may require several read-throughs to figure out what Kahneman is saying and the implications thereof.Then again, maybe that's just because System 2 is lazy and dumping things onto System 1.It's not automatically as horrible as I make it out. Kahneman specifically emphasizes that our minds are set up this way because the vast majority of the time, it's good enough to function and survive. To me, though, this really is Lovecraftian--in Lovecraft's stories it was alien races and sleeping deities manipulating humanity without humanity's knowledge, and here it's the unconscious processes in our own mind. I value rationality very highly and do my best to try to be rational, but this book makes a very good case that rationality is literally impossible except in certain specific cases, and it can't be sustained since System 2 takes energy, and the more energy you use, the more likely System 2 is to give up and dump everything back on System 1 even if you know about all of these cognitive errors.So, you might find this book horribly depressing, like I did, or you may find it inspiring, like someone else I know, who said that knowing about all the natural errors in human cognition is the first step in developing a way to fix them. But either way, you should read it, because there's little that's more important to understand than the workings of your own mind."
119,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446434-hundeschlitten,2,"There are some interesting ideas here, but why do so many of these left-brain science types insist on writing their own books? Like a lot of generalized overviews written by some expert in his or her field, Daniel Kahneman's survey of the current ideas surrounding behavioral economics was a real chore to slog through at times. The book is broken into five sections and, at least to me, things really didn't start getting interesting until section three. In the first two sections, there are just too many experiments Kahneman felt the need to summarize, almost all demonstrating some way in which our decision making is less than entirely efficient. At times, I felt like I was plodding across the written equivalent of the Oregon Trail, with no end in sight. In Part Three, Kahneman begins to use these experiments to dismantle the concepts of the Chicago school of economics, which is based on the concept that we are all rational actors. But then Kahneman accepts the theory of ""highly efficient markets"" as a given, which makes no sense if their participants aren't being rational. So even here, Kahneman loses me. But at least he's being topical.Part Four features more experiments, most of which attempt to find ways in which you can trick otherwise intelligent people into making non-sensible decisions.Part Five is the most intellectually interesting part of the book, as Kahneman posits an experiencing self and a remembering self, and what this implies about how we make decisions. So unless you read very quickly, my advice is to begin at page 199, and feel free to skim some of the chapters (which are numerous but mercifully short) until you get to the final section on the two selves, which begins on page 377.

As I read it, page after page was covered in notes, 'yes' 'no' 'really?' 'but'....What Kahneman discusses in this book is something we've all known in a less rigorous way, perhaps - the intuitive and the analytical paths to decision making and action.Two SystemsPsychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the two modes of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2.System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.The labels of System 1 and System 2 are widely used in psychology, but I go further than most in this book, which you can read as a psychodrama with two characters.Surely you chess and bridge players are already sitting up and paying attention. We all know about that psychodrama. He continues:When we think if ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book. I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 general surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1. You will be invited to think of the two systems as agents with their individual abilities, limitations, and functions.Of course this hasn't been written with game players in mind, and you may, like me, find yourself disagreeing with some of the ideas here. For a start, System 1 is based on the infinite hard work of System 2. As far as playing games go, you aren't born with S1, it grows and improves because of S2. However, it is definitely food for thought and may help clarify aspects of how you are thinking and how you might address issues.Educational and sometimes astonishing when it comes to how bad we humans are at dealing with data.

121,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859963-suhrob,5,"In ""Thinking, fast and slow"" the Nobel laureate Danny Kahneman summarizes his life long work mostly done with his collegue (and Nobel corecipient) Amos Tversky in the field of cognitive psychology and decision making.There has been an outcrop of books on this topic in the recent years (Ariely and Lehrer being the bigger names) and there is a significant overlap with similar books. However, for the seriously interested I'd recommend to start here. This is the original reference, the user manual for your brain.The scope of the book is large but Kahneman tries to make the topics more accessible by anthropomorphising the two cognitive ""systems"" in interplay in human decision making (though giving them the non descript names ""1"" and ""2""). The chapters end with examples (""soundbites"") where the introduced concepts are used in real life settings. This attempt at accessibility is, in my opinion, undermined by the 400 page tome which might be too intimidating to some. But I can understand the tension between trying to be influential and trying to summarize a whole field and life long work.Apart from that, the book is very lean, you won't find any cutesy stories or participatory journalism. Just concept after concept and the relevant research. But don't let that discourage you - the book is well written and structured. I consider the lack of fluff a big plus.Kahneman is skeptical that even learning about all these cognitive biases can make a change on individual level, but hopes something can be done on institutional level. The whole thing is a bit saddening. We are really running on a to me still very impressive, but at the same time, very flawed system. The sheer scope how irrelevant factors influence our decision making even on highest levels is frightening.I am generally very optimistic about the future of humanity and would love to be around to see where it goes, but if we get there, if we are ever to make it, it will be only with a lots of luck.An essential book."

125,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Kahneman divides the way we think into two “systems”. These are not actual entities, but constructs that represent distinct modes of thought. System 1 is our intuitive sense covering ideas and feelings that just pop into our heads without effort. System 2 is our reasoning, rational sense that we use when we deliberately think things through. He offers many different scenarios that determine whether System 1 or System 2 is engaged. Realizing that this determination itself is often automatic can leave you feeling a little less in control. Kahneman shows us how many ways our thinking can go off track. Our immediate thoughts occur by association, resemblance to the familiar or because they represent our expectations. We jump to conclusions because it is the easiest thing to do. Our minds have an inherent laziness. We often stick with the first thought that comes to mind even though the situation calls for engaging System 2. If a question is just too hard for System 1, System 1 will make it simpler so we can forgo the mental work of engaging System 2.`Even when System 2 does engage, System 1 can subvert it without us being aware. Priming is the effect of being influenced by prior unrelated information. For example, Kahneman points to experiments that show just hearing something about money makes our subsequent behavior more self-centered. Anchoring refers to hearing or seeing a fact that sets a beginning point for evaluation of a subsequent problem. Just putting a number in the mind can make it a starting point for thinking about anything that comes next. Setting targets unrealistically high or low is used by negotiators to make their real goals seem more reasonable. Representativeness is about using stereotypes or imputing one quality from another similar to the halo effect. The halo effect occurs when current opinions often formed by System 1 shape subsequent judgements even if they are about something completely unrelated. For example if you find someone personable you are more likely to think they are also generous. Availability refers to anything that we hear repeatedly, which will be quickly recalled and used by System 1. And of course any judgement, snap or not, is subject to our emotions and mood. Preceding unrelated events may change the decisions we make. While System 1 operates at the WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) level ignoring information not immediately at hand, it can add things that are not there. It imputes motive and intent. It postulates connections between events. When System 1 is challenged by limited information it fills in the blanks. This may be very useful in some situations, but it also leads to unsupported assumptions and conspiracy theories.Most people tend to overconfidence in their judgement. We think we know more than we do. We underestimate randomness and put too much faith in patterns that are often temporary or simply imagined. We ignore baselines of activity and are overly influenced by recent events even though reversion to the mean is typically a better predictor of future outcomes. Intuition can be helpful but only when used by experts in fields where statistically significant correlations exist. Kahneman challenges conventional economic theory that assumes people are rational when they buy or sell. He identifies many influences that make economic decisions subjective. Key is loss aversion vs. gain. Losses are more psychologically painful and thus fear of them overweight decisions to avoid them. Context is very important. The significance of the amount to your personal situation matters. Just owning something increases its value to the owner. Framing is important. The language describing a transaction will invoke a System 1 response. Preceding transactions alter perception of the value of subsequent ones. Kahneman gives many more examples and decimates the notion of the rational consumer.Another fascinating concept concerns how we view our lives. Are we the experienced self or the remembered self? The experienced self consists of our feelings as we lived them, the other as they are remembered. The two are different. A twenty year marriage that was happy for 19 out of twenty years is very positive for the experienced self, but if the marriage ended in a bitter divorce it might all be remembered very negatively. A more mundane example is choosing a vacation. Do you choose a familiar place you know you like or a more stressful one that will create memories? The way we remember our lives does not match the way we lived them.Clearly this is a book to shake up your sense of self, and if you are like me you will enjoy the challenge. It also helps us to understand others and our relationships, although Kahneman doesn’t specifically target that aspect. I couldn’t keep from thinking of how System 1 and System 2 applied to people’s thinking in this year’s presidential election. Kahneman’s presentation is clear even for something as tricky as Bayesian analysis. My notes above cover only a small sample of the ideas in the book. I think most readers will find something to appreciate. Highly recommended. "
126,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,2,"Daniel Kahneman is a psychology professor at Princeton University who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on decision making. His book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is a journey through his theories with a primary focus on the business world and its failure to adequately apply statistical information to its predictive practices. What you should know, you ambitious soul, prior to picking up this work, is that the man is going to harsh your buzz and take great evil joy in doing it.Professor Kahneman suggests there are two systems in operation when we think. System One is quick, intuition-based and emotional. System Two is more deliberately analytical. Most decisions are made by System One because, according to Kahneman, System Two is a lazy goose and prefers not to exert the effort. That laziness is the reason we put our (misguided) faith in instinct, skill, confidence, expertise, personal experience and our own judgment when, really, we should confine ourselves to consulting the relevant available statistics. Just look at the facts, Jack. Stop indulging in the fantasy that you properly understand the past or can in any way predict the future. Forget what you think you know. You don't. You can't. And Kahneman, through chapters and chapters of interactive exercise and discourse, goes a long way toward proving this.Lots of people who know far more than I do about behavioral economics like this book and are five-star impressed by the material. Alas, I'm a visceral kid, so my considerations here are going to be a little off the statistical beaten path. For instance, Kahneman relays a story about a speaking engagement he once had with a group of investment advisers. Given a spreadsheet conveying the choices made by twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers over the course of eight consecutive years, the professor performs his calculations and proves to the top executives that financial expertise played no part in the outcome of those investments. Predictive acumen was absent. To quote: ""The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill."" Kahneman continues:The next morning we reported the findings to the advisers, and their response was equally bland. Their own experience of exercising careful judgment on complex problems was far more compelling to them than an obscure statistical fact. When we were done, one of the executives I had dined with the previous evening drove me to the airport. He told me, with a trace of defensiveness, ""I have done very well for the firm and no one can take that away from me."" I smiled and said nothing. But I thought, ""Well, I took it away from you this morning. If your success was due mostly to chance, how much credit are you entitled to take from it?""Now this interests me, this trollish glee. It interests and informs me. It also calls to mind several recent studies done in the area of clinical depression. Results are beginning to emerge to suggest those who suffer from this dark and pernicious despair may actually have a better grip on reality than those who don't. The depressed may indeed be seeing the world more clearly than the rest, and this may be why they're depressed - which brings to light the possibly essential role of denial in our lives. What we are able to repress on a daily basis - the inevitability of death, loss, sickness, natural and unnatural disaster; the random and entirely arbitrary nature of the universe; the cruelty of man; the unfairness of society, the powerlessness of the individual to effect measurable change - may indeed preserve our psychic well-being. Ignorance may not merely be bliss, it may be what's keeping us sane.Which is not to say, of course, that we shouldn't keep exploring and investigating and uncovering new truths. And it's not to say we should ignore the progress being made in all fields of endeavor. What draws my attention here is Kahneman's System One conveyance of his information - which seems pat, hubristic and ill-considered to me. He may have come up with certain statistical realities that illuminate the folly of our confidence in our own decision-making capacities. He may be correct in characterizing our faith in ourselves as ""delusional optimism."" But he doesn't go the extra mile of engaging the System Two segment of his brain to analyze the function such ""blind"" self-assurance may serve in regard to psychic health - a knowledge which sets up the much more intriguing question of whether it's more important to be right in the world, or right with it.Hey, we're all human. And, as it turns out, Kahneman's more human than most. But seriously, Professor, seriously...I could have done without that very high horse."
127,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow is an extremely well researched book - in fact painstakingly so. The book starts with a basic premise: we think fast at times based on intuition, and slow where more analysis is required. After discussing the concept in fair detail, the book goes on to list with excellent examples thinking biases especially with fast thinking. The examples are a mix of basic math, every day experiences, economic theory and others. There are also towards the end examples of satisfaction with life. This is a book which needs to be read slowly though and is a very serious read - it is very detailed in it's treatment."
128,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12520565-richard,2,"Kahneman is a brilliant thinker who's small experiments cracked the foundations of neo-classical/rational choice theory. His collections like Choices, Values and Frames are terrific reading, full of extraordinarily disorienting observations of actual human behavior. That said, this book was a bit of a disappointment. In this book, Kahneman weaves together a series of ideas based on his experiments and the experiments of like-minded researchers, and the effect is underwhelming. Gone is the careful exploration of small twists in human behavior, replaced with broad, rolling declarations that are only weakly supported by the data. For most of the experiments he cites, he fails to talk about the power of the findings (were participants 40% more likely to do something when framed a certain way? Or 4% more likely? Or 400%?). Sure, this is a book for a wider audience than his journal articles or academic collections, but I found that the dumbing down went too far. Too bad. The basic research that made Kahneman a star is fabulous. Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice is a great example - a review of experiments involving no more than some college students and coffee mugs, with counterintuitive findings about loss and market prices. Kahneman is at his best when he lets the reader figure out the implications of his stunning findings.Also, his dual process theory of thought - System 1 and System 2 - seems the less powerful of two competing views of human reason. A skeptic might ask what evidence is there that System 2 exists at all. System 2 certainly seems to be no less vulnerable to confirmation bias than System 1. The Mercier and Sperber formulation on the function of human reason just fits better with evolutionary models. Of course, that's probably just my confirmation bias kicking in."
129,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,3,"This is a comment on a specific element of the book, and not a review of the whole work. If there is something I truly HATE is the self-importance of “behavioral experiments” or “psychological tests” applied to the behavior of groups of people. You know, for example when a test group is asked to press a button under certain conditions, or state their feelings while watching some images, etc. I don’t have any doubts: I just think they are bullshit, pure and simple. And psychology is NOT a science. I wouldn’t have gone to the lengths of researching this further, but on page 57 the authors come up with the following ridiculous display of hubris :  “The results of these experiments are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THESE STUDIES ARE TRUE.” Haha! Prompted by this rather odd, childish statement, I decided to do a little research of my own, and .... it turns out that only 2 years ago a thorough study (now become very famous in the field) proved that:1) the specific experiment quoted in this book called “ego depletion” is complete bunk. 2) unsurprisingly, the VAST MAJORITY of these experiments have a very serious “reproducibility problem”. Hence, they cannot be considered “science”, or anything remotely leading us to “undeniably true conclusions”. The principles underlying the experiments are true enough, but not because they are proved by the experiments. It’s because they are “elegantly presented common sense”. Here is an article about the study. Enjoy. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_..."

He uses a multitude of examples and cases to illustrate the points he makes. The difficulty is rather in us, the readers. Kahneman's thesis, abundantly supported, is that all of us operate on two levels. Anyone who is at all familiar with psychology and research into the brain knows about our ""lizard brain."" Kahneman shows how this part of our makeup operates at a level far beyond the fight or flight response, affecting our everyday lives in ways that we are totally unaware of. More than that, it affects our reasoning processes in ways that I never imagined. And though one can peruse the text easily enough, it is very, very difficult to make the application to one's own thought processes. Kahneman makes it plain that we could all benefit from a greater degree of self-awareness and disciplined thinking that takes into account these unconscious influences, but actually applying that is hard. That said, his book explains a lot about how easily we are manipulated, and why we so often draw the wrong conclusions from our experience. He also accounts for ""experts"" who are so often wrong and why the future is so unpredictable."

You might have started off reading very carefully to get the point of every sentence, but as your reading progressed you got more and more bored, and finally you were flying your eyes over the last pages.That was the case with this book - we had to read it for our psychology class. Our teacher said it is a fascinating book and some other people I know had kind words to say about it as well; thus, I had high hopes for the book.I found the book tremendously tedious. There is too much text for all the points the author makes. Most of the time, I didn't even delve into the problem questions, which used way too much mathematical intuition.Now I understand why teachers don't want us to use 'you' form in essays. I couldn't stand his use of 'you' forms as if he thought he could read our minds. Most of the things he talked about were obvious anyway."

Hey, at least I was reading Kahneman before he won that Nobel Prize, before he got really popular. But I have to admit I never actually finished his Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases — it was due back at the library when I was only halfway through. That is a slow, engrossing grind of an academic tome, though.All the reviews have been glowing. Kahneman is golden, of course — he's ascended into the pantheon of the intelligentsia's demigods. The first one I read was from The Economist, then there was the one from the New York Times, and then I caught the one in The Wilson Quarterly, but what finally made really this the zeitgeist was when I came across a review in the fluffy “Paper” magazine (I was sitting in a coffeeshop waiting for some friends to finish a boardgame and picked up a free copy. More pop culture snuck into my brain in that twenty minutes than I permitted during the balance of 2011.)May 8th 2012 Update: The Economist chimes in with an aside: Foreign languages and thinking: Oprima dos for better cognition, in which they report on evidence that some of our cognitive flaws don't seem to interfere when we ponder the decision in a non-native language."

Thinking Fast and Slow
. It's so chock full of fantastic ideas, insights, and information that I'm afraid even trying to comment on it will make me look like a fool.Let me just say, then, that Thinking Fast and Slow is absolutely fascinating, a book worth reading and rereading, especially if you're of the self-improvement, self-examining type. Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner for his work in Behavioral Economics has a fascinating mind, and I felt like I had a front-row seat to one of the most incredible lectures about decision making, heuristics, and judgment that had ever been given.And here's where I start to worry about sounding like a fool: this just isn't my field of expertise. Sure, I love learning and I consider myself to be, in many respects, an autodidact. But Thinking Fast and Slow is, if I'm not mistaken, a summary of all of Kahneman's work from the last fifty years (or more?). It's gobstoppingly dense with studies Kahneman and his fellow researchers have devised to examine who people think, and I quell the thought of trying to comment on it.But I will gladly comment about it. Thinking Fast and Slow has been, over the weeks that I've been reading it, easily the book I've recommended most, and I admit having to suppress some excitement when someone tells me that they've ordered the book from Amazon. Even if you don't like economics, or maybe especially if you don't like economics, Kahneman's research is accessible to anyone with even a modicum of interest in society, decision-making, or how we think and exercise judgment. Rather than describe the world in terms of complex equations and graphs--though there are certainly a lot of graphs--Kahneman seems to be constantly devising thought experiments to understand how and why people act in certain situations. What a life it must be to be Kahneman, self-tasked with identifying the 'how' and 'why' of any particular decision, whether it is discerning who the best candidates are for officer training from among a cadre of soldiers during field exercises, or figuring out how to redesign the food pyramid to be a food pie, there seems to be no end of topics or situations where behavioral economics can be applied with some revelatory success.One part of especial interest to me was the section, near the end, when Kahneman begins to describe memory, pain, and suffering. If I understand right, Kahneman makes the point that research shows that it isn't the measurement of pleasure, happiness, or well-being over the duration of an event--such as a surgery, marriage, or vacation--that matters so much as how the event ends that we remember. Even if the event was, for the most part, a wonderful or positive experience we still remember the event based on how it ends. Shakespeare might put this as ""All's well that ends well."" For me, it's a paradigm-shifting insight about the importance not only of getting things right but also ending things right. How we remember things is, essentially, flawed, and what we are left with in memory often conflicts with what the experience was as a whole.Anyway, 
Thinking Fast and Slow 
is a great book. Prospect theory, framing, reference points, loss versus gain, and more are all raised and addressed and explored, and I am sure I will return to it again soon. I think I probably read it far too quickly, too eager to absorb concepts, and I feel there's more here to understand and examine."
134,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,2,"Have started skipping pages and chapters, seeking the really intriguing insights, which seem, most often, to be research other than that of Dr. Kahneman. Dr. Kahneman can devote most of a chapter to how he saved standardized tests for the Israeli military in the 1960´s. I think modesty is a big problem for him.Also, while it´s hard to imagine an academic community once utterly in thrall of perfect rationality, game theory, etc., the fact that mankind is not rational by rigid standards of logic now feels like a truism, and listing traps in statistical judgment that students fall into doesn´t make working rationality any more or less true. I sense that Dr. Kahneman also knows this.Like a book about the human brain I was picking through at roughly the same time, this is really a series of short papers written over quite a long time. It's likely that they contradict each other and somehow convey the illusion of complexity in the process.Is this the place to talk about problems with statistics as a science? Because Dr. Kahneman loves statistics, and wherever people fail at statitistics, Dr. Kahneman considers them irrational. This is self-serving, because he takes pains to point out that writers of statistics textbooks make basic statistical errors. He himself says he forgets to use large enough samples in studies sometimes.I attended a university which dedicated entire courses to the soft science of statistical failure, and then required I take those courses. One absolutely soporific professor Dr. Kahneman praises a great deal stood in front of my class and ""proved"" that statistically there is no reason to vote. Another ""proved"" that attacking Iraq was George Bush's only option in the Gulf War.Dr. Kahneman likes to say that a few simple measures are better than expert opinion. This is self-serving again, because results are measured by the same simple metrics. So, for example, experts are asked to predict the likelihood of a very limited number of distinctly defined options, multiple choice style. Or, in an example such as that of predicting the market for wine, the same growing conditions which are used to grade the quality of wine are used to predict its market value in the growing season. What a shock.This review is in danger of becoming as diffuse and confusing as the book. As another review points out, the book is fast and loose with statistics itself and essentially plays all sides of the field at once. I did browse some of the academic papers in the appendix and they weren't remarkable more consistent. It would be interesting to see the peer review process for those papers.Without having experienced the stifling milieu of absolute rationality in social sciences, I imagine we should be grateful for the comparative freedom Dr. Kahneman gave some students in the 50s. Still, per my update, the concluding pages of the book nearly sound like fascism. If statistics is the magical order of the universe, only to be discovered and worshipped by the select elite, well, the Dr. tells us that governments and companies, which are magically immune from (statistical) failures should be doing all of our thinking for us."

And what did it mean that I--fully aware of my emotion-based spending (or, more likely, not spending) decisions--seemed, as a Prius owner, to be much more rational than the majority of American car buyers with their acceptance of insanely low mpg's?Having read this book, I now believe that the rational man of economic theory needs to be read out of the human race. (S)he has no more validity than the forecasting models that failed to predict the crash of 2008. For all practical purposes, as this book shows, we make judgments with our emotions *first*--and don't call on rationality unless we have to. Perhaps this is why Kahneman calls it System 1 (our ""just the facts ma'am"" side is System 2). Real thinking is hard work, and we are all slackers. We indulge in halo effects, we want to make correlations causative, we're easily influenced by extraneous sensory factors--the list of reason-dodging practices is an extensive one for which this book serves as a catalog.I spend a lot of time in board meetings as a result of my job. Even though the meetings aren't as dysfunctional as the ones in Dilbert, nonetheless I'm often disturbed by the pronounced unevenness of influence: those who express their opinions most often are the most influential; others keep their opinions to themselves until the final vote and then go along. I was delighted, then, when I saw this sentence: ""The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them."" Kahneman suggests a simple solution, which is simply to have everyone write down, before a meeting, a ""very brief summary of their position.""I might not be able to get this rule adopted. But if others fail to see its obvious wisdom, you can bet they will all be Hummer drivers."

In 2011 he published the best-seller, ""Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow"", a summary of his lifetimes work.DK has proved that our thinking patterns aren't half as smart as we might like to think they are. Our emotions like to think fast; in other words, jump to conclusions based on few facts and little analysis, leading to a belief that may well be largely irrational. Our intellect likes to think slowly, sifting facts, weighing judgements, possibly deciding the evidence is insufficient to reach any conclusion."
141,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"I don’t know how this book tastes like, it felt like a long night of cheese and wine maybe; sober. I couldn’t write a review easily, it took me a while to read, to ponder and now to write.Why this book? I am fascinated by decision making science (it was the subject of my Master’s thesis) and I am always looking for behavioral economics books such as Ariely’s and Taleb’s. Truth is, I don’t think I’ve read a better book about decision making; it is simply a psychological masterpiece. Kahneman is brilliant. The author (who is a Nobel Prize winner), in this book, attempts to deliver very complex scientific and detailed ideas about the human mind in a simplified way. The main idea of the book is that the human brain runs over 2 systems. System 1 “the automatic” is the intuitive and fast whereas system 2 is the slow thinker. These 2 systems are supposed to assist us with living this life , however they might cause us some problems because sometimes we need system 2 to do the work and system 1 is the one taking a decision. Here is an example, what is 2+2? Now what is 17x24? Well the answer to the first question is executed by system 1 whereas the second is by system 2.“System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgements you make.”When the answer is easy, we rarely double check with system 2. Here is a mind puzzling example he gives: (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.How much does the ball cost? _____ cents System 1 would immediately say 0.1, whereas the true answer is 0.05 (Do it on a paper). As a result, the quick fast system 1 might take shortcuts that are wrong while making a decision. There are several examples and at each I was amazed. Kahneman repeatedly labels system 2 as “lazy”: “We don’t want to think rigorously about something” that’s why most of the decisions are rather chosen easily and based on hunch or impression.The book is long 500 pages so I will just pinpoint a few ideas worth sharing: -	Avaliability Heuristic: We tend to make our choices based on the data available to us. People tend to highlight importance on easily retrieved data from memory. Kahneman indicates that most readilty available data is from memory. -	Priming: priming is also about what information we have before making a decision. For example, if you recently heard the word EAT, you are more likely to solve the word fragment SO_P by SOUP. But if you heard the word WASH, you’re most likely going to say SOAP. Priming occurs in system 1. -	Cognitive Ease: it is a cause and consequence of a pleasant feeling. A happy mood loosens the control of system2 over performance, when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. -	The halo effect: our tendency to judge a person or thing as good or bad even on things we haven’t obsereved. -	WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is.What I loved about the book is that it is more evidence of the simplicity of our brains (or stupidity) and how easily manipulated and fragile they are. We are far less rational than we think we are. Kahneman shows us all that through examples of simple everyday decisions. The book definietley doesn’t flow and it took me about 6 months to finish, sipping it and digesting it slowly. Don’t get me wrong, the style is simple but the content is heavy that you really would feel the need to put it down and ponder on the thought. The book changes your perception immediately. It made me question my previously made decisions, my feelings, my knowledge and definitely made me think more when I have system 1 kicking in for easily reachable answers. I recommend this book as a must read, but in case 500 pages is too much for you, read the chapters of “Overconfidence”, “Choices” and “Two Selves”. "
142,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,4,"If you are interested in learning more about how the brain works, which you should be, you need to read this book. This book treats with a fair amount of academic rigor the subjects that ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell addresses with anecdotes. This book covers research that Kahneman conducted over his career, including research which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. This book will destroy much of your confidence in your own cognitive functioning and decision-making processes, then give you the tools you need to step back and rebuild those processes in a more rational way. This takes deliberate effort, as you will see in this book if you are not already familiar with the various cognitive biases and heuristics our minds employ to interpret the vast stream of incoming data.Kahneman begins by describing two systems of cognitive function - System 1, which operates quickly, emotionally, and subconsciously, and System 2, which operates slowly, consciously, and logically. The rest of the book is written within the framework of these two systems.Next, Kahneman describes a series of cognitive biases and heuristics that are responsible for our frequent struggles to think rationally and logically. Many of these involve our minds' failures to accurately apply statistical thinking to decision-making, and they account for many of our ""snap judgments"" which turn out to be baseless and false. We are afflicted by MANY cognitive biases, and this book is not exhaustive, but it does a great job of describing and discussing the several that it presents. If you are interested in a quick, easy overview of a broader range of these cognitive biases, check out You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney. This book is by no means academically rigorous as Kahneman's book is, but provides a much broader overview of these errors in our thought processes.Kahneman goes on to discuss Prospect Theory (for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics) in the context of these two systems. He delves a bit into behavioral economics and explains how and why humans differ in their behavior from the perfectly rational ""Econ"" that is the subject of study in the field of Economics. He also discusses how to avoid some of the shortcomings of our fast, subconscious thought processes in our day-to-day lives.Finally, Kahneman takes the two-system model and expands it into a ""two-self"" model with an ""experiential self"" and a ""remembered self."" He discusses these two selves in the context of multiple experiments he conducted to try to study happiness and comes to a rather astonishing conclusion about the impacts of duration and intensity of unpleasant events on perceived unpleasantness. The bottom line: we all (ostensibly) have brains, and we all struggle (to vastly varying degrees) on a day to day basis to make good decisions, to think logically and rationally, and to maximize our own happiness. If you want to get better at doing these things, read this book."

I enjoyed it just as much as I had enjoyed Rolf Dobelli's The Art of Thinking Clearly which I reference often when it comes to fallacies. Kahneman's metaphorical division of the mental life into two systems, fast and slow, makes the book quite interesting no matter how much one has read about the brain, mind, cognition and emotions. The goa, as Kahneman puts it, is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. Memory, he writes is and attribute of System 1, while deliberate checking and search are characteristics of System 2. Hence: ""Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.""My favorite quote from the book, perhaps because it is relevant to the current global, socio-political issues is this: ""A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."""

148,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,5,"This is quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read. Not because the author attempts to make it that way, but just because of the implications. I shelved in under horror somewhat in jest, but I really do think that the book is Lovecraftian--not in the tentacles and unpronounceable names sense, but in the cosmic horror and nihilism sense:The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of CthulhuThat ""inability to correlate its contents"" is really what Thinking, Fast and Slow is about.Let me explain. The main thesis of the book is that decision making and evaluation of the world can primarily be sorted into two broad processes in the mind, which Kahneman calls ""System 1"" and ""System 2."" System 1 is intuitive, uses heuristics to evaluate information, is effortless, only deals with current information (WYSIATI, or ""What You See Is All There Is""), constructs causal narratives, and fast. System 2 is contemplative, judges based on logic, requires effort to engage, separates events properly, and is slow. Hence the book's title.Note that these terms don't refer to any single identifiable brain structure or thought process. They're simply ways of categorizing how the brain works.After a brief explanation of these systems, the rest of the book is a gigantic litany of all the ways in which humans are, essentially, buffeted by subconscious processes over which they have no control. And I use that phrase deliberately, because there are multiple examples of psychologists, including Kahneman himself, falling victim to the cognitive disortions depicted therein, even when they know about them and even directly after having exactly what they did wrong explained to them.The main reason for that is that thinking is hard. Most of the time, System 1 is good enough, especially for our savannah-dwelling hominid ancestors, and System 2 requires much more energy than relying on System 1, so we're reluctant to engage in it unless absolutely necessary and take basically every opportunity to switch back to System 1.So, here are some examples:The Halo Effect: How one's judgement of a person's actions is influenced by their overall character. If you like your boss, you're likely to interpret their sticking to a plan in the face of adversity as being even-tempered, cautious, persistent, and thoughtful. If you don't like them, you're likely to view the exact same actions as rigid, stubborn, and tyrannical. Another example is how more attractive people tend to be thought of as kinder or more intelligent than less attractive people even in the absence of evidence.Priming: Priming is changing estimates or judgements based on information that may not have anything to do with the judgement. The major example in the book is a wheel of fortune rigged to stop at either 10 or 65, and after spinning it, participants would be asked how many African countries are members of the U.N. The average answer for people who got a 10 was 25, and the average for people who got a 65 was 45. More disturbingly, judges with an average of fifteen years' experience rolled weighted dice designed to get either 3 or 9 before evaluating cases to determine sentencing. If the dice got 3, the average sentence was 5 months. If it was 9, it was 8 months.Endowment Effect: Owning something is better than not owning it, and getting it is better than giving it away. One example given is a oenophile who refuses to buy wine at more than $30 and refuses to sell it at more than $100. According to economic theory, that makes no sense. Well, it does--once bought, it has additional value since now it's owned, and owning something is more powerful than not owning it. Though it is pointed out that this doesn't tend to apply to cash or to retailers and their stock, since their possessors view them only as means to an end and not owned goods in and of themselves.Hindsight Bias: This is the tendency to see events that have already happened as being inevitable, even if they were unpredictable beforehand, and more generally as a tendency to edit memories in response to newly-provided information. This often shows up in accidents, where people suffer blame far out of proportion to the probability of the accident, and is especially damaging in trials, where juries will tend to assume that the probabilities of events are higher than they actually were. That also leads decision-makers to spend a large amount of resources on materials and policies to deflect blame, even if it makes things objectively worse (zero-tolerance policies at schools, for example)Regression to the Mean: Great successes tend to be followed by disappointing performance and dismal failure tends to be followed by improvement simply because over time, there are more incidents closer to the average than not. This can cause undue suffering, as in the example given of Israeli pilots. The instructor mentions the criticism is better than praise, because pilots tend to improve after they're criticized and get worse after they're praised. However, this isn't causal, it's just regression to the mean, and considering other research on praise vs. criticism, it's actively detrimental.Risk Aversion: People rate losses as worse than gains, and evaluate chances based not on their probability, but as weighted by whether it's a gain or loss. Furthermore, they tend to prefer certainty on gains, but will seek out risk over certainty for losses. As an example, consider two offers: in one, you can take $250 for sure or have a 30% chance to get $1000 and a 70% chance to get nothing, and in the other you can lose $700 for sure or have a 75% chance to lose $750 and a 25% chance to lose nothing. Most people will take the $250 on the first example and risk the gamble in the second, even though a strict accounting of probability would indicate it should be the other way around.Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect: Experiences are not evaluated in memory objectively. Instead, only two things tend to be considered--the highest (or lowest) single point, and the condition at the end. How long the experience lasted doesn't matter at all. In one example, an experimenter mentioned a certain women who had died of cancer at age 30 or age 60 after having lived a happy life. People were asked to evaluate her life, and the 30-year and 60-year groups generally rated it the same quality even though one was twice as long. However, when she lived 35 years or 65 years, and the last 5 years were not as happy as the preceding years, her quality of life was rated lower than the 30- or 60-year versions even though the total time was longer. These biases are also why people in new relationships after an acrimonious breakup tend to assume their new relationship is orders of magnitude better than their previous one, even if they had many happy years together before its end, simply because it ended badly.Cognitive Energy: Engaging System 2 takes effort, literally, and we try to avoid it when we don't want to. Furthermore, we're worse at it when depleted of energy. In one highly depressing example, a group of judges evaluating parole cases were studied, and it was found that the probability of them granting parole was directly proportional to how long it had been since they last ate. When they started for the day, the rate was 65% of cases granted parole, but right before lunch it was almost 0. That means that how hungry the judge was has a higher influence on parole applications than the merits of the case!WYSIATI: System 1 doesn't take any information into account other than what is directly in front of it, even if using System 2 makes it obvious that that information is highly relevant. One example is dolphins vs. orphans. The experimenter asked a group of people how much money they would donate to charity in two separate cases--saving dolphins and saving orphans. If the examples were given singly, then the average amount given to dolphins was almost three times the amount given to orphans. If they were given together, though, then the amount given to orphans beat the amount given to dolphins because now there was a new piece of information--orphans are human, dolphins are not--that previously was ignored because even though it was highly relevant, it wasn't part of the problem presented.Feminist Bank Teller: I don't remember the formal name for this one either, but it's an error of categorization. People were presented with a description of a person, including that she was outspoken, active in women's rights organizations, brash, etc., and then asked what careers she was likely to join. ""Feminist bank teller"" was weighted higher than ""bank teller"" both on lists where they appeared singly and when they appeared together, even though all feminist bank tellers are also bank tellers and therefore bank teller must be higher probability. A similar problem can be seen with coin flips. Most people will rate THHHTH as a more likely sequence than THHH, even though the first sequence is simply the second one with extra tosses added and therefore can only be less likely.There are literally dozens of other examples I haven't mentioned, because the review simply doesn't have enough space and anyway, there's already a book (and reams of psychology research) about it. And you should read it. Everyone should read it. Everyone should know about what is going on in their mind without their knowledge.Though one warning: Thinking, Fast and Slow is extremely dense. As another review mentions, it's not always clear whether he's writing this book for psychologists or a lay audience, and some parts may require several read-throughs to figure out what Kahneman is saying and the implications thereof.Then again, maybe that's just because System 2 is lazy and dumping things onto System 1.It's not automatically as horrible as I make it out. Kahneman specifically emphasizes that our minds are set up this way because the vast majority of the time, it's good enough to function and survive. To me, though, this really is Lovecraftian--in Lovecraft's stories it was alien races and sleeping deities manipulating humanity without humanity's knowledge, and here it's the unconscious processes in our own mind. I value rationality very highly and do my best to try to be rational, but this book makes a very good case that rationality is literally impossible except in certain specific cases, and it can't be sustained since System 2 takes energy, and the more energy you use, the more likely System 2 is to give up and dump everything back on System 1 even if you know about all of these cognitive errors.So, you might find this book horribly depressing, like I did, or you may find it inspiring, like someone else I know, who said that knowing about all the natural errors in human cognition is the first step in developing a way to fix them. But either way, you should read it, because there's little that's more important to understand than the workings of your own mind."
149,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446434-hundeschlitten,2,"There are some interesting ideas here, but why do so many of these left-brain science types insist on writing their own books? Like a lot of generalized overviews written by some expert in his or her field, Daniel Kahneman's survey of the current ideas surrounding behavioral economics was a real chore to slog through at times. The book is broken into five sections and, at least to me, things really didn't start getting interesting until section three. In the first two sections, there are just too many experiments Kahneman felt the need to summarize, almost all demonstrating some way in which our decision making is less than entirely efficient. At times, I felt like I was plodding across the written equivalent of the Oregon Trail, with no end in sight. In Part Three, Kahneman begins to use these experiments to dismantle the concepts of the Chicago school of economics, which is based on the concept that we are all rational actors. But then Kahneman accepts the theory of ""highly efficient markets"" as a given, which makes no sense if their participants aren't being rational. So even here, Kahneman loses me. But at least he's being topical.Part Four features more experiments, most of which attempt to find ways in which you can trick otherwise intelligent people into making non-sensible decisions.Part Five is the most intellectually interesting part of the book, as Kahneman posits an experiencing self and a remembering self, and what this implies about how we make decisions. So unless you read very quickly, my advice is to begin at page 199, and feel free to skim some of the chapters (which are numerous but mercifully short) until you get to the final section on the two selves, which begins on page 377.

As I read it, page after page was covered in notes, 'yes' 'no' 'really?' 'but'....What Kahneman discusses in this book is something we've all known in a less rigorous way, perhaps - the intuitive and the analytical paths to decision making and action.Two SystemsPsychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the two modes of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2.System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.The labels of System 1 and System 2 are widely used in psychology, but I go further than most in this book, which you can read as a psychodrama with two characters.Surely you chess and bridge players are already sitting up and paying attention. We all know about that psychodrama. He continues:When we think if ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book. I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 general surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1. You will be invited to think of the two systems as agents with their individual abilities, limitations, and functions.Of course this hasn't been written with game players in mind, and you may, like me, find yourself disagreeing with some of the ideas here. For a start, System 1 is based on the infinite hard work of System 2. As far as playing games go, you aren't born with S1, it grows and improves because of S2. However, it is definitely food for thought and may help clarify aspects of how you are thinking and how you might address issues.Educational and sometimes astonishing when it comes to how bad we humans are at dealing with data.

151,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859963-suhrob,5,"In ""Thinking, fast and slow"" the Nobel laureate Danny Kahneman summarizes his life long work mostly done with his collegue (and Nobel corecipient) Amos Tversky in the field of cognitive psychology and decision making.There has been an outcrop of books on this topic in the recent years (Ariely and Lehrer being the bigger names) and there is a significant overlap with similar books. However, for the seriously interested I'd recommend to start here. This is the original reference, the user manual for your brain.The scope of the book is large but Kahneman tries to make the topics more accessible by anthropomorphising the two cognitive ""systems"" in interplay in human decision making (though giving them the non descript names ""1"" and ""2""). The chapters end with examples (""soundbites"") where the introduced concepts are used in real life settings. This attempt at accessibility is, in my opinion, undermined by the 400 page tome which might be too intimidating to some. But I can understand the tension between trying to be influential and trying to summarize a whole field and life long work.Apart from that, the book is very lean, you won't find any cutesy stories or participatory journalism. Just concept after concept and the relevant research. But don't let that discourage you - the book is well written and structured. I consider the lack of fluff a big plus.Kahneman is skeptical that even learning about all these cognitive biases can make a change on individual level, but hopes something can be done on institutional level. The whole thing is a bit saddening. We are really running on a to me still very impressive, but at the same time, very flawed system. The sheer scope how irrelevant factors influence our decision making even on highest levels is frightening.I am generally very optimistic about the future of humanity and would love to be around to see where it goes, but if we get there, if we are ever to make it, it will be only with a lots of luck.An essential book."

155,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Kahneman divides the way we think into two “systems”. These are not actual entities, but constructs that represent distinct modes of thought. System 1 is our intuitive sense covering ideas and feelings that just pop into our heads without effort. System 2 is our reasoning, rational sense that we use when we deliberately think things through. He offers many different scenarios that determine whether System 1 or System 2 is engaged. Realizing that this determination itself is often automatic can leave you feeling a little less in control. Kahneman shows us how many ways our thinking can go off track. Our immediate thoughts occur by association, resemblance to the familiar or because they represent our expectations. We jump to conclusions because it is the easiest thing to do. Our minds have an inherent laziness. We often stick with the first thought that comes to mind even though the situation calls for engaging System 2. If a question is just too hard for System 1, System 1 will make it simpler so we can forgo the mental work of engaging System 2.`Even when System 2 does engage, System 1 can subvert it without us being aware. Priming is the effect of being influenced by prior unrelated information. For example, Kahneman points to experiments that show just hearing something about money makes our subsequent behavior more self-centered. Anchoring refers to hearing or seeing a fact that sets a beginning point for evaluation of a subsequent problem. Just putting a number in the mind can make it a starting point for thinking about anything that comes next. Setting targets unrealistically high or low is used by negotiators to make their real goals seem more reasonable. Representativeness is about using stereotypes or imputing one quality from another similar to the halo effect. The halo effect occurs when current opinions often formed by System 1 shape subsequent judgements even if they are about something completely unrelated. For example if you find someone personable you are more likely to think they are also generous. Availability refers to anything that we hear repeatedly, which will be quickly recalled and used by System 1. And of course any judgement, snap or not, is subject to our emotions and mood. Preceding unrelated events may change the decisions we make. While System 1 operates at the WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) level ignoring information not immediately at hand, it can add things that are not there. It imputes motive and intent. It postulates connections between events. When System 1 is challenged by limited information it fills in the blanks. This may be very useful in some situations, but it also leads to unsupported assumptions and conspiracy theories.Most people tend to overconfidence in their judgement. We think we know more than we do. We underestimate randomness and put too much faith in patterns that are often temporary or simply imagined. We ignore baselines of activity and are overly influenced by recent events even though reversion to the mean is typically a better predictor of future outcomes. Intuition can be helpful but only when used by experts in fields where statistically significant correlations exist. Kahneman challenges conventional economic theory that assumes people are rational when they buy or sell. He identifies many influences that make economic decisions subjective. Key is loss aversion vs. gain. Losses are more psychologically painful and thus fear of them overweight decisions to avoid them. Context is very important. The significance of the amount to your personal situation matters. Just owning something increases its value to the owner. Framing is important. The language describing a transaction will invoke a System 1 response. Preceding transactions alter perception of the value of subsequent ones. Kahneman gives many more examples and decimates the notion of the rational consumer.Another fascinating concept concerns how we view our lives. Are we the experienced self or the remembered self? The experienced self consists of our feelings as we lived them, the other as they are remembered. The two are different. A twenty year marriage that was happy for 19 out of twenty years is very positive for the experienced self, but if the marriage ended in a bitter divorce it might all be remembered very negatively. A more mundane example is choosing a vacation. Do you choose a familiar place you know you like or a more stressful one that will create memories? The way we remember our lives does not match the way we lived them.Clearly this is a book to shake up your sense of self, and if you are like me you will enjoy the challenge. It also helps us to understand others and our relationships, although Kahneman doesn’t specifically target that aspect. I couldn’t keep from thinking of how System 1 and System 2 applied to people’s thinking in this year’s presidential election. Kahneman’s presentation is clear even for something as tricky as Bayesian analysis. My notes above cover only a small sample of the ideas in the book. I think most readers will find something to appreciate. Highly recommended. "
156,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,2,"Daniel Kahneman is a psychology professor at Princeton University who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on decision making. His book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is a journey through his theories with a primary focus on the business world and its failure to adequately apply statistical information to its predictive practices. What you should know, you ambitious soul, prior to picking up this work, is that the man is going to harsh your buzz and take great evil joy in doing it.Professor Kahneman suggests there are two systems in operation when we think. System One is quick, intuition-based and emotional. System Two is more deliberately analytical. Most decisions are made by System One because, according to Kahneman, System Two is a lazy goose and prefers not to exert the effort. That laziness is the reason we put our (misguided) faith in instinct, skill, confidence, expertise, personal experience and our own judgment when, really, we should confine ourselves to consulting the relevant available statistics. Just look at the facts, Jack. Stop indulging in the fantasy that you properly understand the past or can in any way predict the future. Forget what you think you know. You don't. You can't. And Kahneman, through chapters and chapters of interactive exercise and discourse, goes a long way toward proving this.Lots of people who know far more than I do about behavioral economics like this book and are five-star impressed by the material. Alas, I'm a visceral kid, so my considerations here are going to be a little off the statistical beaten path. For instance, Kahneman relays a story about a speaking engagement he once had with a group of investment advisers. Given a spreadsheet conveying the choices made by twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers over the course of eight consecutive years, the professor performs his calculations and proves to the top executives that financial expertise played no part in the outcome of those investments. Predictive acumen was absent. To quote: ""The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill."" Kahneman continues:The next morning we reported the findings to the advisers, and their response was equally bland. Their own experience of exercising careful judgment on complex problems was far more compelling to them than an obscure statistical fact. When we were done, one of the executives I had dined with the previous evening drove me to the airport. He told me, with a trace of defensiveness, ""I have done very well for the firm and no one can take that away from me."" I smiled and said nothing. But I thought, ""Well, I took it away from you this morning. If your success was due mostly to chance, how much credit are you entitled to take from it?""Now this interests me, this trollish glee. It interests and informs me. It also calls to mind several recent studies done in the area of clinical depression. Results are beginning to emerge to suggest those who suffer from this dark and pernicious despair may actually have a better grip on reality than those who don't. The depressed may indeed be seeing the world more clearly than the rest, and this may be why they're depressed - which brings to light the possibly essential role of denial in our lives. What we are able to repress on a daily basis - the inevitability of death, loss, sickness, natural and unnatural disaster; the random and entirely arbitrary nature of the universe; the cruelty of man; the unfairness of society, the powerlessness of the individual to effect measurable change - may indeed preserve our psychic well-being. Ignorance may not merely be bliss, it may be what's keeping us sane.Which is not to say, of course, that we shouldn't keep exploring and investigating and uncovering new truths. And it's not to say we should ignore the progress being made in all fields of endeavor. What draws my attention here is Kahneman's System One conveyance of his information - which seems pat, hubristic and ill-considered to me. He may have come up with certain statistical realities that illuminate the folly of our confidence in our own decision-making capacities. He may be correct in characterizing our faith in ourselves as ""delusional optimism."" But he doesn't go the extra mile of engaging the System Two segment of his brain to analyze the function such ""blind"" self-assurance may serve in regard to psychic health - a knowledge which sets up the much more intriguing question of whether it's more important to be right in the world, or right with it.Hey, we're all human. And, as it turns out, Kahneman's more human than most. But seriously, Professor, seriously...I could have done without that very high horse."
157,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow is an extremely well researched book - in fact painstakingly so. The book starts with a basic premise: we think fast at times based on intuition, and slow where more analysis is required. After discussing the concept in fair detail, the book goes on to list with excellent examples thinking biases especially with fast thinking. The examples are a mix of basic math, every day experiences, economic theory and others. There are also towards the end examples of satisfaction with life. This is a book which needs to be read slowly though and is a very serious read - it is very detailed in it's treatment."
158,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12520565-richard,2,"Kahneman is a brilliant thinker who's small experiments cracked the foundations of neo-classical/rational choice theory. His collections like Choices, Values and Frames are terrific reading, full of extraordinarily disorienting observations of actual human behavior. That said, this book was a bit of a disappointment. In this book, Kahneman weaves together a series of ideas based on his experiments and the experiments of like-minded researchers, and the effect is underwhelming. Gone is the careful exploration of small twists in human behavior, replaced with broad, rolling declarations that are only weakly supported by the data. For most of the experiments he cites, he fails to talk about the power of the findings (were participants 40% more likely to do something when framed a certain way? Or 4% more likely? Or 400%?). Sure, this is a book for a wider audience than his journal articles or academic collections, but I found that the dumbing down went too far. Too bad. The basic research that made Kahneman a star is fabulous. Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice is a great example - a review of experiments involving no more than some college students and coffee mugs, with counterintuitive findings about loss and market prices. Kahneman is at his best when he lets the reader figure out the implications of his stunning findings.Also, his dual process theory of thought - System 1 and System 2 - seems the less powerful of two competing views of human reason. A skeptic might ask what evidence is there that System 2 exists at all. System 2 certainly seems to be no less vulnerable to confirmation bias than System 1. The Mercier and Sperber formulation on the function of human reason just fits better with evolutionary models. Of course, that's probably just my confirmation bias kicking in."
159,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,3,"This is a comment on a specific element of the book, and not a review of the whole work. If there is something I truly HATE is the self-importance of “behavioral experiments” or “psychological tests” applied to the behavior of groups of people. You know, for example when a test group is asked to press a button under certain conditions, or state their feelings while watching some images, etc. I don’t have any doubts: I just think they are bullshit, pure and simple. And psychology is NOT a science. I wouldn’t have gone to the lengths of researching this further, but on page 57 the authors come up with the following ridiculous display of hubris :  “The results of these experiments are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THESE STUDIES ARE TRUE.” Haha! Prompted by this rather odd, childish statement, I decided to do a little research of my own, and .... it turns out that only 2 years ago a thorough study (now become very famous in the field) proved that:1) the specific experiment quoted in this book called “ego depletion” is complete bunk. 2) unsurprisingly, the VAST MAJORITY of these experiments have a very serious “reproducibility problem”. Hence, they cannot be considered “science”, or anything remotely leading us to “undeniably true conclusions”. The principles underlying the experiments are true enough, but not because they are proved by the experiments. It’s because they are “elegantly presented common sense”. Here is an article about the study. Enjoy. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_..."
160,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4628362-harry-lane,4,"This is a hard book. Not because the author is hard to read; on the contrary, he is clear, lucid and compelling. He uses a multitude of examples and cases to illustrate the points he makes. The difficulty is rather in us, the readers. Kahneman's thesis, abundantly supported, is that all of us operate on two levels. Anyone who is at all familiar with psychology and research into the brain knows about our ""lizard brain."" Kahneman shows how this part of our makeup operates at a level far beyond the fight or flight response, affecting our everyday lives in ways that we are totally unaware of. More than that, it affects our reasoning processes in ways that I never imagined. And though one can peruse the text easily enough, it is very, very difficult to make the application to one's own thought processes. Kahneman makes it plain that we could all benefit from a greater degree of self-awareness and disciplined thinking that takes into account these unconscious influences, but actually applying that is hard. That said, his book explains a lot about how easily we are manipulated, and why we so often draw the wrong conclusions from our experience. He also accounts for ""experts"" who are so often wrong and why the future is so unpredictable."
161,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Do you remember the feeling when your teacher asked you to read some pages from your textbook at home? You might have started off reading very carefully to get the point of every sentence, but as your reading progressed you got more and more bored, and finally you were flying your eyes over the last pages.That was the case with this book - we had to read it for our psychology class. Our teacher said it is a fascinating book and some other people I know had kind words to say about it as well; thus, I had high hopes for the book.I found the book tremendously tedious. There is too much text for all the points the author makes. Most of the time, I didn't even delve into the problem questions, which used way too much mathematical intuition.Now I understand why teachers don't want us to use 'you' form in essays. I couldn't stand his use of 'you' forms as if he thought he could read our minds. Most of the things he talked about were obvious anyway."

Hey, at least I was reading Kahneman before he won that Nobel Prize, before he got really popular. But I have to admit I never actually finished his Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases — it was due back at the library when I was only halfway through. That is a slow, engrossing grind of an academic tome, though.All the reviews have been glowing. Kahneman is golden, of course — he's ascended into the pantheon of the intelligentsia's demigods. The first one I read was from The Economist, then there was the one from the New York Times, and then I caught the one in The Wilson Quarterly, but what finally made really this the zeitgeist was when I came across a review in the fluffy “Paper” magazine (I was sitting in a coffeeshop waiting for some friends to finish a boardgame and picked up a free copy. More pop culture snuck into my brain in that twenty minutes than I permitted during the balance of 2011.)May 8th 2012 Update: The Economist chimes in with an aside: Foreign languages and thinking: Oprima dos for better cognition, in which they report on evidence that some of our cognitive flaws don't seem to interfere when we ponder the decision in a non-native language."

Thinking Fast and Slow
. It's so chock full of fantastic ideas, insights, and information that I'm afraid even trying to comment on it will make me look like a fool.Let me just say, then, that Thinking Fast and Slow is absolutely fascinating, a book worth reading and rereading, especially if you're of the self-improvement, self-examining type. Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner for his work in Behavioral Economics has a fascinating mind, and I felt like I had a front-row seat to one of the most incredible lectures about decision making, heuristics, and judgment that had ever been given.And here's where I start to worry about sounding like a fool: this just isn't my field of expertise. Sure, I love learning and I consider myself to be, in many respects, an autodidact. But Thinking Fast and Slow is, if I'm not mistaken, a summary of all of Kahneman's work from the last fifty years (or more?). It's gobstoppingly dense with studies Kahneman and his fellow researchers have devised to examine who people think, and I quell the thought of trying to comment on it.But I will gladly comment about it. Thinking Fast and Slow has been, over the weeks that I've been reading it, easily the book I've recommended most, and I admit having to suppress some excitement when someone tells me that they've ordered the book from Amazon. Even if you don't like economics, or maybe especially if you don't like economics, Kahneman's research is accessible to anyone with even a modicum of interest in society, decision-making, or how we think and exercise judgment. Rather than describe the world in terms of complex equations and graphs--though there are certainly a lot of graphs--Kahneman seems to be constantly devising thought experiments to understand how and why people act in certain situations. What a life it must be to be Kahneman, self-tasked with identifying the 'how' and 'why' of any particular decision, whether it is discerning who the best candidates are for officer training from among a cadre of soldiers during field exercises, or figuring out how to redesign the food pyramid to be a food pie, there seems to be no end of topics or situations where behavioral economics can be applied with some revelatory success.One part of especial interest to me was the section, near the end, when Kahneman begins to describe memory, pain, and suffering. If I understand right, Kahneman makes the point that research shows that it isn't the measurement of pleasure, happiness, or well-being over the duration of an event--such as a surgery, marriage, or vacation--that matters so much as how the event ends that we remember. Even if the event was, for the most part, a wonderful or positive experience we still remember the event based on how it ends. Shakespeare might put this as ""All's well that ends well."" For me, it's a paradigm-shifting insight about the importance not only of getting things right but also ending things right. How we remember things is, essentially, flawed, and what we are left with in memory often conflicts with what the experience was as a whole.Anyway, 
Thinking Fast and Slow 
is a great book. Prospect theory, framing, reference points, loss versus gain, and more are all raised and addressed and explored, and I am sure I will return to it again soon. I think I probably read it far too quickly, too eager to absorb concepts, and I feel there's more here to understand and examine."
164,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,2,"Have started skipping pages and chapters, seeking the really intriguing insights, which seem, most often, to be research other than that of Dr. Kahneman. Dr. Kahneman can devote most of a chapter to how he saved standardized tests for the Israeli military in the 1960´s. I think modesty is a big problem for him.Also, while it´s hard to imagine an academic community once utterly in thrall of perfect rationality, game theory, etc., the fact that mankind is not rational by rigid standards of logic now feels like a truism, and listing traps in statistical judgment that students fall into doesn´t make working rationality any more or less true. I sense that Dr. Kahneman also knows this.Like a book about the human brain I was picking through at roughly the same time, this is really a series of short papers written over quite a long time. It's likely that they contradict each other and somehow convey the illusion of complexity in the process.Is this the place to talk about problems with statistics as a science? Because Dr. Kahneman loves statistics, and wherever people fail at statitistics, Dr. Kahneman considers them irrational. This is self-serving, because he takes pains to point out that writers of statistics textbooks make basic statistical errors. He himself says he forgets to use large enough samples in studies sometimes.I attended a university which dedicated entire courses to the soft science of statistical failure, and then required I take those courses. One absolutely soporific professor Dr. Kahneman praises a great deal stood in front of my class and ""proved"" that statistically there is no reason to vote. Another ""proved"" that attacking Iraq was George Bush's only option in the Gulf War.Dr. Kahneman likes to say that a few simple measures are better than expert opinion. This is self-serving again, because results are measured by the same simple metrics. So, for example, experts are asked to predict the likelihood of a very limited number of distinctly defined options, multiple choice style. Or, in an example such as that of predicting the market for wine, the same growing conditions which are used to grade the quality of wine are used to predict its market value in the growing season. What a shock.This review is in danger of becoming as diffuse and confusing as the book. As another review points out, the book is fast and loose with statistics itself and essentially plays all sides of the field at once. I did browse some of the academic papers in the appendix and they weren't remarkable more consistent. It would be interesting to see the peer review process for those papers.Without having experienced the stifling milieu of absolute rationality in social sciences, I imagine we should be grateful for the comparative freedom Dr. Kahneman gave some students in the 50s. Still, per my update, the concluding pages of the book nearly sound like fascism. If statistics is the magical order of the universe, only to be discovered and worshipped by the select elite, well, the Dr. tells us that governments and companies, which are magically immune from (statistical) failures should be doing all of our thinking for us."
165,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"I've long wondered about the ""rational man"" of economic theory and have wondered if there was some kind of drug I could take that would enable me to be that person. And what did it mean that I--fully aware of my emotion-based spending (or, more likely, not spending) decisions--seemed, as a Prius owner, to be much more rational than the majority of American car buyers with their acceptance of insanely low mpg's?Having read this book, I now believe that the rational man of economic theory needs to be read out of the human race. (S)he has no more validity than the forecasting models that failed to predict the crash of 2008. For all practical purposes, as this book shows, we make judgments with our emotions *first*--and don't call on rationality unless we have to. Perhaps this is why Kahneman calls it System 1 (our ""just the facts ma'am"" side is System 2). Real thinking is hard work, and we are all slackers. We indulge in halo effects, we want to make correlations causative, we're easily influenced by extraneous sensory factors--the list of reason-dodging practices is an extensive one for which this book serves as a catalog.I spend a lot of time in board meetings as a result of my job. Even though the meetings aren't as dysfunctional as the ones in Dilbert, nonetheless I'm often disturbed by the pronounced unevenness of influence: those who express their opinions most often are the most influential; others keep their opinions to themselves until the final vote and then go along. I was delighted, then, when I saw this sentence: ""The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them."" Kahneman suggests a simple solution, which is simply to have everyone write down, before a meeting, a ""very brief summary of their position.""I might not be able to get this rule adopted. But if others fail to see its obvious wisdom, you can bet they will all be Hummer drivers."

In 2011 he published the best-seller, ""Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow"", a summary of his lifetimes work.DK has proved that our thinking patterns aren't half as smart as we might like to think they are. Our emotions like to think fast; in other words, jump to conclusions based on few facts and little analysis, leading to a belief that may well be largely irrational. Our intellect likes to think slowly, sifting facts, weighing judgements, possibly deciding the evidence is insufficient to reach any conclusion."
171,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"I don’t know how this book tastes like, it felt like a long night of cheese and wine maybe; sober. I couldn’t write a review easily, it took me a while to read, to ponder and now to write.Why this book? I am fascinated by decision making science (it was the subject of my Master’s thesis) and I am always looking for behavioral economics books such as Ariely’s and Taleb’s. Truth is, I don’t think I’ve read a better book about decision making; it is simply a psychological masterpiece. Kahneman is brilliant. The author (who is a Nobel Prize winner), in this book, attempts to deliver very complex scientific and detailed ideas about the human mind in a simplified way. The main idea of the book is that the human brain runs over 2 systems. System 1 “the automatic” is the intuitive and fast whereas system 2 is the slow thinker. These 2 systems are supposed to assist us with living this life , however they might cause us some problems because sometimes we need system 2 to do the work and system 1 is the one taking a decision. Here is an example, what is 2+2? Now what is 17x24? Well the answer to the first question is executed by system 1 whereas the second is by system 2.“System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgements you make.”When the answer is easy, we rarely double check with system 2. Here is a mind puzzling example he gives: (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.How much does the ball cost? _____ cents System 1 would immediately say 0.1, whereas the true answer is 0.05 (Do it on a paper). As a result, the quick fast system 1 might take shortcuts that are wrong while making a decision. There are several examples and at each I was amazed. Kahneman repeatedly labels system 2 as “lazy”: “We don’t want to think rigorously about something” that’s why most of the decisions are rather chosen easily and based on hunch or impression.The book is long 500 pages so I will just pinpoint a few ideas worth sharing: -	Avaliability Heuristic: We tend to make our choices based on the data available to us. People tend to highlight importance on easily retrieved data from memory. Kahneman indicates that most readilty available data is from memory. -	Priming: priming is also about what information we have before making a decision. For example, if you recently heard the word EAT, you are more likely to solve the word fragment SO_P by SOUP. But if you heard the word WASH, you’re most likely going to say SOAP. Priming occurs in system 1. -	Cognitive Ease: it is a cause and consequence of a pleasant feeling. A happy mood loosens the control of system2 over performance, when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. -	The halo effect: our tendency to judge a person or thing as good or bad even on things we haven’t obsereved. -	WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is.What I loved about the book is that it is more evidence of the simplicity of our brains (or stupidity) and how easily manipulated and fragile they are. We are far less rational than we think we are. Kahneman shows us all that through examples of simple everyday decisions. The book definietley doesn’t flow and it took me about 6 months to finish, sipping it and digesting it slowly. Don’t get me wrong, the style is simple but the content is heavy that you really would feel the need to put it down and ponder on the thought. The book changes your perception immediately. It made me question my previously made decisions, my feelings, my knowledge and definitely made me think more when I have system 1 kicking in for easily reachable answers. I recommend this book as a must read, but in case 500 pages is too much for you, read the chapters of “Overconfidence”, “Choices” and “Two Selves”. "

This book treats with a fair amount of academic rigor the subjects that ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell addresses with anecdotes. This book covers research that Kahneman conducted over his career, including research which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. This book will destroy much of your confidence in your own cognitive functioning and decision-making processes, then give you the tools you need to step back and rebuild those processes in a more rational way. This takes deliberate effort, as you will see in this book if you are not already familiar with the various cognitive biases and heuristics our minds employ to interpret the vast stream of incoming data.Kahneman begins by describing two systems of cognitive function - System 1, which operates quickly, emotionally, and subconsciously, and System 2, which operates slowly, consciously, and logically. The rest of the book is written within the framework of these two systems.Next, Kahneman describes a series of cognitive biases and heuristics that are responsible for our frequent struggles to think rationally and logically. Many of these involve our minds' failures to accurately apply statistical thinking to decision-making, and they account for many of our ""snap judgments"" which turn out to be baseless and false. We are afflicted by MANY cognitive biases, and this book is not exhaustive, but it does a great job of describing and discussing the several that it presents. If you are interested in a quick, easy overview of a broader range of these cognitive biases, check out You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney. This book is by no means academically rigorous as Kahneman's book is, but provides a much broader overview of these errors in our thought processes.Kahneman goes on to discuss Prospect Theory (for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics) in the context of these two systems. He delves a bit into behavioral economics and explains how and why humans differ in their behavior from the perfectly rational ""Econ"" that is the subject of study in the field of Economics. He also discusses how to avoid some of the shortcomings of our fast, subconscious thought processes in our day-to-day lives.Finally, Kahneman takes the two-system model and expands it into a ""two-self"" model with an ""experiential self"" and a ""remembered self."" He discusses these two selves in the context of multiple experiments he conducted to try to study happiness and comes to a rather astonishing conclusion about the impacts of duration and intensity of unpleasant events on perceived unpleasantness. The bottom line: we all (ostensibly) have brains, and we all struggle (to vastly varying degrees) on a day to day basis to make good decisions, to think logically and rationally, and to maximize our own happiness. If you want to get better at doing these things, read this book."

Well, I decided to think slow and read this treacherous tedious demon of a book and there was nothing in this book I wouldn't have gotten from reading the first few chapters.The only circumstances I would recommend this book is if I was starting a book club and I wanted the book club to fail. I have PTSD from this book that makes me hesitant to read any sort of psychology/behavior book."

175,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37980042-andy,5,"Great read. I enjoyed it just as much as I had enjoyed Rolf Dobelli's The Art of Thinking Clearly which I reference often when it comes to fallacies. Kahneman's metaphorical division of the mental life into two systems, fast and slow, makes the book quite interesting no matter how much one has read about the brain, mind, cognition and emotions. The goa, as Kahneman puts it, is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. Memory, he writes is and attribute of System 1, while deliberate checking and search are characteristics of System 2. Hence: ""Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.""My favorite quote from the book, perhaps because it is relevant to the current global, socio-political issues is this: ""A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."""
176,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577651-said-almaskery,4,The only reason I didn't give the book a 5 star is its length. The book is excellent in all aspects and tries to explain our biases and natural tendancies towards specific acts. Unfortunately that such books might not be very useful unless you read it in certain context and try to apply some of its main observations of the humans thinking patterns. I was initially introduced to the book in a negotiations skills course in London business School. This was my context.

178,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,5,"This is quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read. Not because the author attempts to make it that way, but just because of the implications. I shelved in under horror somewhat in jest, but I really do think that the book is Lovecraftian--not in the tentacles and unpronounceable names sense, but in the cosmic horror and nihilism sense:The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of CthulhuThat ""inability to correlate its contents"" is really what Thinking, Fast and Slow is about.Let me explain. The main thesis of the book is that decision making and evaluation of the world can primarily be sorted into two broad processes in the mind, which Kahneman calls ""System 1"" and ""System 2."" System 1 is intuitive, uses heuristics to evaluate information, is effortless, only deals with current information (WYSIATI, or ""What You See Is All There Is""), constructs causal narratives, and fast. System 2 is contemplative, judges based on logic, requires effort to engage, separates events properly, and is slow. Hence the book's title.Note that these terms don't refer to any single identifiable brain structure or thought process. They're simply ways of categorizing how the brain works.After a brief explanation of these systems, the rest of the book is a gigantic litany of all the ways in which humans are, essentially, buffeted by subconscious processes over which they have no control. And I use that phrase deliberately, because there are multiple examples of psychologists, including Kahneman himself, falling victim to the cognitive disortions depicted therein, even when they know about them and even directly after having exactly what they did wrong explained to them.The main reason for that is that thinking is hard. Most of the time, System 1 is good enough, especially for our savannah-dwelling hominid ancestors, and System 2 requires much more energy than relying on System 1, so we're reluctant to engage in it unless absolutely necessary and take basically every opportunity to switch back to System 1.So, here are some examples:The Halo Effect: How one's judgement of a person's actions is influenced by their overall character. If you like your boss, you're likely to interpret their sticking to a plan in the face of adversity as being even-tempered, cautious, persistent, and thoughtful. If you don't like them, you're likely to view the exact same actions as rigid, stubborn, and tyrannical. Another example is how more attractive people tend to be thought of as kinder or more intelligent than less attractive people even in the absence of evidence.Priming: Priming is changing estimates or judgements based on information that may not have anything to do with the judgement. The major example in the book is a wheel of fortune rigged to stop at either 10 or 65, and after spinning it, participants would be asked how many African countries are members of the U.N. The average answer for people who got a 10 was 25, and the average for people who got a 65 was 45. More disturbingly, judges with an average of fifteen years' experience rolled weighted dice designed to get either 3 or 9 before evaluating cases to determine sentencing. If the dice got 3, the average sentence was 5 months. If it was 9, it was 8 months.Endowment Effect: Owning something is better than not owning it, and getting it is better than giving it away. One example given is a oenophile who refuses to buy wine at more than $30 and refuses to sell it at more than $100. According to economic theory, that makes no sense. Well, it does--once bought, it has additional value since now it's owned, and owning something is more powerful than not owning it. Though it is pointed out that this doesn't tend to apply to cash or to retailers and their stock, since their possessors view them only as means to an end and not owned goods in and of themselves.Hindsight Bias: This is the tendency to see events that have already happened as being inevitable, even if they were unpredictable beforehand, and more generally as a tendency to edit memories in response to newly-provided information. This often shows up in accidents, where people suffer blame far out of proportion to the probability of the accident, and is especially damaging in trials, where juries will tend to assume that the probabilities of events are higher than they actually were. That also leads decision-makers to spend a large amount of resources on materials and policies to deflect blame, even if it makes things objectively worse (zero-tolerance policies at schools, for example)Regression to the Mean: Great successes tend to be followed by disappointing performance and dismal failure tends to be followed by improvement simply because over time, there are more incidents closer to the average than not. This can cause undue suffering, as in the example given of Israeli pilots. The instructor mentions the criticism is better than praise, because pilots tend to improve after they're criticized and get worse after they're praised. However, this isn't causal, it's just regression to the mean, and considering other research on praise vs. criticism, it's actively detrimental.Risk Aversion: People rate losses as worse than gains, and evaluate chances based not on their probability, but as weighted by whether it's a gain or loss. Furthermore, they tend to prefer certainty on gains, but will seek out risk over certainty for losses. As an example, consider two offers: in one, you can take $250 for sure or have a 30% chance to get $1000 and a 70% chance to get nothing, and in the other you can lose $700 for sure or have a 75% chance to lose $750 and a 25% chance to lose nothing. Most people will take the $250 on the first example and risk the gamble in the second, even though a strict accounting of probability would indicate it should be the other way around.Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect: Experiences are not evaluated in memory objectively. Instead, only two things tend to be considered--the highest (or lowest) single point, and the condition at the end. How long the experience lasted doesn't matter at all. In one example, an experimenter mentioned a certain women who had died of cancer at age 30 or age 60 after having lived a happy life. People were asked to evaluate her life, and the 30-year and 60-year groups generally rated it the same quality even though one was twice as long. However, when she lived 35 years or 65 years, and the last 5 years were not as happy as the preceding years, her quality of life was rated lower than the 30- or 60-year versions even though the total time was longer. These biases are also why people in new relationships after an acrimonious breakup tend to assume their new relationship is orders of magnitude better than their previous one, even if they had many happy years together before its end, simply because it ended badly.Cognitive Energy: Engaging System 2 takes effort, literally, and we try to avoid it when we don't want to. Furthermore, we're worse at it when depleted of energy. In one highly depressing example, a group of judges evaluating parole cases were studied, and it was found that the probability of them granting parole was directly proportional to how long it had been since they last ate. When they started for the day, the rate was 65% of cases granted parole, but right before lunch it was almost 0. That means that how hungry the judge was has a higher influence on parole applications than the merits of the case!WYSIATI: System 1 doesn't take any information into account other than what is directly in front of it, even if using System 2 makes it obvious that that information is highly relevant. One example is dolphins vs. orphans. The experimenter asked a group of people how much money they would donate to charity in two separate cases--saving dolphins and saving orphans. If the examples were given singly, then the average amount given to dolphins was almost three times the amount given to orphans. If they were given together, though, then the amount given to orphans beat the amount given to dolphins because now there was a new piece of information--orphans are human, dolphins are not--that previously was ignored because even though it was highly relevant, it wasn't part of the problem presented.Feminist Bank Teller: I don't remember the formal name for this one either, but it's an error of categorization. People were presented with a description of a person, including that she was outspoken, active in women's rights organizations, brash, etc., and then asked what careers she was likely to join. ""Feminist bank teller"" was weighted higher than ""bank teller"" both on lists where they appeared singly and when they appeared together, even though all feminist bank tellers are also bank tellers and therefore bank teller must be higher probability. A similar problem can be seen with coin flips. Most people will rate THHHTH as a more likely sequence than THHH, even though the first sequence is simply the second one with extra tosses added and therefore can only be less likely.There are literally dozens of other examples I haven't mentioned, because the review simply doesn't have enough space and anyway, there's already a book (and reams of psychology research) about it. And you should read it. Everyone should read it. Everyone should know about what is going on in their mind without their knowledge.Though one warning: Thinking, Fast and Slow is extremely dense. As another review mentions, it's not always clear whether he's writing this book for psychologists or a lay audience, and some parts may require several read-throughs to figure out what Kahneman is saying and the implications thereof.Then again, maybe that's just because System 2 is lazy and dumping things onto System 1.It's not automatically as horrible as I make it out. Kahneman specifically emphasizes that our minds are set up this way because the vast majority of the time, it's good enough to function and survive. To me, though, this really is Lovecraftian--in Lovecraft's stories it was alien races and sleeping deities manipulating humanity without humanity's knowledge, and here it's the unconscious processes in our own mind. I value rationality very highly and do my best to try to be rational, but this book makes a very good case that rationality is literally impossible except in certain specific cases, and it can't be sustained since System 2 takes energy, and the more energy you use, the more likely System 2 is to give up and dump everything back on System 1 even if you know about all of these cognitive errors.So, you might find this book horribly depressing, like I did, or you may find it inspiring, like someone else I know, who said that knowing about all the natural errors in human cognition is the first step in developing a way to fix them. But either way, you should read it, because there's little that's more important to understand than the workings of your own mind."
179,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446434-hundeschlitten,2,"There are some interesting ideas here, but why do so many of these left-brain science types insist on writing their own books? Like a lot of generalized overviews written by some expert in his or her field, Daniel Kahneman's survey of the current ideas surrounding behavioral economics was a real chore to slog through at times. The book is broken into five sections and, at least to me, things really didn't start getting interesting until section three. In the first two sections, there are just too many experiments Kahneman felt the need to summarize, almost all demonstrating some way in which our decision making is less than entirely efficient. At times, I felt like I was plodding across the written equivalent of the Oregon Trail, with no end in sight. In Part Three, Kahneman begins to use these experiments to dismantle the concepts of the Chicago school of economics, which is based on the concept that we are all rational actors. But then Kahneman accepts the theory of ""highly efficient markets"" as a given, which makes no sense if their participants aren't being rational. So even here, Kahneman loses me. But at least he's being topical.Part Four features more experiments, most of which attempt to find ways in which you can trick otherwise intelligent people into making non-sensible decisions.Part Five is the most intellectually interesting part of the book, as Kahneman posits an experiencing self and a remembering self, and what this implies about how we make decisions. So unless you read very quickly, my advice is to begin at page 199, and feel free to skim some of the chapters (which are numerous but mercifully short) until you get to the final section on the two selves, which begins on page 377.

As I read it, page after page was covered in notes, 'yes' 'no' 'really?' 'but'....What Kahneman discusses in this book is something we've all known in a less rigorous way, perhaps - the intuitive and the analytical paths to decision making and action.Two SystemsPsychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the two modes of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2.System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.The labels of System 1 and System 2 are widely used in psychology, but I go further than most in this book, which you can read as a psychodrama with two characters.Surely you chess and bridge players are already sitting up and paying attention. We all know about that psychodrama. He continues:When we think if ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book. I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 general surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1. You will be invited to think of the two systems as agents with their individual abilities, limitations, and functions.Of course this hasn't been written with game players in mind, and you may, like me, find yourself disagreeing with some of the ideas here. For a start, System 1 is based on the infinite hard work of System 2. As far as playing games go, you aren't born with S1, it grows and improves because of S2. However, it is definitely food for thought and may help clarify aspects of how you are thinking and how you might address issues.Educational and sometimes astonishing when it comes to how bad we humans are at dealing with data.

181,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859963-suhrob,5,"In ""Thinking, fast and slow"" the Nobel laureate Danny Kahneman summarizes his life long work mostly done with his collegue (and Nobel corecipient) Amos Tversky in the field of cognitive psychology and decision making.There has been an outcrop of books on this topic in the recent years (Ariely and Lehrer being the bigger names) and there is a significant overlap with similar books. However, for the seriously interested I'd recommend to start here. This is the original reference, the user manual for your brain.The scope of the book is large but Kahneman tries to make the topics more accessible by anthropomorphising the two cognitive ""systems"" in interplay in human decision making (though giving them the non descript names ""1"" and ""2""). The chapters end with examples (""soundbites"") where the introduced concepts are used in real life settings. This attempt at accessibility is, in my opinion, undermined by the 400 page tome which might be too intimidating to some. But I can understand the tension between trying to be influential and trying to summarize a whole field and life long work.Apart from that, the book is very lean, you won't find any cutesy stories or participatory journalism. Just concept after concept and the relevant research. But don't let that discourage you - the book is well written and structured. I consider the lack of fluff a big plus.Kahneman is skeptical that even learning about all these cognitive biases can make a change on individual level, but hopes something can be done on institutional level. The whole thing is a bit saddening. We are really running on a to me still very impressive, but at the same time, very flawed system. The sheer scope how irrelevant factors influence our decision making even on highest levels is frightening.I am generally very optimistic about the future of humanity and would love to be around to see where it goes, but if we get there, if we are ever to make it, it will be only with a lots of luck.An essential book."

185,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Kahneman divides the way we think into two “systems”. These are not actual entities, but constructs that represent distinct modes of thought. System 1 is our intuitive sense covering ideas and feelings that just pop into our heads without effort. System 2 is our reasoning, rational sense that we use when we deliberately think things through. He offers many different scenarios that determine whether System 1 or System 2 is engaged. Realizing that this determination itself is often automatic can leave you feeling a little less in control. Kahneman shows us how many ways our thinking can go off track. Our immediate thoughts occur by association, resemblance to the familiar or because they represent our expectations. We jump to conclusions because it is the easiest thing to do. Our minds have an inherent laziness. We often stick with the first thought that comes to mind even though the situation calls for engaging System 2. If a question is just too hard for System 1, System 1 will make it simpler so we can forgo the mental work of engaging System 2.`Even when System 2 does engage, System 1 can subvert it without us being aware. Priming is the effect of being influenced by prior unrelated information. For example, Kahneman points to experiments that show just hearing something about money makes our subsequent behavior more self-centered. Anchoring refers to hearing or seeing a fact that sets a beginning point for evaluation of a subsequent problem. Just putting a number in the mind can make it a starting point for thinking about anything that comes next. Setting targets unrealistically high or low is used by negotiators to make their real goals seem more reasonable. Representativeness is about using stereotypes or imputing one quality from another similar to the halo effect. The halo effect occurs when current opinions often formed by System 1 shape subsequent judgements even if they are about something completely unrelated. For example if you find someone personable you are more likely to think they are also generous. Availability refers to anything that we hear repeatedly, which will be quickly recalled and used by System 1. And of course any judgement, snap or not, is subject to our emotions and mood. Preceding unrelated events may change the decisions we make. While System 1 operates at the WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) level ignoring information not immediately at hand, it can add things that are not there. It imputes motive and intent. It postulates connections between events. When System 1 is challenged by limited information it fills in the blanks. This may be very useful in some situations, but it also leads to unsupported assumptions and conspiracy theories.Most people tend to overconfidence in their judgement. We think we know more than we do. We underestimate randomness and put too much faith in patterns that are often temporary or simply imagined. We ignore baselines of activity and are overly influenced by recent events even though reversion to the mean is typically a better predictor of future outcomes. Intuition can be helpful but only when used by experts in fields where statistically significant correlations exist. Kahneman challenges conventional economic theory that assumes people are rational when they buy or sell. He identifies many influences that make economic decisions subjective. Key is loss aversion vs. gain. Losses are more psychologically painful and thus fear of them overweight decisions to avoid them. Context is very important. The significance of the amount to your personal situation matters. Just owning something increases its value to the owner. Framing is important. The language describing a transaction will invoke a System 1 response. Preceding transactions alter perception of the value of subsequent ones. Kahneman gives many more examples and decimates the notion of the rational consumer.Another fascinating concept concerns how we view our lives. Are we the experienced self or the remembered self? The experienced self consists of our feelings as we lived them, the other as they are remembered. The two are different. A twenty year marriage that was happy for 19 out of twenty years is very positive for the experienced self, but if the marriage ended in a bitter divorce it might all be remembered very negatively. A more mundane example is choosing a vacation. Do you choose a familiar place you know you like or a more stressful one that will create memories? The way we remember our lives does not match the way we lived them.Clearly this is a book to shake up your sense of self, and if you are like me you will enjoy the challenge. It also helps us to understand others and our relationships, although Kahneman doesn’t specifically target that aspect. I couldn’t keep from thinking of how System 1 and System 2 applied to people’s thinking in this year’s presidential election. Kahneman’s presentation is clear even for something as tricky as Bayesian analysis. My notes above cover only a small sample of the ideas in the book. I think most readers will find something to appreciate. Highly recommended. "
186,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,2,"Daniel Kahneman is a psychology professor at Princeton University who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on decision making. His book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is a journey through his theories with a primary focus on the business world and its failure to adequately apply statistical information to its predictive practices. What you should know, you ambitious soul, prior to picking up this work, is that the man is going to harsh your buzz and take great evil joy in doing it.Professor Kahneman suggests there are two systems in operation when we think. System One is quick, intuition-based and emotional. System Two is more deliberately analytical. Most decisions are made by System One because, according to Kahneman, System Two is a lazy goose and prefers not to exert the effort. That laziness is the reason we put our (misguided) faith in instinct, skill, confidence, expertise, personal experience and our own judgment when, really, we should confine ourselves to consulting the relevant available statistics. Just look at the facts, Jack. Stop indulging in the fantasy that you properly understand the past or can in any way predict the future. Forget what you think you know. You don't. You can't. And Kahneman, through chapters and chapters of interactive exercise and discourse, goes a long way toward proving this.Lots of people who know far more than I do about behavioral economics like this book and are five-star impressed by the material. Alas, I'm a visceral kid, so my considerations here are going to be a little off the statistical beaten path. For instance, Kahneman relays a story about a speaking engagement he once had with a group of investment advisers. Given a spreadsheet conveying the choices made by twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers over the course of eight consecutive years, the professor performs his calculations and proves to the top executives that financial expertise played no part in the outcome of those investments. Predictive acumen was absent. To quote: ""The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill."" Kahneman continues:The next morning we reported the findings to the advisers, and their response was equally bland. Their own experience of exercising careful judgment on complex problems was far more compelling to them than an obscure statistical fact. When we were done, one of the executives I had dined with the previous evening drove me to the airport. He told me, with a trace of defensiveness, ""I have done very well for the firm and no one can take that away from me."" I smiled and said nothing. But I thought, ""Well, I took it away from you this morning. If your success was due mostly to chance, how much credit are you entitled to take from it?""Now this interests me, this trollish glee. It interests and informs me. It also calls to mind several recent studies done in the area of clinical depression. Results are beginning to emerge to suggest those who suffer from this dark and pernicious despair may actually have a better grip on reality than those who don't. The depressed may indeed be seeing the world more clearly than the rest, and this may be why they're depressed - which brings to light the possibly essential role of denial in our lives. What we are able to repress on a daily basis - the inevitability of death, loss, sickness, natural and unnatural disaster; the random and entirely arbitrary nature of the universe; the cruelty of man; the unfairness of society, the powerlessness of the individual to effect measurable change - may indeed preserve our psychic well-being. Ignorance may not merely be bliss, it may be what's keeping us sane.Which is not to say, of course, that we shouldn't keep exploring and investigating and uncovering new truths. And it's not to say we should ignore the progress being made in all fields of endeavor. What draws my attention here is Kahneman's System One conveyance of his information - which seems pat, hubristic and ill-considered to me. He may have come up with certain statistical realities that illuminate the folly of our confidence in our own decision-making capacities. He may be correct in characterizing our faith in ourselves as ""delusional optimism."" But he doesn't go the extra mile of engaging the System Two segment of his brain to analyze the function such ""blind"" self-assurance may serve in regard to psychic health - a knowledge which sets up the much more intriguing question of whether it's more important to be right in the world, or right with it.Hey, we're all human. And, as it turns out, Kahneman's more human than most. But seriously, Professor, seriously...I could have done without that very high horse."

The book starts with a basic premise: we think fast at times based on intuition, and slow where more analysis is required. After discussing the concept in fair detail, the book goes on to list with excellent examples thinking biases especially with fast thinking. The examples are a mix of basic math, every day experiences, economic theory and others. There are also towards the end examples of satisfaction with life. This is a book which needs to be read slowly though and is a very serious read - it is very detailed in it's treatment."
188,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12520565-richard,2,"Kahneman is a brilliant thinker who's small experiments cracked the foundations of neo-classical/rational choice theory. His collections like Choices, Values and Frames are terrific reading, full of extraordinarily disorienting observations of actual human behavior. That said, this book was a bit of a disappointment. In this book, Kahneman weaves together a series of ideas based on his experiments and the experiments of like-minded researchers, and the effect is underwhelming. Gone is the careful exploration of small twists in human behavior, replaced with broad, rolling declarations that are only weakly supported by the data. For most of the experiments he cites, he fails to talk about the power of the findings (were participants 40% more likely to do something when framed a certain way? Or 4% more likely? Or 400%?). Sure, this is a book for a wider audience than his journal articles or academic collections, but I found that the dumbing down went too far. Too bad. The basic research that made Kahneman a star is fabulous. Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice is a great example - a review of experiments involving no more than some college students and coffee mugs, with counterintuitive findings about loss and market prices. Kahneman is at his best when he lets the reader figure out the implications of his stunning findings.Also, his dual process theory of thought - System 1 and System 2 - seems the less powerful of two competing views of human reason. A skeptic might ask what evidence is there that System 2 exists at all. System 2 certainly seems to be no less vulnerable to confirmation bias than System 1. The Mercier and Sperber formulation on the function of human reason just fits better with evolutionary models. Of course, that's probably just my confirmation bias kicking in."
189,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,3,"This is a comment on a specific element of the book, and not a review of the whole work. If there is something I truly HATE is the self-importance of “behavioral experiments” or “psychological tests” applied to the behavior of groups of people. You know, for example when a test group is asked to press a button under certain conditions, or state their feelings while watching some images, etc. I don’t have any doubts: I just think they are bullshit, pure and simple. And psychology is NOT a science. I wouldn’t have gone to the lengths of researching this further, but on page 57 the authors come up with the following ridiculous display of hubris :  “The results of these experiments are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THESE STUDIES ARE TRUE.” Haha! Prompted by this rather odd, childish statement, I decided to do a little research of my own, and .... it turns out that only 2 years ago a thorough study (now become very famous in the field) proved that:1) the specific experiment quoted in this book called “ego depletion” is complete bunk. 2) unsurprisingly, the VAST MAJORITY of these experiments have a very serious “reproducibility problem”. Hence, they cannot be considered “science”, or anything remotely leading us to “undeniably true conclusions”. The principles underlying the experiments are true enough, but not because they are proved by the experiments. It’s because they are “elegantly presented common sense”. Here is an article about the study. Enjoy. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_..."

He uses a multitude of examples and cases to illustrate the points he makes. The difficulty is rather in us, the readers. Kahneman's thesis, abundantly supported, is that all of us operate on two levels. Anyone who is at all familiar with psychology and research into the brain knows about our ""lizard brain."" Kahneman shows how this part of our makeup operates at a level far beyond the fight or flight response, affecting our everyday lives in ways that we are totally unaware of. More than that, it affects our reasoning processes in ways that I never imagined. And though one can peruse the text easily enough, it is very, very difficult to make the application to one's own thought processes. Kahneman makes it plain that we could all benefit from a greater degree of self-awareness and disciplined thinking that takes into account these unconscious influences, but actually applying that is hard. That said, his book explains a lot about how easily we are manipulated, and why we so often draw the wrong conclusions from our experience. He also accounts for ""experts"" who are so often wrong and why the future is so unpredictable."
191,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Do you remember the feeling when your teacher asked you to read some pages from your textbook at home? You might have started off reading very carefully to get the point of every sentence, but as your reading progressed you got more and more bored, and finally you were flying your eyes over the last pages.That was the case with this book - we had to read it for our psychology class. Our teacher said it is a fascinating book and some other people I know had kind words to say about it as well; thus, I had high hopes for the book.I found the book tremendously tedious. There is too much text for all the points the author makes. Most of the time, I didn't even delve into the problem questions, which used way too much mathematical intuition.Now I understand why teachers don't want us to use 'you' form in essays. I couldn't stand his use of 'you' forms as if he thought he could read our minds. Most of the things he talked about were obvious anyway."
192,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Okay, yeah, this has to go on the to-be-read shelf. And the over-stuffed cognition shelf. Hey, at least I was reading Kahneman before he won that Nobel Prize, before he got really popular. But I have to admit I never actually finished his Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases — it was due back at the library when I was only halfway through. That is a slow, engrossing grind of an academic tome, though.All the reviews have been glowing. Kahneman is golden, of course — he's ascended into the pantheon of the intelligentsia's demigods. The first one I read was from The Economist, then there was the one from the New York Times, and then I caught the one in The Wilson Quarterly, but what finally made really this the zeitgeist was when I came across a review in the fluffy “Paper” magazine (I was sitting in a coffeeshop waiting for some friends to finish a boardgame and picked up a free copy. More pop culture snuck into my brain in that twenty minutes than I permitted during the balance of 2011.)May 8th 2012 Update: The Economist chimes in with an aside: Foreign languages and thinking: Oprima dos for better cognition, in which they report on evidence that some of our cognitive flaws don't seem to interfere when we ponder the decision in a non-native language."

Thinking Fast and Slow
. It's so chock full of fantastic ideas, insights, and information that I'm afraid even trying to comment on it will make me look like a fool.Let me just say, then, that Thinking Fast and Slow is absolutely fascinating, a book worth reading and rereading, especially if you're of the self-improvement, self-examining type. Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner for his work in Behavioral Economics has a fascinating mind, and I felt like I had a front-row seat to one of the most incredible lectures about decision making, heuristics, and judgment that had ever been given.And here's where I start to worry about sounding like a fool: this just isn't my field of expertise. Sure, I love learning and I consider myself to be, in many respects, an autodidact. But Thinking Fast and Slow is, if I'm not mistaken, a summary of all of Kahneman's work from the last fifty years (or more?). It's gobstoppingly dense with studies Kahneman and his fellow researchers have devised to examine who people think, and I quell the thought of trying to comment on it.But I will gladly comment about it. Thinking Fast and Slow has been, over the weeks that I've been reading it, easily the book I've recommended most, and I admit having to suppress some excitement when someone tells me that they've ordered the book from Amazon. Even if you don't like economics, or maybe especially if you don't like economics, Kahneman's research is accessible to anyone with even a modicum of interest in society, decision-making, or how we think and exercise judgment. Rather than describe the world in terms of complex equations and graphs--though there are certainly a lot of graphs--Kahneman seems to be constantly devising thought experiments to understand how and why people act in certain situations. What a life it must be to be Kahneman, self-tasked with identifying the 'how' and 'why' of any particular decision, whether it is discerning who the best candidates are for officer training from among a cadre of soldiers during field exercises, or figuring out how to redesign the food pyramid to be a food pie, there seems to be no end of topics or situations where behavioral economics can be applied with some revelatory success.One part of especial interest to me was the section, near the end, when Kahneman begins to describe memory, pain, and suffering. If I understand right, Kahneman makes the point that research shows that it isn't the measurement of pleasure, happiness, or well-being over the duration of an event--such as a surgery, marriage, or vacation--that matters so much as how the event ends that we remember. Even if the event was, for the most part, a wonderful or positive experience we still remember the event based on how it ends. Shakespeare might put this as ""All's well that ends well."" For me, it's a paradigm-shifting insight about the importance not only of getting things right but also ending things right. How we remember things is, essentially, flawed, and what we are left with in memory often conflicts with what the experience was as a whole.Anyway, 
Thinking Fast and Slow 
is a great book. Prospect theory, framing, reference points, loss versus gain, and more are all raised and addressed and explored, and I am sure I will return to it again soon. I think I probably read it far too quickly, too eager to absorb concepts, and I feel there's more here to understand and examine."
194,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,2,"Have started skipping pages and chapters, seeking the really intriguing insights, which seem, most often, to be research other than that of Dr. Kahneman. Dr. Kahneman can devote most of a chapter to how he saved standardized tests for the Israeli military in the 1960´s. I think modesty is a big problem for him.Also, while it´s hard to imagine an academic community once utterly in thrall of perfect rationality, game theory, etc., the fact that mankind is not rational by rigid standards of logic now feels like a truism, and listing traps in statistical judgment that students fall into doesn´t make working rationality any more or less true. I sense that Dr. Kahneman also knows this.Like a book about the human brain I was picking through at roughly the same time, this is really a series of short papers written over quite a long time. It's likely that they contradict each other and somehow convey the illusion of complexity in the process.Is this the place to talk about problems with statistics as a science? Because Dr. Kahneman loves statistics, and wherever people fail at statitistics, Dr. Kahneman considers them irrational. This is self-serving, because he takes pains to point out that writers of statistics textbooks make basic statistical errors. He himself says he forgets to use large enough samples in studies sometimes.I attended a university which dedicated entire courses to the soft science of statistical failure, and then required I take those courses. One absolutely soporific professor Dr. Kahneman praises a great deal stood in front of my class and ""proved"" that statistically there is no reason to vote. Another ""proved"" that attacking Iraq was George Bush's only option in the Gulf War.Dr. Kahneman likes to say that a few simple measures are better than expert opinion. This is self-serving again, because results are measured by the same simple metrics. So, for example, experts are asked to predict the likelihood of a very limited number of distinctly defined options, multiple choice style. Or, in an example such as that of predicting the market for wine, the same growing conditions which are used to grade the quality of wine are used to predict its market value in the growing season. What a shock.This review is in danger of becoming as diffuse and confusing as the book. As another review points out, the book is fast and loose with statistics itself and essentially plays all sides of the field at once. I did browse some of the academic papers in the appendix and they weren't remarkable more consistent. It would be interesting to see the peer review process for those papers.Without having experienced the stifling milieu of absolute rationality in social sciences, I imagine we should be grateful for the comparative freedom Dr. Kahneman gave some students in the 50s. Still, per my update, the concluding pages of the book nearly sound like fascism. If statistics is the magical order of the universe, only to be discovered and worshipped by the select elite, well, the Dr. tells us that governments and companies, which are magically immune from (statistical) failures should be doing all of our thinking for us."
195,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"I've long wondered about the ""rational man"" of economic theory and have wondered if there was some kind of drug I could take that would enable me to be that person. And what did it mean that I--fully aware of my emotion-based spending (or, more likely, not spending) decisions--seemed, as a Prius owner, to be much more rational than the majority of American car buyers with their acceptance of insanely low mpg's?Having read this book, I now believe that the rational man of economic theory needs to be read out of the human race. (S)he has no more validity than the forecasting models that failed to predict the crash of 2008. For all practical purposes, as this book shows, we make judgments with our emotions *first*--and don't call on rationality unless we have to. Perhaps this is why Kahneman calls it System 1 (our ""just the facts ma'am"" side is System 2). Real thinking is hard work, and we are all slackers. We indulge in halo effects, we want to make correlations causative, we're easily influenced by extraneous sensory factors--the list of reason-dodging practices is an extensive one for which this book serves as a catalog.I spend a lot of time in board meetings as a result of my job. Even though the meetings aren't as dysfunctional as the ones in Dilbert, nonetheless I'm often disturbed by the pronounced unevenness of influence: those who express their opinions most often are the most influential; others keep their opinions to themselves until the final vote and then go along. I was delighted, then, when I saw this sentence: ""The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them."" Kahneman suggests a simple solution, which is simply to have everyone write down, before a meeting, a ""very brief summary of their position.""I might not be able to get this rule adopted. But if others fail to see its obvious wisdom, you can bet they will all be Hummer drivers."

In 2011 he published the best-seller, ""Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow"", a summary of his lifetimes work.DK has proved that our thinking patterns aren't half as smart as we might like to think they are. Our emotions like to think fast; in other words, jump to conclusions based on few facts and little analysis, leading to a belief that may well be largely irrational. Our intellect likes to think slowly, sifting facts, weighing judgements, possibly deciding the evidence is insufficient to reach any conclusion."
201,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"I don’t know how this book tastes like, it felt like a long night of cheese and wine maybe; sober. I couldn’t write a review easily, it took me a while to read, to ponder and now to write.Why this book? I am fascinated by decision making science (it was the subject of my Master’s thesis) and I am always looking for behavioral economics books such as Ariely’s and Taleb’s. Truth is, I don’t think I’ve read a better book about decision making; it is simply a psychological masterpiece. Kahneman is brilliant. The author (who is a Nobel Prize winner), in this book, attempts to deliver very complex scientific and detailed ideas about the human mind in a simplified way. The main idea of the book is that the human brain runs over 2 systems. System 1 “the automatic” is the intuitive and fast whereas system 2 is the slow thinker. These 2 systems are supposed to assist us with living this life , however they might cause us some problems because sometimes we need system 2 to do the work and system 1 is the one taking a decision. Here is an example, what is 2+2? Now what is 17x24? Well the answer to the first question is executed by system 1 whereas the second is by system 2.“System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgements you make.”When the answer is easy, we rarely double check with system 2. Here is a mind puzzling example he gives: (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.How much does the ball cost? _____ cents System 1 would immediately say 0.1, whereas the true answer is 0.05 (Do it on a paper). As a result, the quick fast system 1 might take shortcuts that are wrong while making a decision. There are several examples and at each I was amazed. Kahneman repeatedly labels system 2 as “lazy”: “We don’t want to think rigorously about something” that’s why most of the decisions are rather chosen easily and based on hunch or impression.The book is long 500 pages so I will just pinpoint a few ideas worth sharing: -	Avaliability Heuristic: We tend to make our choices based on the data available to us. People tend to highlight importance on easily retrieved data from memory. Kahneman indicates that most readilty available data is from memory. -	Priming: priming is also about what information we have before making a decision. For example, if you recently heard the word EAT, you are more likely to solve the word fragment SO_P by SOUP. But if you heard the word WASH, you’re most likely going to say SOAP. Priming occurs in system 1. -	Cognitive Ease: it is a cause and consequence of a pleasant feeling. A happy mood loosens the control of system2 over performance, when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. -	The halo effect: our tendency to judge a person or thing as good or bad even on things we haven’t obsereved. -	WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is.What I loved about the book is that it is more evidence of the simplicity of our brains (or stupidity) and how easily manipulated and fragile they are. We are far less rational than we think we are. Kahneman shows us all that through examples of simple everyday decisions. The book definietley doesn’t flow and it took me about 6 months to finish, sipping it and digesting it slowly. Don’t get me wrong, the style is simple but the content is heavy that you really would feel the need to put it down and ponder on the thought. The book changes your perception immediately. It made me question my previously made decisions, my feelings, my knowledge and definitely made me think more when I have system 1 kicking in for easily reachable answers. I recommend this book as a must read, but in case 500 pages is too much for you, read the chapters of “Overconfidence”, “Choices” and “Two Selves”. "
202,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,4,"If you are interested in learning more about how the brain works, which you should be, you need to read this book. This book treats with a fair amount of academic rigor the subjects that ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell addresses with anecdotes. This book covers research that Kahneman conducted over his career, including research which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. This book will destroy much of your confidence in your own cognitive functioning and decision-making processes, then give you the tools you need to step back and rebuild those processes in a more rational way. This takes deliberate effort, as you will see in this book if you are not already familiar with the various cognitive biases and heuristics our minds employ to interpret the vast stream of incoming data.Kahneman begins by describing two systems of cognitive function - System 1, which operates quickly, emotionally, and subconsciously, and System 2, which operates slowly, consciously, and logically. The rest of the book is written within the framework of these two systems.Next, Kahneman describes a series of cognitive biases and heuristics that are responsible for our frequent struggles to think rationally and logically. Many of these involve our minds' failures to accurately apply statistical thinking to decision-making, and they account for many of our ""snap judgments"" which turn out to be baseless and false. We are afflicted by MANY cognitive biases, and this book is not exhaustive, but it does a great job of describing and discussing the several that it presents. If you are interested in a quick, easy overview of a broader range of these cognitive biases, check out You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney. This book is by no means academically rigorous as Kahneman's book is, but provides a much broader overview of these errors in our thought processes.Kahneman goes on to discuss Prospect Theory (for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics) in the context of these two systems. He delves a bit into behavioral economics and explains how and why humans differ in their behavior from the perfectly rational ""Econ"" that is the subject of study in the field of Economics. He also discusses how to avoid some of the shortcomings of our fast, subconscious thought processes in our day-to-day lives.Finally, Kahneman takes the two-system model and expands it into a ""two-self"" model with an ""experiential self"" and a ""remembered self."" He discusses these two selves in the context of multiple experiments he conducted to try to study happiness and comes to a rather astonishing conclusion about the impacts of duration and intensity of unpleasant events on perceived unpleasantness. The bottom line: we all (ostensibly) have brains, and we all struggle (to vastly varying degrees) on a day to day basis to make good decisions, to think logically and rationally, and to maximize our own happiness. If you want to get better at doing these things, read this book."

I enjoyed it just as much as I had enjoyed Rolf Dobelli's The Art of Thinking Clearly which I reference often when it comes to fallacies. Kahneman's metaphorical division of the mental life into two systems, fast and slow, makes the book quite interesting no matter how much one has read about the brain, mind, cognition and emotions. The goa, as Kahneman puts it, is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. Memory, he writes is and attribute of System 1, while deliberate checking and search are characteristics of System 2. Hence: ""Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.""My favorite quote from the book, perhaps because it is relevant to the current global, socio-political issues is this: ""A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."""

208,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,5,"This is quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read. Not because the author attempts to make it that way, but just because of the implications. I shelved in under horror somewhat in jest, but I really do think that the book is Lovecraftian--not in the tentacles and unpronounceable names sense, but in the cosmic horror and nihilism sense:The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of CthulhuThat ""inability to correlate its contents"" is really what Thinking, Fast and Slow is about.Let me explain. The main thesis of the book is that decision making and evaluation of the world can primarily be sorted into two broad processes in the mind, which Kahneman calls ""System 1"" and ""System 2."" System 1 is intuitive, uses heuristics to evaluate information, is effortless, only deals with current information (WYSIATI, or ""What You See Is All There Is""), constructs causal narratives, and fast. System 2 is contemplative, judges based on logic, requires effort to engage, separates events properly, and is slow. Hence the book's title.Note that these terms don't refer to any single identifiable brain structure or thought process. They're simply ways of categorizing how the brain works.After a brief explanation of these systems, the rest of the book is a gigantic litany of all the ways in which humans are, essentially, buffeted by subconscious processes over which they have no control. And I use that phrase deliberately, because there are multiple examples of psychologists, including Kahneman himself, falling victim to the cognitive disortions depicted therein, even when they know about them and even directly after having exactly what they did wrong explained to them.The main reason for that is that thinking is hard. Most of the time, System 1 is good enough, especially for our savannah-dwelling hominid ancestors, and System 2 requires much more energy than relying on System 1, so we're reluctant to engage in it unless absolutely necessary and take basically every opportunity to switch back to System 1.So, here are some examples:The Halo Effect: How one's judgement of a person's actions is influenced by their overall character. If you like your boss, you're likely to interpret their sticking to a plan in the face of adversity as being even-tempered, cautious, persistent, and thoughtful. If you don't like them, you're likely to view the exact same actions as rigid, stubborn, and tyrannical. Another example is how more attractive people tend to be thought of as kinder or more intelligent than less attractive people even in the absence of evidence.Priming: Priming is changing estimates or judgements based on information that may not have anything to do with the judgement. The major example in the book is a wheel of fortune rigged to stop at either 10 or 65, and after spinning it, participants would be asked how many African countries are members of the U.N. The average answer for people who got a 10 was 25, and the average for people who got a 65 was 45. More disturbingly, judges with an average of fifteen years' experience rolled weighted dice designed to get either 3 or 9 before evaluating cases to determine sentencing. If the dice got 3, the average sentence was 5 months. If it was 9, it was 8 months.Endowment Effect: Owning something is better than not owning it, and getting it is better than giving it away. One example given is a oenophile who refuses to buy wine at more than $30 and refuses to sell it at more than $100. According to economic theory, that makes no sense. Well, it does--once bought, it has additional value since now it's owned, and owning something is more powerful than not owning it. Though it is pointed out that this doesn't tend to apply to cash or to retailers and their stock, since their possessors view them only as means to an end and not owned goods in and of themselves.Hindsight Bias: This is the tendency to see events that have already happened as being inevitable, even if they were unpredictable beforehand, and more generally as a tendency to edit memories in response to newly-provided information. This often shows up in accidents, where people suffer blame far out of proportion to the probability of the accident, and is especially damaging in trials, where juries will tend to assume that the probabilities of events are higher than they actually were. That also leads decision-makers to spend a large amount of resources on materials and policies to deflect blame, even if it makes things objectively worse (zero-tolerance policies at schools, for example)Regression to the Mean: Great successes tend to be followed by disappointing performance and dismal failure tends to be followed by improvement simply because over time, there are more incidents closer to the average than not. This can cause undue suffering, as in the example given of Israeli pilots. The instructor mentions the criticism is better than praise, because pilots tend to improve after they're criticized and get worse after they're praised. However, this isn't causal, it's just regression to the mean, and considering other research on praise vs. criticism, it's actively detrimental.Risk Aversion: People rate losses as worse than gains, and evaluate chances based not on their probability, but as weighted by whether it's a gain or loss. Furthermore, they tend to prefer certainty on gains, but will seek out risk over certainty for losses. As an example, consider two offers: in one, you can take $250 for sure or have a 30% chance to get $1000 and a 70% chance to get nothing, and in the other you can lose $700 for sure or have a 75% chance to lose $750 and a 25% chance to lose nothing. Most people will take the $250 on the first example and risk the gamble in the second, even though a strict accounting of probability would indicate it should be the other way around.Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect: Experiences are not evaluated in memory objectively. Instead, only two things tend to be considered--the highest (or lowest) single point, and the condition at the end. How long the experience lasted doesn't matter at all. In one example, an experimenter mentioned a certain women who had died of cancer at age 30 or age 60 after having lived a happy life. People were asked to evaluate her life, and the 30-year and 60-year groups generally rated it the same quality even though one was twice as long. However, when she lived 35 years or 65 years, and the last 5 years were not as happy as the preceding years, her quality of life was rated lower than the 30- or 60-year versions even though the total time was longer. These biases are also why people in new relationships after an acrimonious breakup tend to assume their new relationship is orders of magnitude better than their previous one, even if they had many happy years together before its end, simply because it ended badly.Cognitive Energy: Engaging System 2 takes effort, literally, and we try to avoid it when we don't want to. Furthermore, we're worse at it when depleted of energy. In one highly depressing example, a group of judges evaluating parole cases were studied, and it was found that the probability of them granting parole was directly proportional to how long it had been since they last ate. When they started for the day, the rate was 65% of cases granted parole, but right before lunch it was almost 0. That means that how hungry the judge was has a higher influence on parole applications than the merits of the case!WYSIATI: System 1 doesn't take any information into account other than what is directly in front of it, even if using System 2 makes it obvious that that information is highly relevant. One example is dolphins vs. orphans. The experimenter asked a group of people how much money they would donate to charity in two separate cases--saving dolphins and saving orphans. If the examples were given singly, then the average amount given to dolphins was almost three times the amount given to orphans. If they were given together, though, then the amount given to orphans beat the amount given to dolphins because now there was a new piece of information--orphans are human, dolphins are not--that previously was ignored because even though it was highly relevant, it wasn't part of the problem presented.Feminist Bank Teller: I don't remember the formal name for this one either, but it's an error of categorization. People were presented with a description of a person, including that she was outspoken, active in women's rights organizations, brash, etc., and then asked what careers she was likely to join. ""Feminist bank teller"" was weighted higher than ""bank teller"" both on lists where they appeared singly and when they appeared together, even though all feminist bank tellers are also bank tellers and therefore bank teller must be higher probability. A similar problem can be seen with coin flips. Most people will rate THHHTH as a more likely sequence than THHH, even though the first sequence is simply the second one with extra tosses added and therefore can only be less likely.There are literally dozens of other examples I haven't mentioned, because the review simply doesn't have enough space and anyway, there's already a book (and reams of psychology research) about it. And you should read it. Everyone should read it. Everyone should know about what is going on in their mind without their knowledge.Though one warning: Thinking, Fast and Slow is extremely dense. As another review mentions, it's not always clear whether he's writing this book for psychologists or a lay audience, and some parts may require several read-throughs to figure out what Kahneman is saying and the implications thereof.Then again, maybe that's just because System 2 is lazy and dumping things onto System 1.It's not automatically as horrible as I make it out. Kahneman specifically emphasizes that our minds are set up this way because the vast majority of the time, it's good enough to function and survive. To me, though, this really is Lovecraftian--in Lovecraft's stories it was alien races and sleeping deities manipulating humanity without humanity's knowledge, and here it's the unconscious processes in our own mind. I value rationality very highly and do my best to try to be rational, but this book makes a very good case that rationality is literally impossible except in certain specific cases, and it can't be sustained since System 2 takes energy, and the more energy you use, the more likely System 2 is to give up and dump everything back on System 1 even if you know about all of these cognitive errors.So, you might find this book horribly depressing, like I did, or you may find it inspiring, like someone else I know, who said that knowing about all the natural errors in human cognition is the first step in developing a way to fix them. But either way, you should read it, because there's little that's more important to understand than the workings of your own mind."
209,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446434-hundeschlitten,2,"There are some interesting ideas here, but why do so many of these left-brain science types insist on writing their own books? Like a lot of generalized overviews written by some expert in his or her field, Daniel Kahneman's survey of the current ideas surrounding behavioral economics was a real chore to slog through at times. The book is broken into five sections and, at least to me, things really didn't start getting interesting until section three. In the first two sections, there are just too many experiments Kahneman felt the need to summarize, almost all demonstrating some way in which our decision making is less than entirely efficient. At times, I felt like I was plodding across the written equivalent of the Oregon Trail, with no end in sight. In Part Three, Kahneman begins to use these experiments to dismantle the concepts of the Chicago school of economics, which is based on the concept that we are all rational actors. But then Kahneman accepts the theory of ""highly efficient markets"" as a given, which makes no sense if their participants aren't being rational. So even here, Kahneman loses me. But at least he's being topical.Part Four features more experiments, most of which attempt to find ways in which you can trick otherwise intelligent people into making non-sensible decisions.Part Five is the most intellectually interesting part of the book, as Kahneman posits an experiencing self and a remembering self, and what this implies about how we make decisions. So unless you read very quickly, my advice is to begin at page 199, and feel free to skim some of the chapters (which are numerous but mercifully short) until you get to the final section on the two selves, which begins on page 377.

As I read it, page after page was covered in notes, 'yes' 'no' 'really?' 'but'....What Kahneman discusses in this book is something we've all known in a less rigorous way, perhaps - the intuitive and the analytical paths to decision making and action.Two SystemsPsychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the two modes of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2.System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.The labels of System 1 and System 2 are widely used in psychology, but I go further than most in this book, which you can read as a psychodrama with two characters.Surely you chess and bridge players are already sitting up and paying attention. We all know about that psychodrama. He continues:When we think if ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book. I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 general surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1. You will be invited to think of the two systems as agents with their individual abilities, limitations, and functions.Of course this hasn't been written with game players in mind, and you may, like me, find yourself disagreeing with some of the ideas here. For a start, System 1 is based on the infinite hard work of System 2. As far as playing games go, you aren't born with S1, it grows and improves because of S2. However, it is definitely food for thought and may help clarify aspects of how you are thinking and how you might address issues.Educational and sometimes astonishing when it comes to how bad we humans are at dealing with data.

211,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859963-suhrob,5,"In ""Thinking, fast and slow"" the Nobel laureate Danny Kahneman summarizes his life long work mostly done with his collegue (and Nobel corecipient) Amos Tversky in the field of cognitive psychology and decision making.There has been an outcrop of books on this topic in the recent years (Ariely and Lehrer being the bigger names) and there is a significant overlap with similar books. However, for the seriously interested I'd recommend to start here. This is the original reference, the user manual for your brain.The scope of the book is large but Kahneman tries to make the topics more accessible by anthropomorphising the two cognitive ""systems"" in interplay in human decision making (though giving them the non descript names ""1"" and ""2""). The chapters end with examples (""soundbites"") where the introduced concepts are used in real life settings. This attempt at accessibility is, in my opinion, undermined by the 400 page tome which might be too intimidating to some. But I can understand the tension between trying to be influential and trying to summarize a whole field and life long work.Apart from that, the book is very lean, you won't find any cutesy stories or participatory journalism. Just concept after concept and the relevant research. But don't let that discourage you - the book is well written and structured. I consider the lack of fluff a big plus.Kahneman is skeptical that even learning about all these cognitive biases can make a change on individual level, but hopes something can be done on institutional level. The whole thing is a bit saddening. We are really running on a to me still very impressive, but at the same time, very flawed system. The sheer scope how irrelevant factors influence our decision making even on highest levels is frightening.I am generally very optimistic about the future of humanity and would love to be around to see where it goes, but if we get there, if we are ever to make it, it will be only with a lots of luck.An essential book."

215,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Kahneman divides the way we think into two “systems”. These are not actual entities, but constructs that represent distinct modes of thought. System 1 is our intuitive sense covering ideas and feelings that just pop into our heads without effort. System 2 is our reasoning, rational sense that we use when we deliberately think things through. He offers many different scenarios that determine whether System 1 or System 2 is engaged. Realizing that this determination itself is often automatic can leave you feeling a little less in control. Kahneman shows us how many ways our thinking can go off track. Our immediate thoughts occur by association, resemblance to the familiar or because they represent our expectations. We jump to conclusions because it is the easiest thing to do. Our minds have an inherent laziness. We often stick with the first thought that comes to mind even though the situation calls for engaging System 2. If a question is just too hard for System 1, System 1 will make it simpler so we can forgo the mental work of engaging System 2.`Even when System 2 does engage, System 1 can subvert it without us being aware. Priming is the effect of being influenced by prior unrelated information. For example, Kahneman points to experiments that show just hearing something about money makes our subsequent behavior more self-centered. Anchoring refers to hearing or seeing a fact that sets a beginning point for evaluation of a subsequent problem. Just putting a number in the mind can make it a starting point for thinking about anything that comes next. Setting targets unrealistically high or low is used by negotiators to make their real goals seem more reasonable. Representativeness is about using stereotypes or imputing one quality from another similar to the halo effect. The halo effect occurs when current opinions often formed by System 1 shape subsequent judgements even if they are about something completely unrelated. For example if you find someone personable you are more likely to think they are also generous. Availability refers to anything that we hear repeatedly, which will be quickly recalled and used by System 1. And of course any judgement, snap or not, is subject to our emotions and mood. Preceding unrelated events may change the decisions we make. While System 1 operates at the WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) level ignoring information not immediately at hand, it can add things that are not there. It imputes motive and intent. It postulates connections between events. When System 1 is challenged by limited information it fills in the blanks. This may be very useful in some situations, but it also leads to unsupported assumptions and conspiracy theories.Most people tend to overconfidence in their judgement. We think we know more than we do. We underestimate randomness and put too much faith in patterns that are often temporary or simply imagined. We ignore baselines of activity and are overly influenced by recent events even though reversion to the mean is typically a better predictor of future outcomes. Intuition can be helpful but only when used by experts in fields where statistically significant correlations exist. Kahneman challenges conventional economic theory that assumes people are rational when they buy or sell. He identifies many influences that make economic decisions subjective. Key is loss aversion vs. gain. Losses are more psychologically painful and thus fear of them overweight decisions to avoid them. Context is very important. The significance of the amount to your personal situation matters. Just owning something increases its value to the owner. Framing is important. The language describing a transaction will invoke a System 1 response. Preceding transactions alter perception of the value of subsequent ones. Kahneman gives many more examples and decimates the notion of the rational consumer.Another fascinating concept concerns how we view our lives. Are we the experienced self or the remembered self? The experienced self consists of our feelings as we lived them, the other as they are remembered. The two are different. A twenty year marriage that was happy for 19 out of twenty years is very positive for the experienced self, but if the marriage ended in a bitter divorce it might all be remembered very negatively. A more mundane example is choosing a vacation. Do you choose a familiar place you know you like or a more stressful one that will create memories? The way we remember our lives does not match the way we lived them.Clearly this is a book to shake up your sense of self, and if you are like me you will enjoy the challenge. It also helps us to understand others and our relationships, although Kahneman doesn’t specifically target that aspect. I couldn’t keep from thinking of how System 1 and System 2 applied to people’s thinking in this year’s presidential election. Kahneman’s presentation is clear even for something as tricky as Bayesian analysis. My notes above cover only a small sample of the ideas in the book. I think most readers will find something to appreciate. Highly recommended. "
216,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,2,"Daniel Kahneman is a psychology professor at Princeton University who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on decision making. His book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is a journey through his theories with a primary focus on the business world and its failure to adequately apply statistical information to its predictive practices. What you should know, you ambitious soul, prior to picking up this work, is that the man is going to harsh your buzz and take great evil joy in doing it.Professor Kahneman suggests there are two systems in operation when we think. System One is quick, intuition-based and emotional. System Two is more deliberately analytical. Most decisions are made by System One because, according to Kahneman, System Two is a lazy goose and prefers not to exert the effort. That laziness is the reason we put our (misguided) faith in instinct, skill, confidence, expertise, personal experience and our own judgment when, really, we should confine ourselves to consulting the relevant available statistics. Just look at the facts, Jack. Stop indulging in the fantasy that you properly understand the past or can in any way predict the future. Forget what you think you know. You don't. You can't. And Kahneman, through chapters and chapters of interactive exercise and discourse, goes a long way toward proving this.Lots of people who know far more than I do about behavioral economics like this book and are five-star impressed by the material. Alas, I'm a visceral kid, so my considerations here are going to be a little off the statistical beaten path. For instance, Kahneman relays a story about a speaking engagement he once had with a group of investment advisers. Given a spreadsheet conveying the choices made by twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers over the course of eight consecutive years, the professor performs his calculations and proves to the top executives that financial expertise played no part in the outcome of those investments. Predictive acumen was absent. To quote: ""The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill."" Kahneman continues:The next morning we reported the findings to the advisers, and their response was equally bland. Their own experience of exercising careful judgment on complex problems was far more compelling to them than an obscure statistical fact. When we were done, one of the executives I had dined with the previous evening drove me to the airport. He told me, with a trace of defensiveness, ""I have done very well for the firm and no one can take that away from me."" I smiled and said nothing. But I thought, ""Well, I took it away from you this morning. If your success was due mostly to chance, how much credit are you entitled to take from it?""Now this interests me, this trollish glee. It interests and informs me. It also calls to mind several recent studies done in the area of clinical depression. Results are beginning to emerge to suggest those who suffer from this dark and pernicious despair may actually have a better grip on reality than those who don't. The depressed may indeed be seeing the world more clearly than the rest, and this may be why they're depressed - which brings to light the possibly essential role of denial in our lives. What we are able to repress on a daily basis - the inevitability of death, loss, sickness, natural and unnatural disaster; the random and entirely arbitrary nature of the universe; the cruelty of man; the unfairness of society, the powerlessness of the individual to effect measurable change - may indeed preserve our psychic well-being. Ignorance may not merely be bliss, it may be what's keeping us sane.Which is not to say, of course, that we shouldn't keep exploring and investigating and uncovering new truths. And it's not to say we should ignore the progress being made in all fields of endeavor. What draws my attention here is Kahneman's System One conveyance of his information - which seems pat, hubristic and ill-considered to me. He may have come up with certain statistical realities that illuminate the folly of our confidence in our own decision-making capacities. He may be correct in characterizing our faith in ourselves as ""delusional optimism."" But he doesn't go the extra mile of engaging the System Two segment of his brain to analyze the function such ""blind"" self-assurance may serve in regard to psychic health - a knowledge which sets up the much more intriguing question of whether it's more important to be right in the world, or right with it.Hey, we're all human. And, as it turns out, Kahneman's more human than most. But seriously, Professor, seriously...I could have done without that very high horse."
217,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow is an extremely well researched book - in fact painstakingly so. The book starts with a basic premise: we think fast at times based on intuition, and slow where more analysis is required. After discussing the concept in fair detail, the book goes on to list with excellent examples thinking biases especially with fast thinking. The examples are a mix of basic math, every day experiences, economic theory and others. There are also towards the end examples of satisfaction with life. This is a book which needs to be read slowly though and is a very serious read - it is very detailed in it's treatment."
218,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12520565-richard,2,"Kahneman is a brilliant thinker who's small experiments cracked the foundations of neo-classical/rational choice theory. His collections like Choices, Values and Frames are terrific reading, full of extraordinarily disorienting observations of actual human behavior. That said, this book was a bit of a disappointment. In this book, Kahneman weaves together a series of ideas based on his experiments and the experiments of like-minded researchers, and the effect is underwhelming. Gone is the careful exploration of small twists in human behavior, replaced with broad, rolling declarations that are only weakly supported by the data. For most of the experiments he cites, he fails to talk about the power of the findings (were participants 40% more likely to do something when framed a certain way? Or 4% more likely? Or 400%?). Sure, this is a book for a wider audience than his journal articles or academic collections, but I found that the dumbing down went too far. Too bad. The basic research that made Kahneman a star is fabulous. Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice is a great example - a review of experiments involving no more than some college students and coffee mugs, with counterintuitive findings about loss and market prices. Kahneman is at his best when he lets the reader figure out the implications of his stunning findings.Also, his dual process theory of thought - System 1 and System 2 - seems the less powerful of two competing views of human reason. A skeptic might ask what evidence is there that System 2 exists at all. System 2 certainly seems to be no less vulnerable to confirmation bias than System 1. The Mercier and Sperber formulation on the function of human reason just fits better with evolutionary models. Of course, that's probably just my confirmation bias kicking in."

If there is something I truly HATE is the self-importance of “behavioral experiments” or “psychological tests” applied to the behavior of groups of people. You know, for example when a test group is asked to press a button under certain conditions, or state their feelings while watching some images, etc. I don’t have any doubts: I just think they are bullshit, pure and simple. And psychology is NOT a science. I wouldn’t have gone to the lengths of researching this further, but on page 57 the authors come up with the following ridiculous display of hubris :  “The results of these experiments are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THESE STUDIES ARE TRUE.” Haha! Prompted by this rather odd, childish statement, I decided to do a little research of my own, and .... it turns out that only 2 years ago a thorough study (now become very famous in the field) proved that:1) the specific experiment quoted in this book called “ego depletion” is complete bunk. 2) unsurprisingly, the VAST MAJORITY of these experiments have a very serious “reproducibility problem”. Hence, they cannot be considered “science”, or anything remotely leading us to “undeniably true conclusions”. The principles underlying the experiments are true enough, but not because they are proved by the experiments. It’s because they are “elegantly presented common sense”.

He uses a multitude of examples and cases to illustrate the points he makes. The difficulty is rather in us, the readers. Kahneman's thesis, abundantly supported, is that all of us operate on two levels. Anyone who is at all familiar with psychology and research into the brain knows about our ""lizard brain."" Kahneman shows how this part of our makeup operates at a level far beyond the fight or flight response, affecting our everyday lives in ways that we are totally unaware of. More than that, it affects our reasoning processes in ways that I never imagined. And though one can peruse the text easily enough, it is very, very difficult to make the application to one's own thought processes. Kahneman makes it plain that we could all benefit from a greater degree of self-awareness and disciplined thinking that takes into account these unconscious influences, but actually applying that is hard. That said, his book explains a lot about how easily we are manipulated, and why we so often draw the wrong conclusions from our experience. He also accounts for ""experts"" who are so often wrong and why the future is so unpredictable."

Our teacher said it is a fascinating book and some other people I know had kind words to say about it as well; thus, I had high hopes for the book.I found the book tremendously tedious. There is too much text for all the points the author makes. Most of the time, I didn't even delve into the problem questions, which used way too much mathematical intuition.Now I understand why teachers don't want us to use 'you' form in essays.

That is a slow, engrossing grind of an academic tome, though.All the reviews have been glowing. Kahneman is golden, of course — he's ascended into the pantheon of the intelligentsia's demigods. The first one I read was from The Economist, then there was the one from the New York Times, and then I caught the one in The Wilson Quarterly, but what finally made really this the zeitgeist was when I came across a review in the fluffy “Paper” magazine (I was sitting in a coffeeshop waiting for some friends to finish a boardgame and picked up a free copy. More pop culture snuck into my brain in that twenty minutes than I permitted during the balance of 2011.)May 8th 2012 Update: The Economist chimes in with an aside: Foreign languages and thinking: Oprima dos for better cognition, in which they report on evidence that some of our cognitive flaws don't seem to interfere when we ponder the decision in a non-native language."

But Thinking Fast and Slow is, if I'm not mistaken, a summary of all of Kahneman's work from the last fifty years (or more?). It's gobstoppingly dense with studies Kahneman and his fellow researchers have devised to examine who people think, and I quell the thought of trying to comment on it.But I will gladly comment about it. Thinking Fast and Slow has been, over the weeks that I've been reading it, easily the book I've recommended most, and I admit having to suppress some excitement when someone tells me that they've ordered the book from Amazon. Even if you don't like economics, or maybe especially if you don't like economics, Kahneman's research is accessible to anyone with even a modicum of interest in society, decision-making, or how we think and exercise judgment. Rather than describe the world in terms of complex equations and graphs--though there are certainly a lot of graphs--Kahneman seems to be constantly devising thought experiments to understand how and why people act in certain situations. What a life it must be to be Kahneman, self-tasked with identifying the 'how' and 'why' of any particular decision, whether it is discerning who the best candidates are for officer training from among a cadre of soldiers during field exercises, or figuring out how to redesign the food pyramid to be a food pie, there seems to be no end of topics or situations where behavioral economics can be applied with some revelatory success.One part of especial interest to me was the section, near the end, when Kahneman begins to describe memory, pain, and suffering. If I understand right, Kahneman makes the point that research shows that it isn't the measurement of pleasure, happiness, or well-being over the duration of an event--such as a surgery, marriage, or vacation--that matters so much as how the event ends that we remember. Even if the event was, for the most part, a wonderful or positive experience we still remember the event based on how it ends. Shakespeare might put this as ""All's well that ends well."" For me, it's a paradigm-shifting insight about the importance not only of getting things right but also ending things right. How we remember things is, essentially, flawed, and what we are left with in memory often conflicts with what the experience was as a whole.Anyway, 
Thinking Fast and Slow 
is a great book. Prospect theory, framing, reference points, loss versus gain, and more are all raised and addressed and explored, and I am sure I will return to it again soon. I think I probably read it far too quickly, too eager to absorb concepts, and I feel there's more here to understand and examine."
224,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,2,"Have started skipping pages and chapters, seeking the really intriguing insights, which seem, most often, to be research other than that of Dr. Kahneman. Dr. Kahneman can devote most of a chapter to how he saved standardized tests for the Israeli military in the 1960´s. I think modesty is a big problem for him.Also, while it´s hard to imagine an academic community once utterly in thrall of perfect rationality, game theory, etc., the fact that mankind is not rational by rigid standards of logic now feels like a truism, and listing traps in statistical judgment that students fall into doesn´t make working rationality any more or less true. I sense that Dr. Kahneman also knows this.Like a book about the human brain I was picking through at roughly the same time, this is really a series of short papers written over quite a long time. It's likely that they contradict each other and somehow convey the illusion of complexity in the process.Is this the place to talk about problems with statistics as a science? Because Dr. Kahneman loves statistics, and wherever people fail at statitistics, Dr. Kahneman considers them irrational. This is self-serving, because he takes pains to point out that writers of statistics textbooks make basic statistical errors. He himself says he forgets to use large enough samples in studies sometimes.I attended a university which dedicated entire courses to the soft science of statistical failure, and then required I take those courses. One absolutely soporific professor Dr. Kahneman praises a great deal stood in front of my class and ""proved"" that statistically there is no reason to vote. Another ""proved"" that attacking Iraq was George Bush's only option in the Gulf War.Dr. Kahneman likes to say that a few simple measures are better than expert opinion. This is self-serving again, because results are measured by the same simple metrics. So, for example, experts are asked to predict the likelihood of a very limited number of distinctly defined options, multiple choice style. Or, in an example such as that of predicting the market for wine, the same growing conditions which are used to grade the quality of wine are used to predict its market value in the growing season. What a shock.This review is in danger of becoming as diffuse and confusing as the book. As another review points out, the book is fast and loose with statistics itself and essentially plays all sides of the field at once. I did browse some of the academic papers in the appendix and they weren't remarkable more consistent. It would be interesting to see the peer review process for those papers.Without having experienced the stifling milieu of absolute rationality in social sciences, I imagine we should be grateful for the comparative freedom Dr. Kahneman gave some students in the 50s. Still, per my update, the concluding pages of the book nearly sound like fascism. If statistics is the magical order of the universe, only to be discovered and worshipped by the select elite, well, the Dr. tells us that governments and companies, which are magically immune from (statistical) failures should be doing all of our thinking for us."
225,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"I've long wondered about the ""rational man"" of economic theory and have wondered if there was some kind of drug I could take that would enable me to be that person. And what did it mean that I--fully aware of my emotion-based spending (or, more likely, not spending) decisions--seemed, as a Prius owner, to be much more rational than the majority of American car buyers with their acceptance of insanely low mpg's?Having read this book, I now believe that the rational man of economic theory needs to be read out of the human race. (S)he has no more validity than the forecasting models that failed to predict the crash of 2008. For all practical purposes, as this book shows, we make judgments with our emotions *first*--and don't call on rationality unless we have to. Perhaps this is why Kahneman calls it System 1 (our ""just the facts ma'am"" side is System 2). Real thinking is hard work, and we are all slackers. We indulge in halo effects, we want to make correlations causative, we're easily influenced by extraneous sensory factors--the list of reason-dodging practices is an extensive one for which this book serves as a catalog.I spend a lot of time in board meetings as a result of my job. Even though the meetings aren't as dysfunctional as the ones in Dilbert, nonetheless I'm often disturbed by the pronounced unevenness of influence: those who express their opinions most often are the most influential; others keep their opinions to themselves until the final vote and then go along. I was delighted, then, when I saw this sentence: ""The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them."" Kahneman suggests a simple solution, which is simply to have everyone write down, before a meeting, a ""very brief summary of their position.""I might not be able to get this rule adopted. But if others fail to see its obvious wisdom, you can bet they will all be Hummer drivers."

In 2011 he published the best-seller, ""Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow"", a summary of his lifetimes work.DK has proved that our thinking patterns aren't half as smart as we might like to think they are. Our emotions like to think fast; in other words, jump to conclusions based on few facts and little analysis, leading to a belief that may well be largely irrational. Our intellect likes to think slowly, sifting facts, weighing judgements, possibly deciding the evidence is insufficient to reach any conclusion."
231,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"I don’t know how this book tastes like, it felt like a long night of cheese and wine maybe; sober. I couldn’t write a review easily, it took me a while to read, to ponder and now to write.Why this book? I am fascinated by decision making science (it was the subject of my Master’s thesis) and I am always looking for behavioral economics books such as Ariely’s and Taleb’s. Truth is, I don’t think I’ve read a better book about decision making; it is simply a psychological masterpiece. Kahneman is brilliant. The author (who is a Nobel Prize winner), in this book, attempts to deliver very complex scientific and detailed ideas about the human mind in a simplified way. The main idea of the book is that the human brain runs over 2 systems. System 1 “the automatic” is the intuitive and fast whereas system 2 is the slow thinker. These 2 systems are supposed to assist us with living this life , however they might cause us some problems because sometimes we need system 2 to do the work and system 1 is the one taking a decision. Here is an example, what is 2+2? Now what is 17x24? Well the answer to the first question is executed by system 1 whereas the second is by system 2.“System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgements you make.”When the answer is easy, we rarely double check with system 2. Here is a mind puzzling example he gives: (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.How much does the ball cost? _____ cents System 1 would immediately say 0.1, whereas the true answer is 0.05 (Do it on a paper). As a result, the quick fast system 1 might take shortcuts that are wrong while making a decision. There are several examples and at each I was amazed. Kahneman repeatedly labels system 2 as “lazy”: “We don’t want to think rigorously about something” that’s why most of the decisions are rather chosen easily and based on hunch or impression.The book is long 500 pages so I will just pinpoint a few ideas worth sharing: -	Avaliability Heuristic: We tend to make our choices based on the data available to us. People tend to highlight importance on easily retrieved data from memory. Kahneman indicates that most readilty available data is from memory. -	Priming: priming is also about what information we have before making a decision. For example, if you recently heard the word EAT, you are more likely to solve the word fragment SO_P by SOUP. But if you heard the word WASH, you’re most likely going to say SOAP. Priming occurs in system 1. -	Cognitive Ease: it is a cause and consequence of a pleasant feeling. A happy mood loosens the control of system2 over performance, when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. -	The halo effect: our tendency to judge a person or thing as good or bad even on things we haven’t obsereved. -	WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is.What I loved about the book is that it is more evidence of the simplicity of our brains (or stupidity) and how easily manipulated and fragile they are. We are far less rational than we think we are. Kahneman shows us all that through examples of simple everyday decisions. The book definietley doesn’t flow and it took me about 6 months to finish, sipping it and digesting it slowly. Don’t get me wrong, the style is simple but the content is heavy that you really would feel the need to put it down and ponder on the thought. The book changes your perception immediately. It made me question my previously made decisions, my feelings, my knowledge and definitely made me think more when I have system 1 kicking in for easily reachable answers. I recommend this book as a must read, but in case 500 pages is too much for you, read the chapters of “Overconfidence”, “Choices” and “Two Selves”. "
232,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,4,"If you are interested in learning more about how the brain works, which you should be, you need to read this book. This book treats with a fair amount of academic rigor the subjects that ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell addresses with anecdotes. This book covers research that Kahneman conducted over his career, including research which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. This book will destroy much of your confidence in your own cognitive functioning and decision-making processes, then give you the tools you need to step back and rebuild those processes in a more rational way. This takes deliberate effort, as you will see in this book if you are not already familiar with the various cognitive biases and heuristics our minds employ to interpret the vast stream of incoming data.Kahneman begins by describing two systems of cognitive function - System 1, which operates quickly, emotionally, and subconsciously, and System 2, which operates slowly, consciously, and logically. The rest of the book is written within the framework of these two systems.Next, Kahneman describes a series of cognitive biases and heuristics that are responsible for our frequent struggles to think rationally and logically. Many of these involve our minds' failures to accurately apply statistical thinking to decision-making, and they account for many of our ""snap judgments"" which turn out to be baseless and false. We are afflicted by MANY cognitive biases, and this book is not exhaustive, but it does a great job of describing and discussing the several that it presents. If you are interested in a quick, easy overview of a broader range of these cognitive biases, check out You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney. This book is by no means academically rigorous as Kahneman's book is, but provides a much broader overview of these errors in our thought processes.Kahneman goes on to discuss Prospect Theory (for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics) in the context of these two systems. He delves a bit into behavioral economics and explains how and why humans differ in their behavior from the perfectly rational ""Econ"" that is the subject of study in the field of Economics. He also discusses how to avoid some of the shortcomings of our fast, subconscious thought processes in our day-to-day lives.Finally, Kahneman takes the two-system model and expands it into a ""two-self"" model with an ""experiential self"" and a ""remembered self."" He discusses these two selves in the context of multiple experiments he conducted to try to study happiness and comes to a rather astonishing conclusion about the impacts of duration and intensity of unpleasant events on perceived unpleasantness. The bottom line: we all (ostensibly) have brains, and we all struggle (to vastly varying degrees) on a day to day basis to make good decisions, to think logically and rationally, and to maximize our own happiness. If you want to get better at doing these things, read this book."

Well, I decided to think slow and read this treacherous tedious demon of a book and there was nothing in this book I wouldn't have gotten from reading the first few chapters.The only circumstances I would recommend this book is if I was starting a book club and I wanted the book club to fail.

I enjoyed it just as much as I had enjoyed Rolf Dobelli's The Art of Thinking Clearly which I reference often when it comes to fallacies. Kahneman's metaphorical division of the mental life into two systems, fast and slow, makes the book quite interesting no matter how much one has read about the brain, mind, cognition and emotions. The goa, as Kahneman puts it, is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. Memory, he writes is and attribute of System 1, while deliberate checking and search are characteristics of System 2. Hence: ""Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.""My favorite quote from the book, perhaps because it is relevant to the current global, socio-political issues is this: ""A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."""
236,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577651-said-almaskery,4,The only reason I didn't give the book a 5 star is its length. The book is excellent in all aspects and tries to explain our biases and natural tendancies towards specific acts.

238,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,5,"This is quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read. Not because the author attempts to make it that way, but just because of the implications. I shelved in under horror somewhat in jest, but I really do think that the book is Lovecraftian--not in the tentacles and unpronounceable names sense, but in the cosmic horror and nihilism sense:The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of CthulhuThat ""inability to correlate its contents"" is really what Thinking, Fast and Slow is about.Let me explain. The main thesis of the book is that decision making and evaluation of the world can primarily be sorted into two broad processes in the mind, which Kahneman calls ""System 1"" and ""System 2."" System 1 is intuitive, uses heuristics to evaluate information, is effortless, only deals with current information (WYSIATI, or ""What You See Is All There Is""), constructs causal narratives, and fast. System 2 is contemplative, judges based on logic, requires effort to engage, separates events properly, and is slow. Hence the book's title.Note that these terms don't refer to any single identifiable brain structure or thought process. They're simply ways of categorizing how the brain works.After a brief explanation of these systems, the rest of the book is a gigantic litany of all the ways in which humans are, essentially, buffeted by subconscious processes over which they have no control. And I use that phrase deliberately, because there are multiple examples of psychologists, including Kahneman himself, falling victim to the cognitive disortions depicted therein, even when they know about them and even directly after having exactly what they did wrong explained to them.The main reason for that is that thinking is hard. Most of the time, System 1 is good enough, especially for our savannah-dwelling hominid ancestors, and System 2 requires much more energy than relying on System 1, so we're reluctant to engage in it unless absolutely necessary and take basically every opportunity to switch back to System 1.So, here are some examples:The Halo Effect: How one's judgement of a person's actions is influenced by their overall character. If you like your boss, you're likely to interpret their sticking to a plan in the face of adversity as being even-tempered, cautious, persistent, and thoughtful. If you don't like them, you're likely to view the exact same actions as rigid, stubborn, and tyrannical. Another example is how more attractive people tend to be thought of as kinder or more intelligent than less attractive people even in the absence of evidence.Priming: Priming is changing estimates or judgements based on information that may not have anything to do with the judgement. The major example in the book is a wheel of fortune rigged to stop at either 10 or 65, and after spinning it, participants would be asked how many African countries are members of the U.N. The average answer for people who got a 10 was 25, and the average for people who got a 65 was 45. More disturbingly, judges with an average of fifteen years' experience rolled weighted dice designed to get either 3 or 9 before evaluating cases to determine sentencing. If the dice got 3, the average sentence was 5 months. If it was 9, it was 8 months.Endowment Effect: Owning something is better than not owning it, and getting it is better than giving it away. One example given is a oenophile who refuses to buy wine at more than $30 and refuses to sell it at more than $100. According to economic theory, that makes no sense. Well, it does--once bought, it has additional value since now it's owned, and owning something is more powerful than not owning it. Though it is pointed out that this doesn't tend to apply to cash or to retailers and their stock, since their possessors view them only as means to an end and not owned goods in and of themselves.Hindsight Bias: This is the tendency to see events that have already happened as being inevitable, even if they were unpredictable beforehand, and more generally as a tendency to edit memories in response to newly-provided information. This often shows up in accidents, where people suffer blame far out of proportion to the probability of the accident, and is especially damaging in trials, where juries will tend to assume that the probabilities of events are higher than they actually were. That also leads decision-makers to spend a large amount of resources on materials and policies to deflect blame, even if it makes things objectively worse (zero-tolerance policies at schools, for example)Regression to the Mean: Great successes tend to be followed by disappointing performance and dismal failure tends to be followed by improvement simply because over time, there are more incidents closer to the average than not. This can cause undue suffering, as in the example given of Israeli pilots. The instructor mentions the criticism is better than praise, because pilots tend to improve after they're criticized and get worse after they're praised. However, this isn't causal, it's just regression to the mean, and considering other research on praise vs. criticism, it's actively detrimental.Risk Aversion: People rate losses as worse than gains, and evaluate chances based not on their probability, but as weighted by whether it's a gain or loss. Furthermore, they tend to prefer certainty on gains, but will seek out risk over certainty for losses. As an example, consider two offers: in one, you can take $250 for sure or have a 30% chance to get $1000 and a 70% chance to get nothing, and in the other you can lose $700 for sure or have a 75% chance to lose $750 and a 25% chance to lose nothing. Most people will take the $250 on the first example and risk the gamble in the second, even though a strict accounting of probability would indicate it should be the other way around.Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect: Experiences are not evaluated in memory objectively. Instead, only two things tend to be considered--the highest (or lowest) single point, and the condition at the end. How long the experience lasted doesn't matter at all. In one example, an experimenter mentioned a certain women who had died of cancer at age 30 or age 60 after having lived a happy life. People were asked to evaluate her life, and the 30-year and 60-year groups generally rated it the same quality even though one was twice as long. However, when she lived 35 years or 65 years, and the last 5 years were not as happy as the preceding years, her quality of life was rated lower than the 30- or 60-year versions even though the total time was longer. These biases are also why people in new relationships after an acrimonious breakup tend to assume their new relationship is orders of magnitude better than their previous one, even if they had many happy years together before its end, simply because it ended badly.Cognitive Energy: Engaging System 2 takes effort, literally, and we try to avoid it when we don't want to. Furthermore, we're worse at it when depleted of energy. In one highly depressing example, a group of judges evaluating parole cases were studied, and it was found that the probability of them granting parole was directly proportional to how long it had been since they last ate. When they started for the day, the rate was 65% of cases granted parole, but right before lunch it was almost 0. That means that how hungry the judge was has a higher influence on parole applications than the merits of the case!WYSIATI: System 1 doesn't take any information into account other than what is directly in front of it, even if using System 2 makes it obvious that that information is highly relevant. One example is dolphins vs. orphans. The experimenter asked a group of people how much money they would donate to charity in two separate cases--saving dolphins and saving orphans. If the examples were given singly, then the average amount given to dolphins was almost three times the amount given to orphans. If they were given together, though, then the amount given to orphans beat the amount given to dolphins because now there was a new piece of information--orphans are human, dolphins are not--that previously was ignored because even though it was highly relevant, it wasn't part of the problem presented.Feminist Bank Teller: I don't remember the formal name for this one either, but it's an error of categorization. People were presented with a description of a person, including that she was outspoken, active in women's rights organizations, brash, etc., and then asked what careers she was likely to join. ""Feminist bank teller"" was weighted higher than ""bank teller"" both on lists where they appeared singly and when they appeared together, even though all feminist bank tellers are also bank tellers and therefore bank teller must be higher probability. A similar problem can be seen with coin flips. Most people will rate THHHTH as a more likely sequence than THHH, even though the first sequence is simply the second one with extra tosses added and therefore can only be less likely.There are literally dozens of other examples I haven't mentioned, because the review simply doesn't have enough space and anyway, there's already a book (and reams of psychology research) about it. And you should read it. Everyone should read it. Everyone should know about what is going on in their mind without their knowledge.Though one warning: Thinking, Fast and Slow is extremely dense. As another review mentions, it's not always clear whether he's writing this book for psychologists or a lay audience, and some parts may require several read-throughs to figure out what Kahneman is saying and the implications thereof.Then again, maybe that's just because System 2 is lazy and dumping things onto System 1.It's not automatically as horrible as I make it out. Kahneman specifically emphasizes that our minds are set up this way because the vast majority of the time, it's good enough to function and survive. To me, though, this really is Lovecraftian--in Lovecraft's stories it was alien races and sleeping deities manipulating humanity without humanity's knowledge, and here it's the unconscious processes in our own mind. I value rationality very highly and do my best to try to be rational, but this book makes a very good case that rationality is literally impossible except in certain specific cases, and it can't be sustained since System 2 takes energy, and the more energy you use, the more likely System 2 is to give up and dump everything back on System 1 even if you know about all of these cognitive errors.So, you might find this book horribly depressing, like I did, or you may find it inspiring, like someone else I know, who said that knowing about all the natural errors in human cognition is the first step in developing a way to fix them. But either way, you should read it, because there's little that's more important to understand than the workings of your own mind."
239,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446434-hundeschlitten,2,"There are some interesting ideas here, but why do so many of these left-brain science types insist on writing their own books? Like a lot of generalized overviews written by some expert in his or her field, Daniel Kahneman's survey of the current ideas surrounding behavioral economics was a real chore to slog through at times. The book is broken into five sections and, at least to me, things really didn't start getting interesting until section three. In the first two sections, there are just too many experiments Kahneman felt the need to summarize, almost all demonstrating some way in which our decision making is less than entirely efficient. At times, I felt like I was plodding across the written equivalent of the Oregon Trail, with no end in sight. In Part Three, Kahneman begins to use these experiments to dismantle the concepts of the Chicago school of economics, which is based on the concept that we are all rational actors. But then Kahneman accepts the theory of ""highly efficient markets"" as a given, which makes no sense if their participants aren't being rational. So even here, Kahneman loses me. But at least he's being topical.Part Four features more experiments, most of which attempt to find ways in which you can trick otherwise intelligent people into making non-sensible decisions.Part Five is the most intellectually interesting part of the book, as Kahneman posits an experiencing self and a remembering self, and what this implies about how we make decisions. So unless you read very quickly, my advice is to begin at page 199, and feel free to skim some of the chapters (which are numerous but mercifully short) until you get to the final section on the two selves, which begins on page 377.

As I read it, page after page was covered in notes, 'yes' 'no' 'really?' 'but'....What Kahneman discusses in this book is something we've all known in a less rigorous way, perhaps - the intuitive and the analytical paths to decision making and action.Two SystemsPsychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the two modes of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2.System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.The labels of System 1 and System 2 are widely used in psychology, but I go further than most in this book, which you can read as a psychodrama with two characters.Surely you chess and bridge players are already sitting up and paying attention. We all know about that psychodrama. He continues:When we think if ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book. I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 general surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1. You will be invited to think of the two systems as agents with their individual abilities, limitations, and functions.Of course this hasn't been written with game players in mind, and you may, like me, find yourself disagreeing with some of the ideas here. For a start, System 1 is based on the infinite hard work of System 2. As far as playing games go, you aren't born with S1, it grows and improves because of S2. However, it is definitely food for thought and may help clarify aspects of how you are thinking and how you might address issues.Educational and sometimes astonishing when it comes to how bad we humans are at dealing with data. There is a chapter dealing with Linda.  It's quite incredible to see that around 90% of undergrads at major universities (I assume US), when presented with details leading to this:rest here: https://alittleteaalittlechat.wordpre..."
241,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859963-suhrob,5,"In ""Thinking, fast and slow"" the Nobel laureate Danny Kahneman summarizes his life long work mostly done with his collegue (and Nobel corecipient) Amos Tversky in the field of cognitive psychology and decision making.There has been an outcrop of books on this topic in the recent years (Ariely and Lehrer being the bigger names) and there is a significant overlap with similar books. However, for the seriously interested I'd recommend to start here. This is the original reference, the user manual for your brain.The scope of the book is large but Kahneman tries to make the topics more accessible by anthropomorphising the two cognitive ""systems"" in interplay in human decision making (though giving them the non descript names ""1"" and ""2""). The chapters end with examples (""soundbites"") where the introduced concepts are used in real life settings. This attempt at accessibility is, in my opinion, undermined by the 400 page tome which might be too intimidating to some. But I can understand the tension between trying to be influential and trying to summarize a whole field and life long work.Apart from that, the book is very lean, you won't find any cutesy stories or participatory journalism. Just concept after concept and the relevant research. But don't let that discourage you - the book is well written and structured. I consider the lack of fluff a big plus.Kahneman is skeptical that even learning about all these cognitive biases can make a change on individual level, but hopes something can be done on institutional level. The whole thing is a bit saddening. We are really running on a to me still very impressive, but at the same time, very flawed system. The sheer scope how irrelevant factors influence our decision making even on highest levels is frightening.I am generally very optimistic about the future of humanity and would love to be around to see where it goes, but if we get there, if we are ever to make it, it will be only with a lots of luck.An essential book."

Just not always terribly consistent. That’s OK.A bit repetitive, parts of it were familiar from other books like Irrationality, and then there were parts that lost me completely, where even when I kicked my indolent system 2 into slovenly, grudging action, the sheer arithmetics of some examples just would not allow themselves to be beaten into submission, no matter how my pupils dilated and my heart rate went up. Never mind. Most of it was good. And funny too."

245,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Kahneman divides the way we think into two “systems”. These are not actual entities, but constructs that represent distinct modes of thought. System 1 is our intuitive sense covering ideas and feelings that just pop into our heads without effort. System 2 is our reasoning, rational sense that we use when we deliberately think things through. He offers many different scenarios that determine whether System 1 or System 2 is engaged. Realizing that this determination itself is often automatic can leave you feeling a little less in control. Kahneman shows us how many ways our thinking can go off track. Our immediate thoughts occur by association, resemblance to the familiar or because they represent our expectations. We jump to conclusions because it is the easiest thing to do. Our minds have an inherent laziness. We often stick with the first thought that comes to mind even though the situation calls for engaging System 2. If a question is just too hard for System 1, System 1 will make it simpler so we can forgo the mental work of engaging System 2.`Even when System 2 does engage, System 1 can subvert it without us being aware. Priming is the effect of being influenced by prior unrelated information. For example, Kahneman points to experiments that show just hearing something about money makes our subsequent behavior more self-centered. Anchoring refers to hearing or seeing a fact that sets a beginning point for evaluation of a subsequent problem. Just putting a number in the mind can make it a starting point for thinking about anything that comes next. Setting targets unrealistically high or low is used by negotiators to make their real goals seem more reasonable. Representativeness is about using stereotypes or imputing one quality from another similar to the halo effect. The halo effect occurs when current opinions often formed by System 1 shape subsequent judgements even if they are about something completely unrelated. For example if you find someone personable you are more likely to think they are also generous. Availability refers to anything that we hear repeatedly, which will be quickly recalled and used by System 1. And of course any judgement, snap or not, is subject to our emotions and mood. Preceding unrelated events may change the decisions we make. While System 1 operates at the WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) level ignoring information not immediately at hand, it can add things that are not there. It imputes motive and intent. It postulates connections between events. When System 1 is challenged by limited information it fills in the blanks. This may be very useful in some situations, but it also leads to unsupported assumptions and conspiracy theories.Most people tend to overconfidence in their judgement. We think we know more than we do. We underestimate randomness and put too much faith in patterns that are often temporary or simply imagined. We ignore baselines of activity and are overly influenced by recent events even though reversion to the mean is typically a better predictor of future outcomes. Intuition can be helpful but only when used by experts in fields where statistically significant correlations exist. Kahneman challenges conventional economic theory that assumes people are rational when they buy or sell. He identifies many influences that make economic decisions subjective. Key is loss aversion vs. gain. Losses are more psychologically painful and thus fear of them overweight decisions to avoid them. Context is very important. The significance of the amount to your personal situation matters. Just owning something increases its value to the owner. Framing is important. The language describing a transaction will invoke a System 1 response. Preceding transactions alter perception of the value of subsequent ones. Kahneman gives many more examples and decimates the notion of the rational consumer.Another fascinating concept concerns how we view our lives. Are we the experienced self or the remembered self? The experienced self consists of our feelings as we lived them, the other as they are remembered. The two are different. A twenty year marriage that was happy for 19 out of twenty years is very positive for the experienced self, but if the marriage ended in a bitter divorce it might all be remembered very negatively. A more mundane example is choosing a vacation. Do you choose a familiar place you know you like or a more stressful one that will create memories? The way we remember our lives does not match the way we lived them.Clearly this is a book to shake up your sense of self, and if you are like me you will enjoy the challenge. It also helps us to understand others and our relationships, although Kahneman doesn’t specifically target that aspect. I couldn’t keep from thinking of how System 1 and System 2 applied to people’s thinking in this year’s presidential election. Kahneman’s presentation is clear even for something as tricky as Bayesian analysis. My notes above cover only a small sample of the ideas in the book. I think most readers will find something to appreciate. Highly recommended. "
246,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,2,"Daniel Kahneman is a psychology professor at Princeton University who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on decision making. His book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is a journey through his theories with a primary focus on the business world and its failure to adequately apply statistical information to its predictive practices. What you should know, you ambitious soul, prior to picking up this work, is that the man is going to harsh your buzz and take great evil joy in doing it.Professor Kahneman suggests there are two systems in operation when we think. System One is quick, intuition-based and emotional. System Two is more deliberately analytical. Most decisions are made by System One because, according to Kahneman, System Two is a lazy goose and prefers not to exert the effort. That laziness is the reason we put our (misguided) faith in instinct, skill, confidence, expertise, personal experience and our own judgment when, really, we should confine ourselves to consulting the relevant available statistics. Just look at the facts, Jack. Stop indulging in the fantasy that you properly understand the past or can in any way predict the future. Forget what you think you know. You don't. You can't. And Kahneman, through chapters and chapters of interactive exercise and discourse, goes a long way toward proving this.Lots of people who know far more than I do about behavioral economics like this book and are five-star impressed by the material. Alas, I'm a visceral kid, so my considerations here are going to be a little off the statistical beaten path. For instance, Kahneman relays a story about a speaking engagement he once had with a group of investment advisers. Given a spreadsheet conveying the choices made by twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers over the course of eight consecutive years, the professor performs his calculations and proves to the top executives that financial expertise played no part in the outcome of those investments. Predictive acumen was absent. To quote: ""The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill."" Kahneman continues:The next morning we reported the findings to the advisers, and their response was equally bland. Their own experience of exercising careful judgment on complex problems was far more compelling to them than an obscure statistical fact. When we were done, one of the executives I had dined with the previous evening drove me to the airport. He told me, with a trace of defensiveness, ""I have done very well for the firm and no one can take that away from me."" I smiled and said nothing. But I thought, ""Well, I took it away from you this morning. If your success was due mostly to chance, how much credit are you entitled to take from it?""Now this interests me, this trollish glee. It interests and informs me. It also calls to mind several recent studies done in the area of clinical depression. Results are beginning to emerge to suggest those who suffer from this dark and pernicious despair may actually have a better grip on reality than those who don't. The depressed may indeed be seeing the world more clearly than the rest, and this may be why they're depressed - which brings to light the possibly essential role of denial in our lives. What we are able to repress on a daily basis - the inevitability of death, loss, sickness, natural and unnatural disaster; the random and entirely arbitrary nature of the universe; the cruelty of man; the unfairness of society, the powerlessness of the individual to effect measurable change - may indeed preserve our psychic well-being. Ignorance may not merely be bliss, it may be what's keeping us sane.Which is not to say, of course, that we shouldn't keep exploring and investigating and uncovering new truths. And it's not to say we should ignore the progress being made in all fields of endeavor. What draws my attention here is Kahneman's System One conveyance of his information - which seems pat, hubristic and ill-considered to me. He may have come up with certain statistical realities that illuminate the folly of our confidence in our own decision-making capacities. He may be correct in characterizing our faith in ourselves as ""delusional optimism."" But he doesn't go the extra mile of engaging the System Two segment of his brain to analyze the function such ""blind"" self-assurance may serve in regard to psychic health - a knowledge which sets up the much more intriguing question of whether it's more important to be right in the world, or right with it.Hey, we're all human. And, as it turns out, Kahneman's more human than most. But seriously, Professor, seriously...I could have done without that very high horse."
247,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow is an extremely well researched book - in fact painstakingly so. The book starts with a basic premise: we think fast at times based on intuition, and slow where more analysis is required. After discussing the concept in fair detail, the book goes on to list with excellent examples thinking biases especially with fast thinking. The examples are a mix of basic math, every day experiences, economic theory and others. There are also towards the end examples of satisfaction with life. This is a book which needs to be read slowly though and is a very serious read - it is very detailed in it's treatment."
248,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12520565-richard,2,"Kahneman is a brilliant thinker who's small experiments cracked the foundations of neo-classical/rational choice theory. His collections like Choices, Values and Frames are terrific reading, full of extraordinarily disorienting observations of actual human behavior. That said, this book was a bit of a disappointment. In this book, Kahneman weaves together a series of ideas based on his experiments and the experiments of like-minded researchers, and the effect is underwhelming. Gone is the careful exploration of small twists in human behavior, replaced with broad, rolling declarations that are only weakly supported by the data. For most of the experiments he cites, he fails to talk about the power of the findings (were participants 40% more likely to do something when framed a certain way? Or 4% more likely? Or 400%?). Sure, this is a book for a wider audience than his journal articles or academic collections, but I found that the dumbing down went too far. Too bad. The basic research that made Kahneman a star is fabulous. Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice is a great example - a review of experiments involving no more than some college students and coffee mugs, with counterintuitive findings about loss and market prices. Kahneman is at his best when he lets the reader figure out the implications of his stunning findings.Also, his dual process theory of thought - System 1 and System 2 - seems the less powerful of two competing views of human reason. A skeptic might ask what evidence is there that System 2 exists at all. System 2 certainly seems to be no less vulnerable to confirmation bias than System 1. The Mercier and Sperber formulation on the function of human reason just fits better with evolutionary models. Of course, that's probably just my confirmation bias kicking in."
249,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,3,"This is a comment on a specific element of the book, and not a review of the whole work. If there is something I truly HATE is the self-importance of “behavioral experiments” or “psychological tests” applied to the behavior of groups of people. You know, for example when a test group is asked to press a button under certain conditions, or state their feelings while watching some images, etc. I don’t have any doubts: I just think they are bullshit, pure and simple. And psychology is NOT a science. I wouldn’t have gone to the lengths of researching this further, but on page 57 the authors come up with the following ridiculous display of hubris :  “The results of these experiments are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THESE STUDIES ARE TRUE.” Haha! Prompted by this rather odd, childish statement, I decided to do a little research of my own, and .... it turns out that only 2 years ago a thorough study (now become very famous in the field) proved that:1) the specific experiment quoted in this book called “ego depletion” is complete bunk. 2) unsurprisingly, the VAST MAJORITY of these experiments have a very serious “reproducibility problem”. Hence, they cannot be considered “science”, or anything remotely leading us to “undeniably true conclusions”. The principles underlying the experiments are true enough, but not because they are proved by the experiments. It’s because they are “elegantly presented common sense”. Here is an article about the study. Enjoy. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_..."

He uses a multitude of examples and cases to illustrate the points he makes. The difficulty is rather in us, the readers. Kahneman's thesis, abundantly supported, is that all of us operate on two levels. Anyone who is at all familiar with psychology and research into the brain knows about our ""lizard brain."" Kahneman shows how this part of our makeup operates at a level far beyond the fight or flight response, affecting our everyday lives in ways that we are totally unaware of. More than that, it affects our reasoning processes in ways that I never imagined. And though one can peruse the text easily enough, it is very, very difficult to make the application to one's own thought processes. Kahneman makes it plain that we could all benefit from a greater degree of self-awareness and disciplined thinking that takes into account these unconscious influences, but actually applying that is hard. That said, his book explains a lot about how easily we are manipulated, and why we so often draw the wrong conclusions from our experience. He also accounts for ""experts"" who are so often wrong and why the future is so unpredictable."
251,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Do you remember the feeling when your teacher asked you to read some pages from your textbook at home? You might have started off reading very carefully to get the point of every sentence, but as your reading progressed you got more and more bored, and finally you were flying your eyes over the last pages.That was the case with this book - we had to read it for our psychology class. Our teacher said it is a fascinating book and some other people I know had kind words to say about it as well; thus, I had high hopes for the book.I found the book tremendously tedious. There is too much text for all the points the author makes. Most of the time, I didn't even delve into the problem questions, which used way too much mathematical intuition.Now I understand why teachers don't want us to use 'you' form in essays. I couldn't stand his use of 'you' forms as if he thought he could read our minds. Most of the things he talked about were obvious anyway."

Hey, at least I was reading Kahneman before he won that Nobel Prize, before he got really popular. But I have to admit I never actually finished his Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases — it was due back at the library when I was only halfway through. That is a slow, engrossing grind of an academic tome, though.All the reviews have been glowing. Kahneman is golden, of course — he's ascended into the pantheon of the intelligentsia's demigods. The first one I read was from The Economist, then there was the one from the New York Times, and then I caught the one in The Wilson Quarterly, but what finally made really this the zeitgeist was when I came across a review in the fluffy “Paper” magazine (I was sitting in a coffeeshop waiting for some friends to finish a boardgame and picked up a free copy. More pop culture snuck into my brain in that twenty minutes than I permitted during the balance of 2011.)May 8th 2012 Update: The Economist chimes in with an aside: Foreign languages and thinking: Oprima dos for better cognition, in which they report on evidence that some of our cognitive flaws don't seem to interfere when we ponder the decision in a non-native language."

Thinking Fast and Slow
. It's so chock full of fantastic ideas, insights, and information that I'm afraid even trying to comment on it will make me look like a fool.Let me just say, then, that Thinking Fast and Slow is absolutely fascinating, a book worth reading and rereading, especially if you're of the self-improvement, self-examining type. Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner for his work in Behavioral Economics has a fascinating mind, and I felt like I had a front-row seat to one of the most incredible lectures about decision making, heuristics, and judgment that had ever been given.And here's where I start to worry about sounding like a fool: this just isn't my field of expertise. Sure, I love learning and I consider myself to be, in many respects, an autodidact. But Thinking Fast and Slow is, if I'm not mistaken, a summary of all of Kahneman's work from the last fifty years (or more?). It's gobstoppingly dense with studies Kahneman and his fellow researchers have devised to examine who people think, and I quell the thought of trying to comment on it.But I will gladly comment about it. Thinking Fast and Slow has been, over the weeks that I've been reading it, easily the book I've recommended most, and I admit having to suppress some excitement when someone tells me that they've ordered the book from Amazon. Even if you don't like economics, or maybe especially if you don't like economics, Kahneman's research is accessible to anyone with even a modicum of interest in society, decision-making, or how we think and exercise judgment. Rather than describe the world in terms of complex equations and graphs--though there are certainly a lot of graphs--Kahneman seems to be constantly devising thought experiments to understand how and why people act in certain situations. What a life it must be to be Kahneman, self-tasked with identifying the 'how' and 'why' of any particular decision, whether it is discerning who the best candidates are for officer training from among a cadre of soldiers during field exercises, or figuring out how to redesign the food pyramid to be a food pie, there seems to be no end of topics or situations where behavioral economics can be applied with some revelatory success.One part of especial interest to me was the section, near the end, when Kahneman begins to describe memory, pain, and suffering. If I understand right, Kahneman makes the point that research shows that it isn't the measurement of pleasure, happiness, or well-being over the duration of an event--such as a surgery, marriage, or vacation--that matters so much as how the event ends that we remember. Even if the event was, for the most part, a wonderful or positive experience we still remember the event based on how it ends. Shakespeare might put this as ""All's well that ends well."" For me, it's a paradigm-shifting insight about the importance not only of getting things right but also ending things right. How we remember things is, essentially, flawed, and what we are left with in memory often conflicts with what the experience was as a whole.Anyway, 
Thinking Fast and Slow 
is a great book. Prospect theory, framing, reference points, loss versus gain, and more are all raised and addressed and explored, and I am sure I will return to it again soon. I think I probably read it far too quickly, too eager to absorb concepts, and I feel there's more here to understand and examine."
254,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,2,"Have started skipping pages and chapters, seeking the really intriguing insights, which seem, most often, to be research other than that of Dr. Kahneman. Dr. Kahneman can devote most of a chapter to how he saved standardized tests for the Israeli military in the 1960´s. I think modesty is a big problem for him.Also, while it´s hard to imagine an academic community once utterly in thrall of perfect rationality, game theory, etc., the fact that mankind is not rational by rigid standards of logic now feels like a truism, and listing traps in statistical judgment that students fall into doesn´t make working rationality any more or less true. I sense that Dr. Kahneman also knows this.Like a book about the human brain I was picking through at roughly the same time, this is really a series of short papers written over quite a long time. It's likely that they contradict each other and somehow convey the illusion of complexity in the process.Is this the place to talk about problems with statistics as a science? Because Dr. Kahneman loves statistics, and wherever people fail at statitistics, Dr. Kahneman considers them irrational. This is self-serving, because he takes pains to point out that writers of statistics textbooks make basic statistical errors. He himself says he forgets to use large enough samples in studies sometimes.I attended a university which dedicated entire courses to the soft science of statistical failure, and then required I take those courses. One absolutely soporific professor Dr. Kahneman praises a great deal stood in front of my class and ""proved"" that statistically there is no reason to vote. Another ""proved"" that attacking Iraq was George Bush's only option in the Gulf War.Dr. Kahneman likes to say that a few simple measures are better than expert opinion. This is self-serving again, because results are measured by the same simple metrics. So, for example, experts are asked to predict the likelihood of a very limited number of distinctly defined options, multiple choice style. Or, in an example such as that of predicting the market for wine, the same growing conditions which are used to grade the quality of wine are used to predict its market value in the growing season. What a shock.This review is in danger of becoming as diffuse and confusing as the book. As another review points out, the book is fast and loose with statistics itself and essentially plays all sides of the field at once. I did browse some of the academic papers in the appendix and they weren't remarkable more consistent. It would be interesting to see the peer review process for those papers.Without having experienced the stifling milieu of absolute rationality in social sciences, I imagine we should be grateful for the comparative freedom Dr. Kahneman gave some students in the 50s. Still, per my update, the concluding pages of the book nearly sound like fascism. If statistics is the magical order of the universe, only to be discovered and worshipped by the select elite, well, the Dr. tells us that governments and companies, which are magically immune from (statistical) failures should be doing all of our thinking for us."
255,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"I've long wondered about the ""rational man"" of economic theory and have wondered if there was some kind of drug I could take that would enable me to be that person. And what did it mean that I--fully aware of my emotion-based spending (or, more likely, not spending) decisions--seemed, as a Prius owner, to be much more rational than the majority of American car buyers with their acceptance of insanely low mpg's?Having read this book, I now believe that the rational man of economic theory needs to be read out of the human race. (S)he has no more validity than the forecasting models that failed to predict the crash of 2008. For all practical purposes, as this book shows, we make judgments with our emotions *first*--and don't call on rationality unless we have to. Perhaps this is why Kahneman calls it System 1 (our ""just the facts ma'am"" side is System 2). Real thinking is hard work, and we are all slackers. We indulge in halo effects, we want to make correlations causative, we're easily influenced by extraneous sensory factors--the list of reason-dodging practices is an extensive one for which this book serves as a catalog.I spend a lot of time in board meetings as a result of my job. Even though the meetings aren't as dysfunctional as the ones in Dilbert, nonetheless I'm often disturbed by the pronounced unevenness of influence: those who express their opinions most often are the most influential; others keep their opinions to themselves until the final vote and then go along. I was delighted, then, when I saw this sentence: ""The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them."" Kahneman suggests a simple solution, which is simply to have everyone write down, before a meeting, a ""very brief summary of their position.""I might not be able to get this rule adopted. But if others fail to see its obvious wisdom, you can bet they will all be Hummer drivers."

He’s almost 80 years old, this makes for a lot of wisdom.The goal of the book is to give us names to the most common errors of judgement we make.

In 2011 he published the best-seller, ""Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow"", a summary of his lifetimes work.DK has proved that our thinking patterns aren't half as smart as we might like to think they are. Our emotions like to think fast; in other words, jump to conclusions based on few facts and little analysis, leading to a belief that may well be largely irrational. Our intellect likes to think slowly, sifting facts, weighing judgements, possibly deciding the evidence is insufficient to reach any conclusion."
261,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"I don’t know how this book tastes like, it felt like a long night of cheese and wine maybe; sober. I couldn’t write a review easily, it took me a while to read, to ponder and now to write.Why this book? I am fascinated by decision making science (it was the subject of my Master’s thesis) and I am always looking for behavioral economics books such as Ariely’s and Taleb’s. Truth is, I don’t think I’ve read a better book about decision making; it is simply a psychological masterpiece. Kahneman is brilliant. The author (who is a Nobel Prize winner), in this book, attempts to deliver very complex scientific and detailed ideas about the human mind in a simplified way. The main idea of the book is that the human brain runs over 2 systems. System 1 “the automatic” is the intuitive and fast whereas system 2 is the slow thinker. These 2 systems are supposed to assist us with living this life , however they might cause us some problems because sometimes we need system 2 to do the work and system 1 is the one taking a decision. Here is an example, what is 2+2? Now what is 17x24? Well the answer to the first question is executed by system 1 whereas the second is by system 2.“System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgements you make.”When the answer is easy, we rarely double check with system 2. Here is a mind puzzling example he gives: (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.How much does the ball cost? _____ cents System 1 would immediately say 0.1, whereas the true answer is 0.05 (Do it on a paper). As a result, the quick fast system 1 might take shortcuts that are wrong while making a decision. There are several examples and at each I was amazed. Kahneman repeatedly labels system 2 as “lazy”: “We don’t want to think rigorously about something” that’s why most of the decisions are rather chosen easily and based on hunch or impression.The book is long 500 pages so I will just pinpoint a few ideas worth sharing: -	Avaliability Heuristic: We tend to make our choices based on the data available to us. People tend to highlight importance on easily retrieved data from memory. Kahneman indicates that most readilty available data is from memory. -	Priming: priming is also about what information we have before making a decision. For example, if you recently heard the word EAT, you are more likely to solve the word fragment SO_P by SOUP. But if you heard the word WASH, you’re most likely going to say SOAP. Priming occurs in system 1. -	Cognitive Ease: it is a cause and consequence of a pleasant feeling. A happy mood loosens the control of system2 over performance, when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. -	The halo effect: our tendency to judge a person or thing as good or bad even on things we haven’t obsereved. -	WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is.What I loved about the book is that it is more evidence of the simplicity of our brains (or stupidity) and how easily manipulated and fragile they are. We are far less rational than we think we are. Kahneman shows us all that through examples of simple everyday decisions. The book definietley doesn’t flow and it took me about 6 months to finish, sipping it and digesting it slowly. Don’t get me wrong, the style is simple but the content is heavy that you really would feel the need to put it down and ponder on the thought. The book changes your perception immediately. It made me question my previously made decisions, my feelings, my knowledge and definitely made me think more when I have system 1 kicking in for easily reachable answers. I recommend this book as a must read, but in case 500 pages is too much for you, read the chapters of “Overconfidence”, “Choices” and “Two Selves”. "
262,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,4,"If you are interested in learning more about how the brain works, which you should be, you need to read this book. This book treats with a fair amount of academic rigor the subjects that ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell addresses with anecdotes. This book covers research that Kahneman conducted over his career, including research which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. This book will destroy much of your confidence in your own cognitive functioning and decision-making processes, then give you the tools you need to step back and rebuild those processes in a more rational way. This takes deliberate effort, as you will see in this book if you are not already familiar with the various cognitive biases and heuristics our minds employ to interpret the vast stream of incoming data.Kahneman begins by describing two systems of cognitive function - System 1, which operates quickly, emotionally, and subconsciously, and System 2, which operates slowly, consciously, and logically. The rest of the book is written within the framework of these two systems.Next, Kahneman describes a series of cognitive biases and heuristics that are responsible for our frequent struggles to think rationally and logically. Many of these involve our minds' failures to accurately apply statistical thinking to decision-making, and they account for many of our ""snap judgments"" which turn out to be baseless and false. We are afflicted by MANY cognitive biases, and this book is not exhaustive, but it does a great job of describing and discussing the several that it presents. If you are interested in a quick, easy overview of a broader range of these cognitive biases, check out You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney. This book is by no means academically rigorous as Kahneman's book is, but provides a much broader overview of these errors in our thought processes.Kahneman goes on to discuss Prospect Theory (for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics) in the context of these two systems. He delves a bit into behavioral economics and explains how and why humans differ in their behavior from the perfectly rational ""Econ"" that is the subject of study in the field of Economics. He also discusses how to avoid some of the shortcomings of our fast, subconscious thought processes in our day-to-day lives.Finally, Kahneman takes the two-system model and expands it into a ""two-self"" model with an ""experiential self"" and a ""remembered self."" He discusses these two selves in the context of multiple experiments he conducted to try to study happiness and comes to a rather astonishing conclusion about the impacts of duration and intensity of unpleasant events on perceived unpleasantness. The bottom line: we all (ostensibly) have brains, and we all struggle (to vastly varying degrees) on a day to day basis to make good decisions, to think logically and rationally, and to maximize our own happiness. If you want to get better at doing these things, read this book."

I enjoyed it just as much as I had enjoyed Rolf Dobelli's The Art of Thinking Clearly which I reference often when it comes to fallacies. Kahneman's metaphorical division of the mental life into two systems, fast and slow, makes the book quite interesting no matter how much one has read about the brain, mind, cognition and emotions. The goa, as Kahneman puts it, is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. Memory, he writes is and attribute of System 1, while deliberate checking and search are characteristics of System 2. Hence: ""Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.""My favorite quote from the book, perhaps because it is relevant to the current global, socio-political issues is this: ""A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."""

The book is excellent in all aspects and tries to explain our biases and natural tendancies towards specific acts.

268,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,5,"This is quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read. Not because the author attempts to make it that way, but just because of the implications. I shelved in under horror somewhat in jest, but I really do think that the book is Lovecraftian--not in the tentacles and unpronounceable names sense, but in the cosmic horror and nihilism sense:The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of CthulhuThat ""inability to correlate its contents"" is really what Thinking, Fast and Slow is about.Let me explain. The main thesis of the book is that decision making and evaluation of the world can primarily be sorted into two broad processes in the mind, which Kahneman calls ""System 1"" and ""System 2."" System 1 is intuitive, uses heuristics to evaluate information, is effortless, only deals with current information (WYSIATI, or ""What You See Is All There Is""), constructs causal narratives, and fast. System 2 is contemplative, judges based on logic, requires effort to engage, separates events properly, and is slow. Hence the book's title.Note that these terms don't refer to any single identifiable brain structure or thought process. They're simply ways of categorizing how the brain works.After a brief explanation of these systems, the rest of the book is a gigantic litany of all the ways in which humans are, essentially, buffeted by subconscious processes over which they have no control. And I use that phrase deliberately, because there are multiple examples of psychologists, including Kahneman himself, falling victim to the cognitive disortions depicted therein, even when they know about them and even directly after having exactly what they did wrong explained to them.The main reason for that is that thinking is hard. Most of the time, System 1 is good enough, especially for our savannah-dwelling hominid ancestors, and System 2 requires much more energy than relying on System 1, so we're reluctant to engage in it unless absolutely necessary and take basically every opportunity to switch back to System 1.So, here are some examples:The Halo Effect: How one's judgement of a person's actions is influenced by their overall character. If you like your boss, you're likely to interpret their sticking to a plan in the face of adversity as being even-tempered, cautious, persistent, and thoughtful. If you don't like them, you're likely to view the exact same actions as rigid, stubborn, and tyrannical. Another example is how more attractive people tend to be thought of as kinder or more intelligent than less attractive people even in the absence of evidence.Priming: Priming is changing estimates or judgements based on information that may not have anything to do with the judgement. The major example in the book is a wheel of fortune rigged to stop at either 10 or 65, and after spinning it, participants would be asked how many African countries are members of the U.N. The average answer for people who got a 10 was 25, and the average for people who got a 65 was 45. More disturbingly, judges with an average of fifteen years' experience rolled weighted dice designed to get either 3 or 9 before evaluating cases to determine sentencing. If the dice got 3, the average sentence was 5 months. If it was 9, it was 8 months.Endowment Effect: Owning something is better than not owning it, and getting it is better than giving it away. One example given is a oenophile who refuses to buy wine at more than $30 and refuses to sell it at more than $100. According to economic theory, that makes no sense. Well, it does--once bought, it has additional value since now it's owned, and owning something is more powerful than not owning it. Though it is pointed out that this doesn't tend to apply to cash or to retailers and their stock, since their possessors view them only as means to an end and not owned goods in and of themselves.Hindsight Bias: This is the tendency to see events that have already happened as being inevitable, even if they were unpredictable beforehand, and more generally as a tendency to edit memories in response to newly-provided information. This often shows up in accidents, where people suffer blame far out of proportion to the probability of the accident, and is especially damaging in trials, where juries will tend to assume that the probabilities of events are higher than they actually were. That also leads decision-makers to spend a large amount of resources on materials and policies to deflect blame, even if it makes things objectively worse (zero-tolerance policies at schools, for example)Regression to the Mean: Great successes tend to be followed by disappointing performance and dismal failure tends to be followed by improvement simply because over time, there are more incidents closer to the average than not. This can cause undue suffering, as in the example given of Israeli pilots. The instructor mentions the criticism is better than praise, because pilots tend to improve after they're criticized and get worse after they're praised. However, this isn't causal, it's just regression to the mean, and considering other research on praise vs. criticism, it's actively detrimental.Risk Aversion: People rate losses as worse than gains, and evaluate chances based not on their probability, but as weighted by whether it's a gain or loss. Furthermore, they tend to prefer certainty on gains, but will seek out risk over certainty for losses. As an example, consider two offers: in one, you can take $250 for sure or have a 30% chance to get $1000 and a 70% chance to get nothing, and in the other you can lose $700 for sure or have a 75% chance to lose $750 and a 25% chance to lose nothing. Most people will take the $250 on the first example and risk the gamble in the second, even though a strict accounting of probability would indicate it should be the other way around.Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect: Experiences are not evaluated in memory objectively. Instead, only two things tend to be considered--the highest (or lowest) single point, and the condition at the end. How long the experience lasted doesn't matter at all. In one example, an experimenter mentioned a certain women who had died of cancer at age 30 or age 60 after having lived a happy life. People were asked to evaluate her life, and the 30-year and 60-year groups generally rated it the same quality even though one was twice as long. However, when she lived 35 years or 65 years, and the last 5 years were not as happy as the preceding years, her quality of life was rated lower than the 30- or 60-year versions even though the total time was longer. These biases are also why people in new relationships after an acrimonious breakup tend to assume their new relationship is orders of magnitude better than their previous one, even if they had many happy years together before its end, simply because it ended badly.Cognitive Energy: Engaging System 2 takes effort, literally, and we try to avoid it when we don't want to. Furthermore, we're worse at it when depleted of energy. In one highly depressing example, a group of judges evaluating parole cases were studied, and it was found that the probability of them granting parole was directly proportional to how long it had been since they last ate. When they started for the day, the rate was 65% of cases granted parole, but right before lunch it was almost 0. That means that how hungry the judge was has a higher influence on parole applications than the merits of the case!WYSIATI: System 1 doesn't take any information into account other than what is directly in front of it, even if using System 2 makes it obvious that that information is highly relevant. One example is dolphins vs. orphans. The experimenter asked a group of people how much money they would donate to charity in two separate cases--saving dolphins and saving orphans. If the examples were given singly, then the average amount given to dolphins was almost three times the amount given to orphans. If they were given together, though, then the amount given to orphans beat the amount given to dolphins because now there was a new piece of information--orphans are human, dolphins are not--that previously was ignored because even though it was highly relevant, it wasn't part of the problem presented.Feminist Bank Teller: I don't remember the formal name for this one either, but it's an error of categorization. People were presented with a description of a person, including that she was outspoken, active in women's rights organizations, brash, etc., and then asked what careers she was likely to join. ""Feminist bank teller"" was weighted higher than ""bank teller"" both on lists where they appeared singly and when they appeared together, even though all feminist bank tellers are also bank tellers and therefore bank teller must be higher probability. A similar problem can be seen with coin flips. Most people will rate THHHTH as a more likely sequence than THHH, even though the first sequence is simply the second one with extra tosses added and therefore can only be less likely.There are literally dozens of other examples I haven't mentioned, because the review simply doesn't have enough space and anyway, there's already a book (and reams of psychology research) about it. And you should read it. Everyone should read it. Everyone should know about what is going on in their mind without their knowledge.Though one warning: Thinking, Fast and Slow is extremely dense. As another review mentions, it's not always clear whether he's writing this book for psychologists or a lay audience, and some parts may require several read-throughs to figure out what Kahneman is saying and the implications thereof.Then again, maybe that's just because System 2 is lazy and dumping things onto System 1.It's not automatically as horrible as I make it out. Kahneman specifically emphasizes that our minds are set up this way because the vast majority of the time, it's good enough to function and survive. To me, though, this really is Lovecraftian--in Lovecraft's stories it was alien races and sleeping deities manipulating humanity without humanity's knowledge, and here it's the unconscious processes in our own mind. I value rationality very highly and do my best to try to be rational, but this book makes a very good case that rationality is literally impossible except in certain specific cases, and it can't be sustained since System 2 takes energy, and the more energy you use, the more likely System 2 is to give up and dump everything back on System 1 even if you know about all of these cognitive errors.So, you might find this book horribly depressing, like I did, or you may find it inspiring, like someone else I know, who said that knowing about all the natural errors in human cognition is the first step in developing a way to fix them. But either way, you should read it, because there's little that's more important to understand than the workings of your own mind."
269,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446434-hundeschlitten,2,"There are some interesting ideas here, but why do so many of these left-brain science types insist on writing their own books? Like a lot of generalized overviews written by some expert in his or her field, Daniel Kahneman's survey of the current ideas surrounding behavioral economics was a real chore to slog through at times. The book is broken into five sections and, at least to me, things really didn't start getting interesting until section three. In the first two sections, there are just too many experiments Kahneman felt the need to summarize, almost all demonstrating some way in which our decision making is less than entirely efficient. At times, I felt like I was plodding across the written equivalent of the Oregon Trail, with no end in sight. In Part Three, Kahneman begins to use these experiments to dismantle the concepts of the Chicago school of economics, which is based on the concept that we are all rational actors. But then Kahneman accepts the theory of ""highly efficient markets"" as a given, which makes no sense if their participants aren't being rational. So even here, Kahneman loses me. But at least he's being topical.Part Four features more experiments, most of which attempt to find ways in which you can trick otherwise intelligent people into making non-sensible decisions.Part Five is the most intellectually interesting part of the book, as Kahneman posits an experiencing self and a remembering self, and what this implies about how we make decisions. So unless you read very quickly, my advice is to begin at page 199, and feel free to skim some of the chapters (which are numerous but mercifully short) until you get to the final section on the two selves, which begins on page 377.

As I read it, page after page was covered in notes, 'yes' 'no' 'really?' 'but'....What Kahneman discusses in this book is something we've all known in a less rigorous way, perhaps - the intuitive and the analytical paths to decision making and action.Two SystemsPsychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the two modes of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind, System 1 and System 2.System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.The labels of System 1 and System 2 are widely used in psychology, but I go further than most in this book, which you can read as a psychodrama with two characters.Surely you chess and bridge players are already sitting up and paying attention. We all know about that psychodrama. He continues:When we think if ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book. I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 general surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1. You will be invited to think of the two systems as agents with their individual abilities, limitations, and functions.Of course this hasn't been written with game players in mind, and you may, like me, find yourself disagreeing with some of the ideas here. For a start, System 1 is based on the infinite hard work of System 2. As far as playing games go, you aren't born with S1, it grows and improves because of S2. However, it is definitely food for thought and may help clarify aspects of how you are thinking and how you might address issues.Educational and sometimes astonishing when it comes to how bad we humans are at dealing with data.

271,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859963-suhrob,5,"In ""Thinking, fast and slow"" the Nobel laureate Danny Kahneman summarizes his life long work mostly done with his collegue (and Nobel corecipient) Amos Tversky in the field of cognitive psychology and decision making.There has been an outcrop of books on this topic in the recent years (Ariely and Lehrer being the bigger names) and there is a significant overlap with similar books. However, for the seriously interested I'd recommend to start here. This is the original reference, the user manual for your brain.The scope of the book is large but Kahneman tries to make the topics more accessible by anthropomorphising the two cognitive ""systems"" in interplay in human decision making (though giving them the non descript names ""1"" and ""2""). The chapters end with examples (""soundbites"") where the introduced concepts are used in real life settings. This attempt at accessibility is, in my opinion, undermined by the 400 page tome which might be too intimidating to some. But I can understand the tension between trying to be influential and trying to summarize a whole field and life long work.Apart from that, the book is very lean, you won't find any cutesy stories or participatory journalism. Just concept after concept and the relevant research. But don't let that discourage you - the book is well written and structured. I consider the lack of fluff a big plus.Kahneman is skeptical that even learning about all these cognitive biases can make a change on individual level, but hopes something can be done on institutional level. The whole thing is a bit saddening. We are really running on a to me still very impressive, but at the same time, very flawed system. The sheer scope how irrelevant factors influence our decision making even on highest levels is frightening.I am generally very optimistic about the future of humanity and would love to be around to see where it goes, but if we get there, if we are ever to make it, it will be only with a lots of luck.An essential book."

275,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Kahneman divides the way we think into two “systems”. These are not actual entities, but constructs that represent distinct modes of thought. System 1 is our intuitive sense covering ideas and feelings that just pop into our heads without effort. System 2 is our reasoning, rational sense that we use when we deliberately think things through. He offers many different scenarios that determine whether System 1 or System 2 is engaged. Realizing that this determination itself is often automatic can leave you feeling a little less in control. Kahneman shows us how many ways our thinking can go off track. Our immediate thoughts occur by association, resemblance to the familiar or because they represent our expectations. We jump to conclusions because it is the easiest thing to do. Our minds have an inherent laziness. We often stick with the first thought that comes to mind even though the situation calls for engaging System 2. If a question is just too hard for System 1, System 1 will make it simpler so we can forgo the mental work of engaging System 2.`Even when System 2 does engage, System 1 can subvert it without us being aware. Priming is the effect of being influenced by prior unrelated information. For example, Kahneman points to experiments that show just hearing something about money makes our subsequent behavior more self-centered. Anchoring refers to hearing or seeing a fact that sets a beginning point for evaluation of a subsequent problem. Just putting a number in the mind can make it a starting point for thinking about anything that comes next. Setting targets unrealistically high or low is used by negotiators to make their real goals seem more reasonable. Representativeness is about using stereotypes or imputing one quality from another similar to the halo effect. The halo effect occurs when current opinions often formed by System 1 shape subsequent judgements even if they are about something completely unrelated. For example if you find someone personable you are more likely to think they are also generous. Availability refers to anything that we hear repeatedly, which will be quickly recalled and used by System 1. And of course any judgement, snap or not, is subject to our emotions and mood. Preceding unrelated events may change the decisions we make. While System 1 operates at the WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) level ignoring information not immediately at hand, it can add things that are not there. It imputes motive and intent. It postulates connections between events. When System 1 is challenged by limited information it fills in the blanks. This may be very useful in some situations, but it also leads to unsupported assumptions and conspiracy theories.Most people tend to overconfidence in their judgement. We think we know more than we do. We underestimate randomness and put too much faith in patterns that are often temporary or simply imagined. We ignore baselines of activity and are overly influenced by recent events even though reversion to the mean is typically a better predictor of future outcomes. Intuition can be helpful but only when used by experts in fields where statistically significant correlations exist. Kahneman challenges conventional economic theory that assumes people are rational when they buy or sell. He identifies many influences that make economic decisions subjective. Key is loss aversion vs. gain. Losses are more psychologically painful and thus fear of them overweight decisions to avoid them. Context is very important. The significance of the amount to your personal situation matters. Just owning something increases its value to the owner. Framing is important. The language describing a transaction will invoke a System 1 response. Preceding transactions alter perception of the value of subsequent ones. Kahneman gives many more examples and decimates the notion of the rational consumer.Another fascinating concept concerns how we view our lives. Are we the experienced self or the remembered self? The experienced self consists of our feelings as we lived them, the other as they are remembered. The two are different. A twenty year marriage that was happy for 19 out of twenty years is very positive for the experienced self, but if the marriage ended in a bitter divorce it might all be remembered very negatively. A more mundane example is choosing a vacation. Do you choose a familiar place you know you like or a more stressful one that will create memories? The way we remember our lives does not match the way we lived them.Clearly this is a book to shake up your sense of self, and if you are like me you will enjoy the challenge. It also helps us to understand others and our relationships, although Kahneman doesn’t specifically target that aspect. I couldn’t keep from thinking of how System 1 and System 2 applied to people’s thinking in this year’s presidential election. Kahneman’s presentation is clear even for something as tricky as Bayesian analysis. My notes above cover only a small sample of the ideas in the book. I think most readers will find something to appreciate. Highly recommended. "
276,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,2,"Daniel Kahneman is a psychology professor at Princeton University who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on decision making. His book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is a journey through his theories with a primary focus on the business world and its failure to adequately apply statistical information to its predictive practices. What you should know, you ambitious soul, prior to picking up this work, is that the man is going to harsh your buzz and take great evil joy in doing it.Professor Kahneman suggests there are two systems in operation when we think. System One is quick, intuition-based and emotional. System Two is more deliberately analytical. Most decisions are made by System One because, according to Kahneman, System Two is a lazy goose and prefers not to exert the effort. That laziness is the reason we put our (misguided) faith in instinct, skill, confidence, expertise, personal experience and our own judgment when, really, we should confine ourselves to consulting the relevant available statistics. Just look at the facts, Jack. Stop indulging in the fantasy that you properly understand the past or can in any way predict the future. Forget what you think you know. You don't. You can't. And Kahneman, through chapters and chapters of interactive exercise and discourse, goes a long way toward proving this.Lots of people who know far more than I do about behavioral economics like this book and are five-star impressed by the material. Alas, I'm a visceral kid, so my considerations here are going to be a little off the statistical beaten path. For instance, Kahneman relays a story about a speaking engagement he once had with a group of investment advisers. Given a spreadsheet conveying the choices made by twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers over the course of eight consecutive years, the professor performs his calculations and proves to the top executives that financial expertise played no part in the outcome of those investments. Predictive acumen was absent. To quote: ""The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill."" Kahneman continues:The next morning we reported the findings to the advisers, and their response was equally bland. Their own experience of exercising careful judgment on complex problems was far more compelling to them than an obscure statistical fact. When we were done, one of the executives I had dined with the previous evening drove me to the airport. He told me, with a trace of defensiveness, ""I have done very well for the firm and no one can take that away from me."" I smiled and said nothing. But I thought, ""Well, I took it away from you this morning. If your success was due mostly to chance, how much credit are you entitled to take from it?""Now this interests me, this trollish glee. It interests and informs me. It also calls to mind several recent studies done in the area of clinical depression. Results are beginning to emerge to suggest those who suffer from this dark and pernicious despair may actually have a better grip on reality than those who don't. The depressed may indeed be seeing the world more clearly than the rest, and this may be why they're depressed - which brings to light the possibly essential role of denial in our lives. What we are able to repress on a daily basis - the inevitability of death, loss, sickness, natural and unnatural disaster; the random and entirely arbitrary nature of the universe; the cruelty of man; the unfairness of society, the powerlessness of the individual to effect measurable change - may indeed preserve our psychic well-being. Ignorance may not merely be bliss, it may be what's keeping us sane.Which is not to say, of course, that we shouldn't keep exploring and investigating and uncovering new truths. And it's not to say we should ignore the progress being made in all fields of endeavor. What draws my attention here is Kahneman's System One conveyance of his information - which seems pat, hubristic and ill-considered to me. He may have come up with certain statistical realities that illuminate the folly of our confidence in our own decision-making capacities. He may be correct in characterizing our faith in ourselves as ""delusional optimism."" But he doesn't go the extra mile of engaging the System Two segment of his brain to analyze the function such ""blind"" self-assurance may serve in regard to psychic health - a knowledge which sets up the much more intriguing question of whether it's more important to be right in the world, or right with it.Hey, we're all human. And, as it turns out, Kahneman's more human than most. But seriously, Professor, seriously...I could have done without that very high horse."
277,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow is an extremely well researched book - in fact painstakingly so. The book starts with a basic premise: we think fast at times based on intuition, and slow where more analysis is required. After discussing the concept in fair detail, the book goes on to list with excellent examples thinking biases especially with fast thinking. The examples are a mix of basic math, every day experiences, economic theory and others. There are also towards the end examples of satisfaction with life. This is a book which needs to be read slowly though and is a very serious read - it is very detailed in it's treatment."
278,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12520565-richard,2,"Kahneman is a brilliant thinker who's small experiments cracked the foundations of neo-classical/rational choice theory. His collections like Choices, Values and Frames are terrific reading, full of extraordinarily disorienting observations of actual human behavior. That said, this book was a bit of a disappointment. In this book, Kahneman weaves together a series of ideas based on his experiments and the experiments of like-minded researchers, and the effect is underwhelming. Gone is the careful exploration of small twists in human behavior, replaced with broad, rolling declarations that are only weakly supported by the data. For most of the experiments he cites, he fails to talk about the power of the findings (were participants 40% more likely to do something when framed a certain way? Or 4% more likely? Or 400%?). Sure, this is a book for a wider audience than his journal articles or academic collections, but I found that the dumbing down went too far. Too bad. The basic research that made Kahneman a star is fabulous. Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice is a great example - a review of experiments involving no more than some college students and coffee mugs, with counterintuitive findings about loss and market prices. Kahneman is at his best when he lets the reader figure out the implications of his stunning findings.Also, his dual process theory of thought - System 1 and System 2 - seems the less powerful of two competing views of human reason. A skeptic might ask what evidence is there that System 2 exists at all. System 2 certainly seems to be no less vulnerable to confirmation bias than System 1. The Mercier and Sperber formulation on the function of human reason just fits better with evolutionary models. Of course, that's probably just my confirmation bias kicking in."
279,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,3,"This is a comment on a specific element of the book, and not a review of the whole work. If there is something I truly HATE is the self-importance of “behavioral experiments” or “psychological tests” applied to the behavior of groups of people. You know, for example when a test group is asked to press a button under certain conditions, or state their feelings while watching some images, etc. I don’t have any doubts: I just think they are bullshit, pure and simple. And psychology is NOT a science. I wouldn’t have gone to the lengths of researching this further, but on page 57 the authors come up with the following ridiculous display of hubris :  “The results of these experiments are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THESE STUDIES ARE TRUE.” Haha! Prompted by this rather odd, childish statement, I decided to do a little research of my own, and .... it turns out that only 2 years ago a thorough study (now become very famous in the field) proved that:1) the specific experiment quoted in this book called “ego depletion” is complete bunk. 2) unsurprisingly, the VAST MAJORITY of these experiments have a very serious “reproducibility problem”. Hence, they cannot be considered “science”, or anything remotely leading us to “undeniably true conclusions”. The principles underlying the experiments are true enough, but not because they are proved by the experiments. It’s because they are “elegantly presented common sense”. Here is an article about the study. Enjoy. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_..."
280,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4628362-harry-lane,4,"This is a hard book. Not because the author is hard to read; on the contrary, he is clear, lucid and compelling. He uses a multitude of examples and cases to illustrate the points he makes. The difficulty is rather in us, the readers. Kahneman's thesis, abundantly supported, is that all of us operate on two levels. Anyone who is at all familiar with psychology and research into the brain knows about our ""lizard brain."" Kahneman shows how this part of our makeup operates at a level far beyond the fight or flight response, affecting our everyday lives in ways that we are totally unaware of. More than that, it affects our reasoning processes in ways that I never imagined. And though one can peruse the text easily enough, it is very, very difficult to make the application to one's own thought processes. Kahneman makes it plain that we could all benefit from a greater degree of self-awareness and disciplined thinking that takes into account these unconscious influences, but actually applying that is hard. That said, his book explains a lot about how easily we are manipulated, and why we so often draw the wrong conclusions from our experience. He also accounts for ""experts"" who are so often wrong and why the future is so unpredictable."
281,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Do you remember the feeling when your teacher asked you to read some pages from your textbook at home? You might have started off reading very carefully to get the point of every sentence, but as your reading progressed you got more and more bored, and finally you were flying your eyes over the last pages.That was the case with this book - we had to read it for our psychology class. Our teacher said it is a fascinating book and some other people I know had kind words to say about it as well; thus, I had high hopes for the book.I found the book tremendously tedious. There is too much text for all the points the author makes. Most of the time, I didn't even delve into the problem questions, which used way too much mathematical intuition.Now I understand why teachers don't want us to use 'you' form in essays. I couldn't stand his use of 'you' forms as if he thought he could read our minds. Most of the things he talked about were obvious anyway."

Hey, at least I was reading Kahneman before he won that Nobel Prize, before he got really popular. But I have to admit I never actually finished his Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases — it was due back at the library when I was only halfway through. That is a slow, engrossing grind of an academic tome, though.All the reviews have been glowing. Kahneman is golden, of course — he's ascended into the pantheon of the intelligentsia's demigods. The first one I read was from The Economist, then there was the one from the New York Times, and then I caught the one in The Wilson Quarterly, but what finally made really this the zeitgeist was when I came across a review in the fluffy “Paper” magazine (I was sitting in a coffeeshop waiting for some friends to finish a boardgame and picked up a free copy. More pop culture snuck into my brain in that twenty minutes than I permitted during the balance of 2011.)May 8th 2012 Update: The Economist chimes in with an aside: Foreign languages and thinking: Oprima dos for better cognition, in which they report on evidence that some of our cognitive flaws don't seem to interfere when we ponder the decision in a non-native language."

Thinking Fast and Slow
. It's so chock full of fantastic ideas, insights, and information that I'm afraid even trying to comment on it will make me look like a fool.Let me just say, then, that Thinking Fast and Slow is absolutely fascinating, a book worth reading and rereading, especially if you're of the self-improvement, self-examining type. Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner for his work in Behavioral Economics has a fascinating mind, and I felt like I had a front-row seat to one of the most incredible lectures about decision making, heuristics, and judgment that had ever been given.And here's where I start to worry about sounding like a fool: this just isn't my field of expertise. Sure, I love learning and I consider myself to be, in many respects, an autodidact. But Thinking Fast and Slow is, if I'm not mistaken, a summary of all of Kahneman's work from the last fifty years (or more?). It's gobstoppingly dense with studies Kahneman and his fellow researchers have devised to examine who people think, and I quell the thought of trying to comment on it.But I will gladly comment about it. Thinking Fast and Slow has been, over the weeks that I've been reading it, easily the book I've recommended most, and I admit having to suppress some excitement when someone tells me that they've ordered the book from Amazon. Even if you don't like economics, or maybe especially if you don't like economics, Kahneman's research is accessible to anyone with even a modicum of interest in society, decision-making, or how we think and exercise judgment. Rather than describe the world in terms of complex equations and graphs--though there are certainly a lot of graphs--Kahneman seems to be constantly devising thought experiments to understand how and why people act in certain situations. What a life it must be to be Kahneman, self-tasked with identifying the 'how' and 'why' of any particular decision, whether it is discerning who the best candidates are for officer training from among a cadre of soldiers during field exercises, or figuring out how to redesign the food pyramid to be a food pie, there seems to be no end of topics or situations where behavioral economics can be applied with some revelatory success.One part of especial interest to me was the section, near the end, when Kahneman begins to describe memory, pain, and suffering. If I understand right, Kahneman makes the point that research shows that it isn't the measurement of pleasure, happiness, or well-being over the duration of an event--such as a surgery, marriage, or vacation--that matters so much as how the event ends that we remember. Even if the event was, for the most part, a wonderful or positive experience we still remember the event based on how it ends. Shakespeare might put this as ""All's well that ends well."" For me, it's a paradigm-shifting insight about the importance not only of getting things right but also ending things right. How we remember things is, essentially, flawed, and what we are left with in memory often conflicts with what the experience was as a whole.Anyway, 
Thinking Fast and Slow 
is a great book. Prospect theory, framing, reference points, loss versus gain, and more are all raised and addressed and explored, and I am sure I will return to it again soon. I think I probably read it far too quickly, too eager to absorb concepts, and I feel there's more here to understand and examine."
284,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,2,"Have started skipping pages and chapters, seeking the really intriguing insights, which seem, most often, to be research other than that of Dr. Kahneman. Dr. Kahneman can devote most of a chapter to how he saved standardized tests for the Israeli military in the 1960´s. I think modesty is a big problem for him.Also, while it´s hard to imagine an academic community once utterly in thrall of perfect rationality, game theory, etc., the fact that mankind is not rational by rigid standards of logic now feels like a truism, and listing traps in statistical judgment that students fall into doesn´t make working rationality any more or less true. I sense that Dr. Kahneman also knows this.Like a book about the human brain I was picking through at roughly the same time, this is really a series of short papers written over quite a long time. It's likely that they contradict each other and somehow convey the illusion of complexity in the process.Is this the place to talk about problems with statistics as a science? Because Dr. Kahneman loves statistics, and wherever people fail at statitistics, Dr. Kahneman considers them irrational. This is self-serving, because he takes pains to point out that writers of statistics textbooks make basic statistical errors. He himself says he forgets to use large enough samples in studies sometimes.I attended a university which dedicated entire courses to the soft science of statistical failure, and then required I take those courses. One absolutely soporific professor Dr. Kahneman praises a great deal stood in front of my class and ""proved"" that statistically there is no reason to vote. Another ""proved"" that attacking Iraq was George Bush's only option in the Gulf War.Dr. Kahneman likes to say that a few simple measures are better than expert opinion. This is self-serving again, because results are measured by the same simple metrics. So, for example, experts are asked to predict the likelihood of a very limited number of distinctly defined options, multiple choice style. Or, in an example such as that of predicting the market for wine, the same growing conditions which are used to grade the quality of wine are used to predict its market value in the growing season. What a shock.This review is in danger of becoming as diffuse and confusing as the book. As another review points out, the book is fast and loose with statistics itself and essentially plays all sides of the field at once. I did browse some of the academic papers in the appendix and they weren't remarkable more consistent. It would be interesting to see the peer review process for those papers.Without having experienced the stifling milieu of absolute rationality in social sciences, I imagine we should be grateful for the comparative freedom Dr. Kahneman gave some students in the 50s. Still, per my update, the concluding pages of the book nearly sound like fascism. If statistics is the magical order of the universe, only to be discovered and worshipped by the select elite, well, the Dr. tells us that governments and companies, which are magically immune from (statistical) failures should be doing all of our thinking for us."
285,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"I've long wondered about the ""rational man"" of economic theory and have wondered if there was some kind of drug I could take that would enable me to be that person. And what did it mean that I--fully aware of my emotion-based spending (or, more likely, not spending) decisions--seemed, as a Prius owner, to be much more rational than the majority of American car buyers with their acceptance of insanely low mpg's?Having read this book, I now believe that the rational man of economic theory needs to be read out of the human race. (S)he has no more validity than the forecasting models that failed to predict the crash of 2008. For all practical purposes, as this book shows, we make judgments with our emotions *first*--and don't call on rationality unless we have to. Perhaps this is why Kahneman calls it System 1 (our ""just the facts ma'am"" side is System 2). Real thinking is hard work, and we are all slackers. We indulge in halo effects, we want to make correlations causative, we're easily influenced by extraneous sensory factors--the list of reason-dodging practices is an extensive one for which this book serves as a catalog.I spend a lot of time in board meetings as a result of my job. Even though the meetings aren't as dysfunctional as the ones in Dilbert, nonetheless I'm often disturbed by the pronounced unevenness of influence: those who express their opinions most often are the most influential; others keep their opinions to themselves until the final vote and then go along. I was delighted, then, when I saw this sentence: ""The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them."" Kahneman suggests a simple solution, which is simply to have everyone write down, before a meeting, a ""very brief summary of their position.""I might not be able to get this rule adopted. But if others fail to see its obvious wisdom, you can bet they will all be Hummer drivers."

In 2011 he published the best-seller, ""Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow"", a summary of his lifetimes work.DK has proved that our thinking patterns aren't half as smart as we might like to think they are. Our emotions like to think fast; in other words, jump to conclusions based on few facts and little analysis, leading to a belief that may well be largely irrational. Our intellect likes to think slowly, sifting facts, weighing judgements, possibly deciding the evidence is insufficient to reach any conclusion."
291,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"I don’t know how this book tastes like, it felt like a long night of cheese and wine maybe; sober. I couldn’t write a review easily, it took me a while to read, to ponder and now to write.Why this book? I am fascinated by decision making science (it was the subject of my Master’s thesis) and I am always looking for behavioral economics books such as Ariely’s and Taleb’s. Truth is, I don’t think I’ve read a better book about decision making; it is simply a psychological masterpiece. Kahneman is brilliant. The author (who is a Nobel Prize winner), in this book, attempts to deliver very complex scientific and detailed ideas about the human mind in a simplified way. The main idea of the book is that the human brain runs over 2 systems. System 1 “the automatic” is the intuitive and fast whereas system 2 is the slow thinker. These 2 systems are supposed to assist us with living this life , however they might cause us some problems because sometimes we need system 2 to do the work and system 1 is the one taking a decision. Here is an example, what is 2+2? Now what is 17x24? Well the answer to the first question is executed by system 1 whereas the second is by system 2.“System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgements you make.”When the answer is easy, we rarely double check with system 2. Here is a mind puzzling example he gives: (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.How much does the ball cost? _____ cents System 1 would immediately say 0.1, whereas the true answer is 0.05 (Do it on a paper). As a result, the quick fast system 1 might take shortcuts that are wrong while making a decision. There are several examples and at each I was amazed. Kahneman repeatedly labels system 2 as “lazy”: “We don’t want to think rigorously about something” that’s why most of the decisions are rather chosen easily and based on hunch or impression.The book is long 500 pages so I will just pinpoint a few ideas worth sharing: -	Avaliability Heuristic: We tend to make our choices based on the data available to us. People tend to highlight importance on easily retrieved data from memory. Kahneman indicates that most readilty available data is from memory. -	Priming: priming is also about what information we have before making a decision. For example, if you recently heard the word EAT, you are more likely to solve the word fragment SO_P by SOUP. But if you heard the word WASH, you’re most likely going to say SOAP. Priming occurs in system 1. -	Cognitive Ease: it is a cause and consequence of a pleasant feeling. A happy mood loosens the control of system2 over performance, when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. -	The halo effect: our tendency to judge a person or thing as good or bad even on things we haven’t obsereved. -	WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is.What I loved about the book is that it is more evidence of the simplicity of our brains (or stupidity) and how easily manipulated and fragile they are. We are far less rational than we think we are. Kahneman shows us all that through examples of simple everyday decisions. The book definietley doesn’t flow and it took me about 6 months to finish, sipping it and digesting it slowly. Don’t get me wrong, the style is simple but the content is heavy that you really would feel the need to put it down and ponder on the thought. The book changes your perception immediately. It made me question my previously made decisions, my feelings, my knowledge and definitely made me think more when I have system 1 kicking in for easily reachable answers. I recommend this book as a must read, but in case 500 pages is too much for you, read the chapters of “Overconfidence”, “Choices” and “Two Selves”. "

This book treats with a fair amount of academic rigor the subjects that ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell addresses with anecdotes. This book covers research that Kahneman conducted over his career, including research which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. This book will destroy much of your confidence in your own cognitive functioning and decision-making processes, then give you the tools you need to step back and rebuild those processes in a more rational way. This takes deliberate effort, as you will see in this book if you are not already familiar with the various cognitive biases and heuristics our minds employ to interpret the vast stream of incoming data.Kahneman begins by describing two systems of cognitive function - System 1, which operates quickly, emotionally, and subconsciously, and System 2, which operates slowly, consciously, and logically. The rest of the book is written within the framework of these two systems.Next, Kahneman describes a series of cognitive biases and heuristics that are responsible for our frequent struggles to think rationally and logically. Many of these involve our minds' failures to accurately apply statistical thinking to decision-making, and they account for many of our ""snap judgments"" which turn out to be baseless and false. We are afflicted by MANY cognitive biases, and this book is not exhaustive, but it does a great job of describing and discussing the several that it presents. If you are interested in a quick, easy overview of a broader range of these cognitive biases, check out You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney. This book is by no means academically rigorous as Kahneman's book is, but provides a much broader overview of these errors in our thought processes.Kahneman goes on to discuss Prospect Theory (for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics) in the context of these two systems. He delves a bit into behavioral economics and explains how and why humans differ in their behavior from the perfectly rational ""Econ"" that is the subject of study in the field of Economics. He also discusses how to avoid some of the shortcomings of our fast, subconscious thought processes in our day-to-day lives.Finally, Kahneman takes the two-system model and expands it into a ""two-self"" model with an ""experiential self"" and a ""remembered self."" He discusses these two selves in the context of multiple experiments he conducted to try to study happiness and comes to a rather astonishing conclusion about the impacts of duration and intensity of unpleasant events on perceived unpleasantness. The bottom line: we all (ostensibly) have brains, and we all struggle (to vastly varying degrees) on a day to day basis to make good decisions, to think logically and rationally, and to maximize our own happiness. If you want to get better at doing these things, read this book."

Well, I decided to think slow and read this treacherous tedious demon of a book and there was nothing in this book I wouldn't have gotten from reading the first few chapters.The only circumstances I would recommend this book is if I was starting a book club and I wanted the book club to fail. I have PTSD from this book that makes me hesitant to read any sort of psychology/behavior book."

295,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37980042-andy,5,"Great read. I enjoyed it just as much as I had enjoyed Rolf Dobelli's The Art of Thinking Clearly which I reference often when it comes to fallacies. Kahneman's metaphorical division of the mental life into two systems, fast and slow, makes the book quite interesting no matter how much one has read about the brain, mind, cognition and emotions. The goa, as Kahneman puts it, is to introduce a language for thinking and talking about the mind. Memory, he writes is and attribute of System 1, while deliberate checking and search are characteristics of System 2. Hence: ""Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.""My favorite quote from the book, perhaps because it is relevant to the current global, socio-political issues is this: ""A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."""
296,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577651-said-almaskery,4,The only reason I didn't give the book a 5 star is its length. The book is excellent in all aspects and tries to explain our biases and natural tendancies towards specific acts. Unfortunately that such books might not be very useful unless you read it in certain context and try to apply some of its main observations of the humans thinking patterns. I was initially introduced to the book in a negotiations skills course in London business School. This was my context.

298,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,5,"This is quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read. Not because the author attempts to make it that way, but just because of the implications. I shelved in under horror somewhat in jest, but I really do think that the book is Lovecraftian--not in the tentacles and unpronounceable names sense, but in the cosmic horror and nihilism sense:The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.-H.P. Lovecraft, The Call of CthulhuThat ""inability to correlate its contents"" is really what Thinking, Fast and Slow is about.Let me explain. The main thesis of the book is that decision making and evaluation of the world can primarily be sorted into two broad processes in the mind, which Kahneman calls ""System 1"" and ""System 2."" System 1 is intuitive, uses heuristics to evaluate information, is effortless, only deals with current information (WYSIATI, or ""What You See Is All There Is""), constructs causal narratives, and fast. System 2 is contemplative, judges based on logic, requires effort to engage, separates events properly, and is slow. Hence the book's title.Note that these terms don't refer to any single identifiable brain structure or thought process. They're simply ways of categorizing how the brain works.After a brief explanation of these systems, the rest of the book is a gigantic litany of all the ways in which humans are, essentially, buffeted by subconscious processes over which they have no control. And I use that phrase deliberately, because there are multiple examples of psychologists, including Kahneman himself, falling victim to the cognitive disortions depicted therein, even when they know about them and even directly after having exactly what they did wrong explained to them.The main reason for that is that thinking is hard. Most of the time, System 1 is good enough, especially for our savannah-dwelling hominid ancestors, and System 2 requires much more energy than relying on System 1, so we're reluctant to engage in it unless absolutely necessary and take basically every opportunity to switch back to System 1.So, here are some examples:The Halo Effect: How one's judgement of a person's actions is influenced by their overall character. If you like your boss, you're likely to interpret their sticking to a plan in the face of adversity as being even-tempered, cautious, persistent, and thoughtful. If you don't like them, you're likely to view the exact same actions as rigid, stubborn, and tyrannical. Another example is how more attractive people tend to be thought of as kinder or more intelligent than less attractive people even in the absence of evidence.Priming: Priming is changing estimates or judgements based on information that may not have anything to do with the judgement. The major example in the book is a wheel of fortune rigged to stop at either 10 or 65, and after spinning it, participants would be asked how many African countries are members of the U.N. The average answer for people who got a 10 was 25, and the average for people who got a 65 was 45. More disturbingly, judges with an average of fifteen years' experience rolled weighted dice designed to get either 3 or 9 before evaluating cases to determine sentencing. If the dice got 3, the average sentence was 5 months. If it was 9, it was 8 months.Endowment Effect: Owning something is better than not owning it, and getting it is better than giving it away. One example given is a oenophile who refuses to buy wine at more than $30 and refuses to sell it at more than $100. According to economic theory, that makes no sense. Well, it does--once bought, it has additional value since now it's owned, and owning something is more powerful than not owning it. Though it is pointed out that this doesn't tend to apply to cash or to retailers and their stock, since their possessors view them only as means to an end and not owned goods in and of themselves.Hindsight Bias: This is the tendency to see events that have already happened as being inevitable, even if they were unpredictable beforehand, and more generally as a tendency to edit memories in response to newly-provided information. This often shows up in accidents, where people suffer blame far out of proportion to the probability of the accident, and is especially damaging in trials, where juries will tend to assume that the probabilities of events are higher than they actually were. That also leads decision-makers to spend a large amount of resources on materials and policies to deflect blame, even if it makes things objectively worse (zero-tolerance policies at schools, for example)Regression to the Mean: Great successes tend to be followed by disappointing performance and dismal failure tends to be followed by improvement simply because over time, there are more incidents closer to the average than not. This can cause undue suffering, as in the example given of Israeli pilots. The instructor mentions the criticism is better than praise, because pilots tend to improve after they're criticized and get worse after they're praised. However, this isn't causal, it's just regression to the mean, and considering other research on praise vs. criticism, it's actively detrimental.Risk Aversion: People rate losses as worse than gains, and evaluate chances based not on their probability, but as weighted by whether it's a gain or loss. Furthermore, they tend to prefer certainty on gains, but will seek out risk over certainty for losses. As an example, consider two offers: in one, you can take $250 for sure or have a 30% chance to get $1000 and a 70% chance to get nothing, and in the other you can lose $700 for sure or have a 75% chance to lose $750 and a 25% chance to lose nothing. Most people will take the $250 on the first example and risk the gamble in the second, even though a strict accounting of probability would indicate it should be the other way around.Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect: Experiences are not evaluated in memory objectively. Instead, only two things tend to be considered--the highest (or lowest) single point, and the condition at the end. How long the experience lasted doesn't matter at all. In one example, an experimenter mentioned a certain women who had died of cancer at age 30 or age 60 after having lived a happy life. People were asked to evaluate her life, and the 30-year and 60-year groups generally rated it the same quality even though one was twice as long. However, when she lived 35 years or 65 years, and the last 5 years were not as happy as the preceding years, her quality of life was rated lower than the 30- or 60-year versions even though the total time was longer. These biases are also why people in new relationships after an acrimonious breakup tend to assume their new relationship is orders of magnitude better than their previous one, even if they had many happy years together before its end, simply because it ended badly.Cognitive Energy: Engaging System 2 takes effort, literally, and we try to avoid it when we don't want to. Furthermore, we're worse at it when depleted of energy. In one highly depressing example, a group of judges evaluating parole cases were studied, and it was found that the probability of them granting parole was directly proportional to how long it had been since they last ate. When they started for the day, the rate was 65% of cases granted parole, but right before lunch it was almost 0. That means that how hungry the judge was has a higher influence on parole applications than the merits of the case!WYSIATI: System 1 doesn't take any information into account other than what is directly in front of it, even if using System 2 makes it obvious that that information is highly relevant. One example is dolphins vs. orphans. The experimenter asked a group of people how much money they would donate to charity in two separate cases--saving dolphins and saving orphans. If the examples were given singly, then the average amount given to dolphins was almost three times the amount given to orphans. If they were given together, though, then the amount given to orphans beat the amount given to dolphins because now there was a new piece of information--orphans are human, dolphins are not--that previously was ignored because even though it was highly relevant, it wasn't part of the problem presented.Feminist Bank Teller: I don't remember the formal name for this one either, but it's an error of categorization. People were presented with a description of a person, including that she was outspoken, active in women's rights organizations, brash, etc., and then asked what careers she was likely to join. ""Feminist bank teller"" was weighted higher than ""bank teller"" both on lists where they appeared singly and when they appeared together, even though all feminist bank tellers are also bank tellers and therefore bank teller must be higher probability. A similar problem can be seen with coin flips. Most people will rate THHHTH as a more likely sequence than THHH, even though the first sequence is simply the second one with extra tosses added and therefore can only be less likely.There are literally dozens of other examples I haven't mentioned, because the review simply doesn't have enough space and anyway, there's already a book (and reams of psychology research) about it. And you should read it. Everyone should read it. Everyone should know about what is going on in their mind without their knowledge.Though one warning: Thinking, Fast and Slow is extremely dense. As another review mentions, it's not always clear whether he's writing this book for psychologists or a lay audience, and some parts may require several read-throughs to figure out what Kahneman is saying and the implications thereof.Then again, maybe that's just because System 2 is lazy and dumping things onto System 1.It's not automatically as horrible as I make it out. Kahneman specifically emphasizes that our minds are set up this way because the vast majority of the time, it's good enough to function and survive. To me, though, this really is Lovecraftian--in Lovecraft's stories it was alien races and sleeping deities manipulating humanity without humanity's knowledge, and here it's the unconscious processes in our own mind. I value rationality very highly and do my best to try to be rational, but this book makes a very good case that rationality is literally impossible except in certain specific cases, and it can't be sustained since System 2 takes energy, and the more energy you use, the more likely System 2 is to give up and dump everything back on System 1 even if you know about all of these cognitive errors.So, you might find this book horribly depressing, like I did, or you may find it inspiring, like someone else I know, who said that knowing about all the natural errors in human cognition is the first step in developing a way to fix them. But either way, you should read it, because there's little that's more important to understand than the workings of your own mind."
299,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446434-hundeschlitten,2,"There are some interesting ideas here, but why do so many of these left-brain science types insist on writing their own books? Like a lot of generalized overviews written by some expert in his or her field, Daniel Kahneman's survey of the current ideas surrounding behavioral economics was a real chore to slog through at times. The book is broken into five sections and, at least to me, things really didn't start getting interesting until section three. In the first two sections, there are just too many experiments Kahneman felt the need to summarize, almost all demonstrating some way in which our decision making is less than entirely efficient. At times, I felt like I was plodding across the written equivalent of the Oregon Trail, with no end in sight. In Part Three, Kahneman begins to use these experiments to dismantle the concepts of the Chicago school of economics, which is based on the concept that we are all rational actors. But then Kahneman accepts the theory of ""highly efficient markets"" as a given, which makes no sense if their participants aren't being rational. So even here, Kahneman loses me. But at least he's being topical.Part Four features more experiments, most of which attempt to find ways in which you can trick otherwise intelligent people into making non-sensible decisions.Part Five is the most intellectually interesting part of the book, as Kahneman posits an experiencing self and a remembering self, and what this implies about how we make decisions. So unless you read very quickly, my advice is to begin at page 199, and feel free to skim some of the chapters (which are numerous but mercifully short) until you get to the final section on the two selves, which begins on page 377. "
300,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's 

. Highly recommended. I listened to the audio, and grasped most of it, but if I had it to do over again, I'd read the physical book, as there are tables to refer to, and some of the concepts require a bit more mulling over than when a narrator is breezily reading it to you."

302,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60806694-sophie-nguyen,5,"First of all, it is impossible to not notice how many people on our friend list are ""currently reading this"" or ""marked it as to-read"" (9 for me - please check yours!). What that number has to say is this 500-page work of research is a very worthwhile but by no means easy read. Rest assured, the author has made it as comprehensible as possible. The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2. Realize what you have learned in traditional Economics is seriously flawed because Humans are different from Econs. It seems like you are watching a tuff of war between Economists and Psychologists reading this. 3. Recognize that the truth is not everything but coherence is, to a flawed thinking system so change takes (a whole lot of) time to happenA disclaimer for anyone who intends to absorb this masterpiece, know beforehand that it can be:- Depressing. Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."
303,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart,5,"Wonderful ideas. I’m so glad I read this.He defines two types of thinking. Fast thinking is our intuition/instinct. We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy. He calls it “System 1.""Slow thinking is doing complicated math problems, or reading and analyzing data to come to a conclusion. He calls it “System 2.” Slow thinking takes energy. It uses glucose. People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job.

304,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn). "
305,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is probably the most important book of the 21st century. There are so many things to learn from this book. Below I've listed the ones that stood out for me.•	People intuitively can't think in probabilities.•	Fast thinking (System 1) uses heuristics (mental short-cuts), intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems.•	Slow thinking (System 2) is based on reason and deliberate thought.•	System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1•	People avoid cognitive effort (slow thinking) and rely on their intuition too much.•	Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything.•	Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.•	Intuition is nothing more than recognition (sometimes superior recognition).•	It is easier to recognize the mistakes of others than our own.•	We know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don’t know the majority of our thoughts which are in the subconscious.•	Our mood affects our subconscious thinking.•	System 2 is in-charge of detecting lies and System 1 in believing them.•	Halo effect – a tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect of their personality.•	Availability bias – most obvious and prevalent example pops up first in the mind•	Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers.•	Anchoring has a huge effect on our thinking and decisions and it can be found everywhere.•	Priming – our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit or recognize. We can be primed just by being exposed to words.•	People are very bad at dealing with small risks. Either they ignore them altogether or tend to overreact.•	People ignore base rates when come across any new information.•	We fool ourselves by constructing inaccurate accounts of the past. •	We do not recognize role of luck in our life.•	We should start judging decisions by how they were made and not only by their outcomes.•	Overconfidence in explaining the past makes us believe that we can predict the future as well.•	Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be dangerous as it reinforces your beliefs and you ignore new facts which don't match your perceptions.•	Planning fallacy – projects almost always go over budget and take longer than expected. •	Loss aversion is the driving factor in most financial and other decisions.•	Endowment Effect – value of something goes up when you own it.•	Bad events weigh much more in our mind than good things.•	Prospect theory shows how human beings decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty. It shows that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point rather than absolute outcomes.•	Do not consider one risk or gamble in isolation, think of all of them spread over a long period of time and will see that this decision actually carries very little risk.•	People keep mental accounts for their expenses/losses or actions in order to keep score. •	In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none. •	Framing of a question or a situation greatly affects our beliefs and preferences, and thus outcome."
306,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"When I picked up this book I had huge expectations. After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
307,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
308,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."

Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower.

But in 2018, I was trying to nourish my attention span by reading 20 pages a day. Thus I'm trying to pick it again and the payoff is pretty well. Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people. This book is my very first book about psychology and I really like about they're trying extract conclusions from the given data rather than hindsight assumption. "

Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating.

315,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818089-jurgen-appelo,4,A very important book. Everyone should read it. But 1 point off for being so terribly repetitive.
316,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."
317,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,5,"Edit 17th February 2017:Here's another looong blog post which goes through the studies cited by Kahneman and finds that most of them are underpowered: these studies have been run on so few students that the results they show could be wrong. As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"

326,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
327,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"

If you want to avoid ever being gulled or shanghai-ed by a magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you!Daniel Kahnemann, for the purposes of Thinking, Fast and Slow, reduces the brain to System 1 and System 2 - essentially the automatic brain and the voluntary brain. It is a great over-simplification, as he himself concedes - more so, even, than the common reduction to id, ego and superego. As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
329,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

330,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's 

. Highly recommended. I listened to the audio, and grasped most of it, but if I had it to do over again, I'd read the physical book, as there are tables to refer to, and some of the concepts require a bit more mulling over than when a narrator is breezily reading it to you."

I was tempted to read fast (because it’s interesting) but I forced myself to slow down, reading Michael Lewis’ The Undoing Project for a change of rhythm."

What that number has to say is this 500-page work of research is a very worthwhile but by no means easy read. Rest assured, the author has made it as comprehensible as possible. The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2. Realize what you have learned in traditional Economics is seriously flawed because Humans are different from Econs. It seems like you are watching a tuff of war between Economists and Psychologists reading this. 3. Recognize that the truth is not everything but coherence is, to a flawed thinking system so change takes (a whole lot of) time to happenA disclaimer for anyone who intends to absorb this masterpiece, know beforehand that it can be:- Depressing. Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."
333,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart,5,"Wonderful ideas. I’m so glad I read this.He defines two types of thinking. Fast thinking is our intuition/instinct. We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy. He calls it “System 1.""Slow thinking is doing complicated math problems, or reading and analyzing data to come to a conclusion. He calls it “System 2.” Slow thinking takes energy. It uses glucose. People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job.

334,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn).

335,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is probably the most important book of the 21st century. There are so many things to learn from this book. Below I've listed the ones that stood out for me.•	People intuitively can't think in probabilities.•	Fast thinking (System 1) uses heuristics (mental short-cuts), intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems.•	Slow thinking (System 2) is based on reason and deliberate thought.•	System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1•	People avoid cognitive effort (slow thinking) and rely on their intuition too much.•	Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything.•	Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.•	Intuition is nothing more than recognition (sometimes superior recognition).•	It is easier to recognize the mistakes of others than our own.•	We know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don’t know the majority of our thoughts which are in the subconscious.•	Our mood affects our subconscious thinking.•	System 2 is in-charge of detecting lies and System 1 in believing them.•	Halo effect – a tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect of their personality.•	Availability bias – most obvious and prevalent example pops up first in the mind•	Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers.•	Anchoring has a huge effect on our thinking and decisions and it can be found everywhere.•	Priming – our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit or recognize. We can be primed just by being exposed to words.•	People are very bad at dealing with small risks. Either they ignore them altogether or tend to overreact.•	People ignore base rates when come across any new information.•	We fool ourselves by constructing inaccurate accounts of the past. •	We do not recognize role of luck in our life.•	We should start judging decisions by how they were made and not only by their outcomes.•	Overconfidence in explaining the past makes us believe that we can predict the future as well.•	Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be dangerous as it reinforces your beliefs and you ignore new facts which don't match your perceptions.•	Planning fallacy – projects almost always go over budget and take longer than expected. •	Loss aversion is the driving factor in most financial and other decisions.•	Endowment Effect – value of something goes up when you own it.•	Bad events weigh much more in our mind than good things.•	Prospect theory shows how human beings decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty. It shows that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point rather than absolute outcomes.•	Do not consider one risk or gamble in isolation, think of all of them spread over a long period of time and will see that this decision actually carries very little risk.•	People keep mental accounts for their expenses/losses or actions in order to keep score. •	In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none. •	Framing of a question or a situation greatly affects our beliefs and preferences, and thus outcome."
336,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"When I picked up this book I had huge expectations. After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
337,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
338,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."

Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower.

Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people.

It did not particularly long for me to come around to read it afterwards and I am really glad I did. Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating.

346,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."
347,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,5,"Edit 17th February 2017:Here's another looong blog post which goes through the studies cited by Kahneman and finds that most of them are underpowered: these studies have been run on so few students that the results they show could be wrong. As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"

Kahneman's ""Thinking fast and slow"" is yet another contribution to this stack of popular science literature.During my studies I have read the academic articles of Kahneman and Tsversky on prospect theory, judgement, and framing of decisions. And I looked forward to reading this popular work. I liked the book, but I did not find it exceptionally good. Especially the later chapters could have been written somewhat clearer. and all in all, nothing new is presented. The book leans somewhat heavier on mathematical examples than other books in this field. This is perfectly fine, but makes it a bit less leisure to read.

356,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
357,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"
358,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36947487-luke-marsden,4,"If you are an aspiring magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you. If you want to avoid ever being gulled or shanghai-ed by a magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you!Daniel Kahnemann, for the purposes of Thinking, Fast and Slow, reduces the brain to System 1 and System 2 - essentially the automatic brain and the voluntary brain. It is a great over-simplification, as he himself concedes - more so, even, than the common reduction to id, ego and superego. As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
359,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

360,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's

The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2.

Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."

We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy. He calls it “System 1.""Slow thinking is doing complicated math problems, or reading and analyzing data to come to a conclusion. He calls it “System 2.” Slow thinking takes energy. It uses glucose. People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job. DATA:Narrative mode: a mixture of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook length: 20 hrs and 2 mins. Swearing language: none that I recall. Sexual content: none. Book copyright: 2011. Genre: psychology, economics, nonfiction."
364,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn). "
365,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is probably the most important book of the 21st century. There are so many things to learn from this book. Below I've listed the ones that stood out for me.•	People intuitively can't think in probabilities.•	Fast thinking (System 1) uses heuristics (mental short-cuts), intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems.•	Slow thinking (System 2) is based on reason and deliberate thought.•	System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1•	People avoid cognitive effort (slow thinking) and rely on their intuition too much.•	Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything.•	Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.•	Intuition is nothing more than recognition (sometimes superior recognition).•	It is easier to recognize the mistakes of others than our own.•	We know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don’t know the majority of our thoughts which are in the subconscious.•	Our mood affects our subconscious thinking.•	System 2 is in-charge of detecting lies and System 1 in believing them.•	Halo effect – a tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect of their personality.•	Availability bias – most obvious and prevalent example pops up first in the mind•	Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers.•	Anchoring has a huge effect on our thinking and decisions and it can be found everywhere.•	Priming – our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit or recognize. We can be primed just by being exposed to words.•	People are very bad at dealing with small risks. Either they ignore them altogether or tend to overreact.•	People ignore base rates when come across any new information.•	We fool ourselves by constructing inaccurate accounts of the past. •	We do not recognize role of luck in our life.•	We should start judging decisions by how they were made and not only by their outcomes.•	Overconfidence in explaining the past makes us believe that we can predict the future as well.•	Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be dangerous as it reinforces your beliefs and you ignore new facts which don't match your perceptions.•	Planning fallacy – projects almost always go over budget and take longer than expected. •	Loss aversion is the driving factor in most financial and other decisions.•	Endowment Effect – value of something goes up when you own it.•	Bad events weigh much more in our mind than good things.•	Prospect theory shows how human beings decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty. It shows that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point rather than absolute outcomes.•	Do not consider one risk or gamble in isolation, think of all of them spread over a long period of time and will see that this decision actually carries very little risk.•	People keep mental accounts for their expenses/losses or actions in order to keep score. •	In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none. •	Framing of a question or a situation greatly affects our beliefs and preferences, and thus outcome."
366,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"When I picked up this book I had huge expectations. After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
367,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
368,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."
370,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-str-mquist,4,"""Absolutely amazing two-thirds of a book! Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower. I almost felt like the last part of the book was penned by a different author. 400 pages of brilliance though."""
371,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80511965-naing-lin,4,"I tried to read it two or three years ago. Since it's long read and I'm couldn't focus back then. So, I dropped it. But in 2018, I was trying to nourish my attention span by reading 20 pages a day. Thus I'm trying to pick it again and the payoff is pretty well. Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people. This book is my very first book about psychology and I really like about they're trying extract conclusions from the given data rather than hindsight assumption. "
372,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I flat-out stayed clear of this book for at least a year, until I finally picked up at an airport earlier this month. It did not particularly long for me to come around to read it afterwards and I am really glad I did. Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating. Tis is a book that requires slow reading, but it's definitely worth it."

An achievement of lifelong investigating into what makes us tick, Kahneman presents a multitude of instances (with examples) of how we come to make the decisions we do - and how often they are the ""wrong"" ones. This book is accessible, engaging and written with the mass consumer in mind (rather than a scientific journal) - without the feeling like the reader is being talked down to. I can't recommend this book strongly enough."

For the most part, he made it as ""user friendly"" as he could. There were many parts of the book that his diagrams were invaluable. Many things in this book are things we've been told in stuff like ""Brain Games"" but reading his explanations made things make soooo much more sense on why our brains act like that. Highly recommend!"
375,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818089-jurgen-appelo,4,A very important book. Everyone should read it. But 1 point off for being so terribly repetitive.
376,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."
377,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,5,"Edit 17th February 2017:Here's another looong blog post which goes through the studies cited by Kahneman and finds that most of them are underpowered: these studies have been run on so few students that the results they show could be wrong. As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"
378,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6798013-marjolein,4,"There have been quite a lot of books on irrationality and cognitive biases lately. Kahneman's ""Thinking fast and slow"" is yet another contribution to this stack of popular science literature.During my studies I have read the academic articles of Kahneman and Tsversky on prospect theory, judgement, and framing of decisions. And I looked forward to reading this popular work. I liked the book, but I did not find it exceptionally good. Especially the later chapters could have been written somewhat clearer. and all in all, nothing new is presented. The book leans somewhat heavier on mathematical examples than other books in this field. This is perfectly fine, but makes it a bit less leisure to read.

Almost half of the material was covered in part by other books that I have read on the subject. Kahneman, Tveresky & co have shown how rational we really are ! And they have done this lucidly, with a great no. of examples to make it accessible to laymen. It is chilling at times to see the mirror but it is better to be aware of systemic biases in our species’ thinking. Must read !"

This is one of the rarest non-fictions that has as much value in its whole as much as in its summary. You could get the 'what' of the book in summary and feel sufficed; but to pore deeply and meticulously to identify the thousand 'why's of your thought process, the laziness of the brain, the intuitions, the cheats, the hindsight, and the misjudgments edifies and keeps you on guard."

386,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
387,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"

If you want to avoid ever being gulled or shanghai-ed by a magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you!Daniel Kahnemann, for the purposes of Thinking, Fast and Slow, reduces the brain to System 1 and System 2 - essentially the automatic brain and the voluntary brain. It is a great over-simplification, as he himself concedes - more so, even, than the common reduction to id, ego and superego. As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
389,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

390,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's 

. Highly recommended. I listened to the audio, and grasped most of it, but if I had it to do over again, I'd read the physical book, as there are tables to refer to, and some of the concepts require a bit more mulling over than when a narrator is breezily reading it to you."

What that number has to say is this 500-page work of research is a very worthwhile but by no means easy read. Rest assured, the author has made it as comprehensible as possible. The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2. Realize what you have learned in traditional Economics is seriously flawed because Humans are different from Econs. It seems like you are watching a tuff of war between Economists and Psychologists reading this. 3. Recognize that the truth is not everything but coherence is, to a flawed thinking system so change takes (a whole lot of) time to happenA disclaimer for anyone who intends to absorb this masterpiece, know beforehand that it can be:- Depressing. Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."

We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy. He calls it “System 1.""Slow thinking is doing complicated math problems, or reading and analyzing data to come to a conclusion. He calls it “System 2.” Slow thinking takes energy. It uses glucose. People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job.

394,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn).

After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
397,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
398,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."

Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower.

But in 2018, I was trying to nourish my attention span by reading 20 pages a day. Thus I'm trying to pick it again and the payoff is pretty well. Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people.

Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating.

405,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818089-jurgen-appelo,4,A very important book. Everyone should read it. But 1 point off for being so terribly repetitive.
406,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."
407,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,5,"Edit 17th February 2017:Here's another looong blog post which goes through the studies cited by Kahneman and finds that most of them are underpowered: these studies have been run on so few students that the results they show could be wrong. As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"

416,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
417,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"

As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
419,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

420,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's 

. Highly recommended. I listened to the audio, and grasped most of it, but if I had it to do over again, I'd read the physical book, as there are tables to refer to, and some of the concepts require a bit more mulling over than when a narrator is breezily reading it to you."

I was tempted to read fast (because it’s interesting) but I forced myself to slow down, reading Michael Lewis’ The Undoing Project for a change of rhythm."

What that number has to say is this 500-page work of research is a very worthwhile but by no means easy read. Rest assured, the author has made it as comprehensible as possible. The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2. Realize what you have learned in traditional Economics is seriously flawed because Humans are different from Econs. It seems like you are watching a tuff of war between Economists and Psychologists reading this. 3. Recognize that the truth is not everything but coherence is, to a flawed thinking system so change takes (a whole lot of) time to happenA disclaimer for anyone who intends to absorb this masterpiece, know beforehand that it can be:- Depressing. Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."

We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy. He calls it “System 1.""Slow thinking is doing complicated math problems, or reading and analyzing data to come to a conclusion. He calls it “System 2.” Slow thinking takes energy. It uses glucose. People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job.

424,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn). "
425,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is probably the most important book of the 21st century. There are so many things to learn from this book. Below I've listed the ones that stood out for me.•	People intuitively can't think in probabilities.•	Fast thinking (System 1) uses heuristics (mental short-cuts), intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems.•	Slow thinking (System 2) is based on reason and deliberate thought.•	System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1•	People avoid cognitive effort (slow thinking) and rely on their intuition too much.•	Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything.•	Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.•	Intuition is nothing more than recognition (sometimes superior recognition).•	It is easier to recognize the mistakes of others than our own.•	We know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don’t know the majority of our thoughts which are in the subconscious.•	Our mood affects our subconscious thinking.•	System 2 is in-charge of detecting lies and System 1 in believing them.•	Halo effect – a tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect of their personality.•	Availability bias – most obvious and prevalent example pops up first in the mind•	Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers.•	Anchoring has a huge effect on our thinking and decisions and it can be found everywhere.•	Priming – our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit or recognize. We can be primed just by being exposed to words.•	People are very bad at dealing with small risks. Either they ignore them altogether or tend to overreact.•	People ignore base rates when come across any new information.•	We fool ourselves by constructing inaccurate accounts of the past. •	We do not recognize role of luck in our life.•	We should start judging decisions by how they were made and not only by their outcomes.•	Overconfidence in explaining the past makes us believe that we can predict the future as well.•	Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be dangerous as it reinforces your beliefs and you ignore new facts which don't match your perceptions.•	Planning fallacy – projects almost always go over budget and take longer than expected. •	Loss aversion is the driving factor in most financial and other decisions.•	Endowment Effect – value of something goes up when you own it.•	Bad events weigh much more in our mind than good things.•	Prospect theory shows how human beings decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty. It shows that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point rather than absolute outcomes.•	Do not consider one risk or gamble in isolation, think of all of them spread over a long period of time and will see that this decision actually carries very little risk.•	People keep mental accounts for their expenses/losses or actions in order to keep score. •	In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none. •	Framing of a question or a situation greatly affects our beliefs and preferences, and thus outcome."
426,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"When I picked up this book I had huge expectations. After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
427,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
428,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."

Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower.

Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people.

It did not particularly long for me to come around to read it afterwards and I am really glad I did. Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating.

This book is accessible, engaging and written with the mass consumer in mind (rather than a scientific journal) - without the feeling like the reader is being talked down to.

435,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818089-jurgen-appelo,4,A very important book. Everyone should read it. But 1 point off for being so terribly repetitive.
436,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."
437,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,5,"Edit 17th February 2017:Here's another looong blog post which goes through the studies cited by Kahneman and finds that most of them are underpowered: these studies have been run on so few students that the results they show could be wrong. As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"

Kahneman's ""Thinking fast and slow"" is yet another contribution to this stack of popular science literature.During my studies I have read the academic articles of Kahneman and Tsversky on prospect theory, judgement, and framing of decisions. And I looked forward to reading this popular work. I liked the book, but I did not find it exceptionally good. Especially the later chapters could have been written somewhat clearer. and all in all, nothing new is presented. The book leans somewhat heavier on mathematical examples than other books in this field. This is perfectly fine, but makes it a bit less leisure to read.

446,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
447,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"

If you want to avoid ever being gulled or shanghai-ed by a magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you!Daniel Kahnemann, for the purposes of Thinking, Fast and Slow, reduces the brain to System 1 and System 2 - essentially the automatic brain and the voluntary brain. It is a great over-simplification, as he himself concedes - more so, even, than the common reduction to id, ego and superego. As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
449,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

450,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's

What that number has to say is this 500-page work of research is a very worthwhile but by no means easy read. Rest assured, the author has made it as comprehensible as possible. The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2. Realize what you have learned in traditional Economics is seriously flawed because Humans are different from Econs. It seems like you are watching a tuff of war between Economists and Psychologists reading this. 3. Recognize that the truth is not everything but coherence is, to a flawed thinking system so change takes (a whole lot of) time to happenA disclaimer for anyone who intends to absorb this masterpiece, know beforehand that it can be:- Depressing. Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."

We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy. He calls it “System 1.""Slow thinking is doing complicated math problems, or reading and analyzing data to come to a conclusion. He calls it “System 2.” Slow thinking takes energy. It uses glucose. People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job. DATA:Narrative mode: a mixture of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook length: 20 hrs and 2 mins. Swearing language: none that I recall. Sexual content: none. Book copyright: 2011.

454,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn). "
455,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is probably the most important book of the 21st century. There are so many things to learn from this book. Below I've listed the ones that stood out for me.•	People intuitively can't think in probabilities.•	Fast thinking (System 1) uses heuristics (mental short-cuts), intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems.•	Slow thinking (System 2) is based on reason and deliberate thought.•	System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1•	People avoid cognitive effort (slow thinking) and rely on their intuition too much.•	Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything.•	Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.•	Intuition is nothing more than recognition (sometimes superior recognition).•	It is easier to recognize the mistakes of others than our own.•	We know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don’t know the majority of our thoughts which are in the subconscious.•	Our mood affects our subconscious thinking.•	System 2 is in-charge of detecting lies and System 1 in believing them.•	Halo effect – a tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect of their personality.•	Availability bias – most obvious and prevalent example pops up first in the mind•	Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers.•	Anchoring has a huge effect on our thinking and decisions and it can be found everywhere.•	Priming – our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit or recognize. We can be primed just by being exposed to words.•	People are very bad at dealing with small risks. Either they ignore them altogether or tend to overreact.•	People ignore base rates when come across any new information.•	We fool ourselves by constructing inaccurate accounts of the past. •	We do not recognize role of luck in our life.•	We should start judging decisions by how they were made and not only by their outcomes.•	Overconfidence in explaining the past makes us believe that we can predict the future as well.•	Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be dangerous as it reinforces your beliefs and you ignore new facts which don't match your perceptions.•	Planning fallacy – projects almost always go over budget and take longer than expected. •	Loss aversion is the driving factor in most financial and other decisions.•	Endowment Effect – value of something goes up when you own it.•	Bad events weigh much more in our mind than good things.•	Prospect theory shows how human beings decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty. It shows that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point rather than absolute outcomes.•	Do not consider one risk or gamble in isolation, think of all of them spread over a long period of time and will see that this decision actually carries very little risk.•	People keep mental accounts for their expenses/losses or actions in order to keep score. •	In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none. •	Framing of a question or a situation greatly affects our beliefs and preferences, and thus outcome."
456,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"When I picked up this book I had huge expectations. After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
457,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
458,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."
460,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-str-mquist,4,"""Absolutely amazing two-thirds of a book! Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower. I almost felt like the last part of the book was penned by a different author. 400 pages of brilliance though."""
461,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80511965-naing-lin,4,"I tried to read it two or three years ago. Since it's long read and I'm couldn't focus back then. So, I dropped it. But in 2018, I was trying to nourish my attention span by reading 20 pages a day. Thus I'm trying to pick it again and the payoff is pretty well. Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people. This book is my very first book about psychology and I really like about they're trying extract conclusions from the given data rather than hindsight assumption. "

It did not particularly long for me to come around to read it afterwards and I am really glad I did. Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating. Tis is a book that requires slow reading, but it's definitely worth it."

An achievement of lifelong investigating into what makes us tick, Kahneman presents a multitude of instances (with examples) of how we come to make the decisions we do - and how often they are the ""wrong"" ones. This book is accessible, engaging and written with the mass consumer in mind (rather than a scientific journal) - without the feeling like the reader is being talked down to. I can't recommend this book strongly enough."

For the most part, he made it as ""user friendly"" as he could. There were many parts of the book that his diagrams were invaluable. Many things in this book are things we've been told in stuff like ""Brain Games"" but reading his explanations made things make soooo much more sense on why our brains act like that. Highly recommend!"
465,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818089-jurgen-appelo,4,A very important book. Everyone should read it. But 1 point off for being so terribly repetitive.
466,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."
467,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,5,"Edit 17th February 2017:Here's another looong blog post which goes through the studies cited by Kahneman and finds that most of them are underpowered: these studies have been run on so few students that the results they show could be wrong. As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"

And I looked forward to reading this popular work. I liked the book, but I did not find it exceptionally good. Especially the later chapters could have been written somewhat clearer. and all in all, nothing new is presented.

Almost half of the material was covered in part by other books that I have read on the subject. Kahneman, Tveresky & co have shown how rational we really are ! And they have done this lucidly, with a great no. of examples to make it accessible to laymen. It is chilling at times to see the mirror but it is better to be aware of systemic biases in our species’ thinking. Must read !"

Just by looking at the references of the book, I am seized with awestruck and then guilt if my words are not enough to pay my tribute to the author and his masterpiece.However I must remind myself that what in the book are theories and they would have their limits when come to reality.

This is one of the rarest non-fictions that has as much value in its whole as much as in its summary. You could get the 'what' of the book in summary and feel sufficed; but to pore deeply and meticulously to identify the thousand 'why's of your thought process, the laziness of the brain, the intuitions, the cheats, the hindsight, and the misjudgments edifies and keeps you on guard."

476,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
477,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"
478,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36947487-luke-marsden,4,"If you are an aspiring magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you. If you want to avoid ever being gulled or shanghai-ed by a magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you!Daniel Kahnemann, for the purposes of Thinking, Fast and Slow, reduces the brain to System 1 and System 2 - essentially the automatic brain and the voluntary brain. It is a great over-simplification, as he himself concedes - more so, even, than the common reduction to id, ego and superego. As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
479,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

I had put this in my every year to-read-list for 3 consecutive years and the hope of finishing it had been thin. This time last year I picked up Leonardo da Vinci and it dragged on for 6 months. I learned a valuable lesson from then on, that’s it’s okay to have an affair with books. While reading this book, I've swept through a whole YA Fantasy series and even started another book. What kept me afloat was a simple rule, I only had to read this book 1 hour every day, then I could be off to read whatever I want. There were days my will power was too low that I might give myself a break by immersing on a romance novel and come back fresher the next day.   2 months came by like a rush, and now I feel sorry this book ended so soon.    Why do we need to read this book when we can read a summary version of it online and eagerly tell anyone who asks that this book was a-okay? Because you read to understand. Only when you can summarise this book from your own understanding of it can you know that it will stick with you and be of help in your life for a long time. Please do not read this if you have no interest in human behaviors, you do not really care why we do what we do, or how we make mistakes, how we come up with decisions. That time can be well spent doing many things else but reading Thinking, Fast and SlowHowever if you need to understand this fast for work or any project, you can read 2 of the authors’ researches that built up this book, then start reading the book when you feel up for the commitment.And now the question is, when will I finish Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder?

481,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"My favorite passage: ""When I asked my large undergraduate class in some indignation, 'Do you realize that you have violated an elementary logical rule?' someone in the back row shouted, 'So what?'"" (p.158).Most relevant for me were the many examples of the striking differences in between subjects and within subjects experiments. So, for example, when subjects were asked to judge the value of the following sets of dinnerware presented together, they judged set A as more valuable:SET A: 40 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good condition8 cups, 2 of them broken8 saucers, 7 of them brokenSET B: 24 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good conditionBut when subjects saw only one or the other of the two sets, they judged SET B to be worth more than SET A. Why? When presented with the sets together, they could make a comparative judgment and see that SET A contained more items in good shape than set B. But seen individually, they make a snap judgment of average value of the items in the set, which is higher in SET B than in SET A. I couldn't help but think about the relevance of this idea when you're putting your CV together. Say there are two candidates for a job. Candidate A has two publications in really good journals. Candidate B has two publications in equally good journals, and also two publications in unrefereed conference proceedings or journals edited by her friends. Considered side by side, maybe Candidate B has a slight advantage over A, but considered individually, Candidate A looks better. The average level of her publications is higher than B's. Maybe I should prune my list of conference presentations in light of this finding.Kahneman says (p.354) that ""We normally experience life in the between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent..."" and that in making decisions we should encourage consideration of ""broad context"", which includes alternatives (p.361). This is clearly relevant to debates about contextualism and invariantism, conversational context, and the standard linguistic methodology of eliciting intuitions from subjects about individual cases isolated from contrasting cases.

Maybe it's my problem. Maybe I just think differently. I suspect this book is written for left brained thinkers. I am very much a right brained thinker. Consequently, the author would pose a problem, assume the reader came to a certain conclusion, then built his thesis on the conclusion he assumes the reader arrived at. The problem was I never I arrived at his preconceived conclusions. Maybe because he assumes our brains all work a certain way. Ironic at that.Here's some examples. He gives a problem and tells us not to try to solve it but listen to our intuition:A ball and a bat cost $1.10The bat cost one dollar more than the bat.How much does the ball cost?Then he goes on to explain that the number that came to our mind was 10 cents because the ""distinctive mark of an easy puzzle is intuitive, appealing and wrong."" Then he informs us that the actual cost of the ball is 5 cents.But that is not how I read the problem. And since I didn't know where he was going with the puzzle, I assumed he was testing our ability to catch logical fallacies.When the statement said a ball and a bat cost $1.10, I assumed that he meant they EACH cost $1.10. After all he did not say the sum of the cost or that ""together"" they cost. I then went on to conclude the next two sentences were wrong.So does that make me stupid?Here's another one: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?According to the author the answer is determined whether the reader will remember that Detroit is in Michigan.OK. But the question was not whether Michigan has a high rate of murders, or higher than other states. The question was what number of murders occur in Michigan. Isn't that what ""how many murders"" means?My answer was, how the heck do I know the number of murders that occur anywhere without consulting a reliable census source?Needless to say I found this book frustrating and not a very reliable source for learning about cognitive functions."

It also means I finished a book that I bought in 2015 ""because it was a book one ought to read"". I couldn't voluntarily take it off the shelf to read. What got me to read and finish and enjoy this book was reading it with some colleagues at work. The issue came up during a training class - I actually do not remember how - and several of us decided that we would read a section of the book every two weeks. There were five sections so we would finish in approximately 10 weeks. This way, there was room for busy events at work that could keep us from reading or the events of our own lives. The period of two weeks wasn't too long so that fast readers would get impatient or bored, or that anyone would forget anything. We met for only 30 minutes - either during lunch or a short time after where we each stated one thing we liked and one thing we disliked, after which we could have a free discussion. Stating one thing we liked or disliked was merely a device for ensuring all could be heard and to try to structure our thoughts in the short time frame.It worked. But I am not finished with the book. Oh yes, I read the book. However, this is not a quick read that you put back on the shelf and ignore. There are some heavy-duty thoughts in here that I, for one, will need to lean on for a long time when referencing points during a discussion. Also, some parts were a little over my head - I haven't studied probability so I lacked the vocabulary to grasp those areas well. However, to Kahneman's praise, his writing meant that I could plow through those bits and still get his point.I have already been recommending this book to others. While carrying it around at work for our meetings, some people I knew would say ""oh, excellent book"", so it almost became a secret handshake. :)All in all, I had a good experience reading and digesting this book. :)"
484,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"If you want to read a layman's introduction into the psychology of decision making, Kahneman's book is probably the best. Dan Ariely has written similar books, but his are kind of jokey, lightweight, and unnuanced. Thinking, Fast and Slow is unlike most bestsellers in that it assumes the reader is intelligent and isn't on the beach or skimming. It's not particularly engaging - Kahneman's writing is on the dry and pedantic side - but this book is carefully written, and packed with fifty years of work in the field of decision making. While of course Kahneman tends to focus on his own research, he is very generous in citing and lauding the work of others. In a lot of ways, this book is a very impressive achievement.Unlike Ariely, Kahneman doesn't emphasize the follies in the way our brain works. Rather he very simply, plainly, and convincingly shows how we as humans tend to go from point A to point B in our thinking. The examples he uses are very easy to grasp if you are a careful reader. I'd say, using the parlance of Kahneman, that if you have a well developed System 2 - patience and a love of slow thinking - and an interest in how humans think you'll enjoy this book. It's probably also true that the kind of person who'll find Thinking, Fast and Slow interesting will consistently find that he or she is in the minority population in the examples cited. At least that's what I found. If Kahneman says something like 84 percent will say A and 16 percent will say B in response to a question, I'll be in the 16 percent. Finding myself consistently in the minority was an illuminating thing, actually. I've always ascribed my tendency for oddball thinking to my strange background of growing up around war survivors and Hassidic Jews. Nope. Now I realize that I'm just a System 2 kind of guy."
485,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"4Thinking, Fast and Slow for the better part is a solid and interesting read. My central complaint is the repetitive later sections of the book. Apart from that this is a must-read book for everybody. Understanding the way you think is worth the early chapters, and it's quite a simplistic design for consumption. It does get heavy in the latter half of the book, and to be honest I was quite bored here myself. But, make no mistake, Daniel Kahneman has created something unique and informative. The structure of the book was interesting, with the common stage 1 & 2 mapped throughout. I will say this, you won't finish the book and not understand these two meanings. There feels like a repeat of information here, but there is a lot to digest. I quite liked the idea of the book and I think structurally it's okay. Some of the information should've been condensed at times, but more might be something the majority of readers wanted. I enjoy reading books like this to understand the why. This book explains so much and that's why I continued to read and finish it. Why the 4?I can understand why certain reviews have marked it tedious. I get that. I did found it tough to read in that final 100 pages, but I was more engaged with finishing and information overload. This is a good book. The author has thrown in so much, so in hindsight I would recommend slowly digesting if you're allowed. That comment is more to the owner of the book, the library reader has to make the call based on the amount of people in the waiting list. I discovered a lot here, and as creatures of habit, you will notice these examples day after day. You can't unread what you've learned. I recommend reading this and not force reading it like I did. It's a book to slow down and read from time to time. "

I would just like to be able to memorize it all.The insight of making us understand how the human mind works and why we make some choices, is just brilliant.The only regret I have is that even if you read and understand things， the way our brain is wired， its software， can not be easily changed. This means that even if you are aware of things， it does not mean you are not susceptible for falling into traps. I cannot copy here the entire book content， but I will give an example:<“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion”. Moses took no animals into the ark;Noah did. The Moses illusion is explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context， and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him， but the mention of his name is not surprising. It also helps that Moses and Noah have the same vowel sound and number of syllables， so you unconsciously detect associative coherence between “Moses” and “ark” and so quickly accept the question. Replace Moses with George W Bush in this sentence and you will have a poor political joke but no illusion.>"

Within the first part of this book you've experienced all there is to experience. Kahneman goes through this book repeating the same theories in different ways again and again. Every now and then there will be a brief interlude of him bragging about his Nobel Prize or some other research he did that doesn't fully apply. This book got off to quite a bad start with me as it is 100% directed at Americans. I felt like many of the examples just confused the points more as they were based on knowledge that I, as an Australian, do not have just generally. He also frequently gives an example of an effect and then says ""You thought this"". A majority of the time though I did not think what he claimed, making me frustrated at the writing and the theory he then presented. I feel like this book was very much a cocky piece of writing in which the author frequently claimed that as a population we're pretty stupid. I can understand this was not his intention, but it came across that way. If you do want to read this book, I suggest a brief skimming of the conclusions section in the back. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. "

Curiously; he only devotes one chapter of this book to his field of expertise (but it is a heck of a chapter; I tell ya) He explains how our brains think in two ways: slow and fast. Our fast brain help us make quick decisions so we don't get ran over by cars or hit by balls; or stand up for days on the supermarket isles deciding which product to buy. The second system thinks more slowly and that is the one that help us make the most important decisions in our lives like to whom we will get married and for whom we should work. Well; those two systems trend to interact and screw up each other; so this is why the world is so screwed up. The book is pretty scientific; and dense. I understood probably a third of it; but I liked chap. 1 and the conclussions; and I honestly tried the statistics one (chap 3;4) and the economics ones (5); but as I said it was difficult. I think this book would be very good as an object of study in specialized classes. I really liked it. I gave it 9 weeks of my time. It is really good.

It's significantly more detailed and scientific than other pop-science books in the genre by Malcolm Gladwell et al.You can break up the book into 3 parts.In the first part, he dismantles the rational choice theory. Kahneman says he is not out to dismantle classical economic theory, according to him, he is not questioning the rational agent theory, he is just establishing that humans are not rational agents. (Cool story bro.)He then proceeds to dismantle another popular assumption, that humans always try to maximize utility. The third part of the book, about the 'science of happiness' was easily the least interesting part of the book. Coincidentally, this part of the book comprises mostly of work done after Tversky's death. My biggest problem with this book and many other books of this genre is the constant repetition. Frankly, this book is much better than others in this respect. That only speaks to how absurd other books are.This was a fantastic read but I think I am done with books like this for a while."

I had put this book down when I was younger and determined to take up this challenge for myself, I decided to read 50 pages per day years later. And I completed it within a month! Undoubtedly, my most difficult and yet enriching, it almost felt like attending economics classes and feeling doubly intelligent while reading this one. Daniel Kahneman is a Genius...He talks about how our mind processes things, how judgements happen and why we jump to conclusions, why we always chose the easy way to do things, risk luck and intuition and many more theories. ..Don’t buy this one if you’re looking for an easy-breezy read, but if you’re willing to dive into making your brain take the harder way into understanding these concepts, on Economics and Behavioural Psychology with interesting case studies, don’t miss this one written by a Nobel Laureate ⭐️"

I had initially dismissed this book without reading it, thinking it would be about business/economics (I’d blame it on the blurb found on the cover, something from the author of Freakonomics). I read it because I found out it’s a pretty famous book on Goodreads.com I enjoyed parts of the book; I’d say 3/5th of it. I had skimmed through mostly the rest of it as it was too technical. The book is a very deep and technical study (as far as I’m concerned) on behavioural sciences and economics. But whatever I did read, it was excellent. The use of examples and sample question scenarios helped in understanding how the brain works and how & why we think the way we think. It is not a light read; it required me to sit up and actively understand it. Not really my type of a book, and I probably wouldn’t want to read anything similar. "

It will make you more aware of your own biases, though not necessarily change the way you make decisions. As you'll find out, most biases are hard to overcome even when you're aware of them.The book describes how the human mind employs two modes of thinking - Fast (unconscious, impulsive) and Slow (conscious, deliberate), the limitations of this system and implications in various fields - behavioral economics, education, health, happiness, management, etc.Overall, this is a great read and an eye opener."

Although I appreciate the detail in which the author goes into, at times it was a bit much for me, which made it a sluggish read at times.I did like how Kahneman, to demonstrate concepts, asks you questions or has you look at pictures, and then explains what was occurring in your mind during that exercise. A fascinating and enlightening read."

496,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman“Thinking, Fast and Slow” is a fascinating look at how the mind works. Drawing on knowledge acquired from years of research in cognitive and social psychology, Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Daniel Kahneman delivers his magnum opus on Behavioral Economics. This excellent book focuses on the three key sets of distinctions: between the automatic System 1 and the effortful System 2, between the conception of agents in classical economics and in behavioral economics, and between the experiencing and the remembering selves. This enlightening 512-page book is composed of thirty-eight chapters and broken out by the following five Parts: Part I. Two Systems, Part II. Heuristics and Biases, Part III. Overconfidence, Part IV. Choices, and Part V. Two Selves.Positives:1.	Award-winning research. A masterpiece of behavioral economics knowledge. Overall accessible.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of a master. How the mind works. The biases of intuition, judgment, and decision making. 3.	Excellent format. Each chapter is well laid out and ends with a Speaking of section that summarizes the content via quotes.4.	A great job of defining and summarizing new terms. ""In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."" 5.	Supports findings with countless research. Provides many accessible and practical examples that help readers understand the insightful conclusions.6.	A great job of letting us what we know and to what degree. ""It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work.""7.	You are guaranteed to learn something. Countless tidbits of knowledge throughout this insightful book and how it applies to the read world. ""The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.""8.	The differences of Systems 1 and 2 and how they function with one another. ""System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."" ""System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.""9.	Important recurring concepts like WYSIATI (What You See Is All There IS). ""You surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle.""10.	Understanding heuristics and biases. ""The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.""11.	Paradoxical results for your enjoyment. ""People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it.""12.	Understanding how our brains work, ""The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.""13.	Wisdom. ""'Risk' does not exist 'out there,' independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as 'real risk' or 'objective risk.'"" Bonus. ""To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.""14.	You will learn lessons that are practical. ""Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.""15.	An interesting look at overconfidence. ""Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."" ""Remember this rule: intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.""16.	Have you ever had to plan anything in your life? Meet the planning fallacy. ""This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an “outside view” and is the cure to the planning fallacy.""17.	A very interesting look at Econs and Humans. ""Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices.""18.	 Prospect theory explained. ""The pain of losing $900 is more than 90% of the pain of losing $1,000. These two insights are the essence of prospect theory.""19.	Avoiding poor psychology. ""The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.""20.	Great stuff on well being. 21.	An excellent Conclusions chapter that ties the book up comprehensively.Negatives:1.	Notes not linked up.2.	No formal separate bibliography.3.	Requires an investment of time. Thankfully, the book is worthy of your time.4.	The book overall is very well-written and accessible but some topics are challenging. 5.	Wanted more clarification on how Bayes's rules work.In summary, a masterpiece on behavioral economics. Dr. Kahneman shares his years of research and provides readers with an education on how the mind works. It requires an investment of your time but it so well worth it.

How mind is able to construct a whole story with very little information available.

498,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41549696-jennifer-malinowski,4,"Very long book (the audiobook seemed to drag on interminably at times) describing Kahneman's premise that people have two different strategies for decision-making, called System 1 and System 2 (Fast and Slow). Overall, I think the book is a decent introduction for someone who is interested in why we make the choices we do, who doesn't already have a grasp of the theories or recently published studies in psychology and economics. That said, if you do, I don't think you'd find this book as interesting or helpful in extending your knowledge. Though by no means an expert in either, I have followed both fields, particularly where they intersect and have to do with consumer decision-making, and subsequently felt the book dragged on in parts and at times, even felt a little dated.Overall, a very solid 4* read. "
499,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009217-jonathan-donihue,5,"First off, I just want to say that this was one of the most arduous reading experiences of my life. ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is an amazing book, but it's not a casual read. That being said, I think it's one of the most important books of our time.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is a book about how we, as humans, make decisions. The author, Daniel Kahneman is an Economist and Nobel Laureate who has spent a lifetime (he's 82 years old) studying why we make stupid decisions. Alright, that's actually a bit simplistic. He and his partner, Amos Tversky, spent their entire careers studying how we decide things.In this book, Kahneman asks us to imagine that our minds are actually two distinct beings - beings that he (and other economists and psychologists) refer to as 'System 1' and 'System 2'. ""... I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make."" - Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 13). I would describe the 'two agents' as follows: System 1 is intuitive, emotional, artistic, imaginative, creative, spontaneous, forgetful, vain, superstitious, illogical, and capricious. System 2 is logical, deliberative, suspicious, wary, calculating, practical, attentive, just, predictable, and (unfortunately) indolent.Now, when you think about it, this internal dynamic is not really a new discovery. The innate dichotomy of the human mind has been a source of introspection, conversation, speculation, and proselytization for thousands of years. What makes this book different than the rest, though, is the lack of condemnation of either of the Systems of thought. Instead of venerating one and vilifying the other, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" focuses on the dynamic between the two systems of thought and shows how, if we understand and accept ourselves fully, we can make full use of the best aspects of our two selves and avoid the less desirable aspects.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is full to the brim with statistics and survey results and laborious studies and quotes from esoteric scientific papers. As such, I found it a very challenging read. Nonetheless, in spite of the difficult subject matter, Kahneman is able to keep it real. Real world anecdotes and easy to imagine thought experiments are woven into the narrative to help the lay person (like me) to more fully grok the subject matter. Additionally, each chapter sticks to one topic and ends with a summery that's designed to help the reader remember what was covered and to provide some simple ways that we can use the chapters lessons in our everyday lives. Theses summaries take the form ""Speaking of........) Here are some examples from the book:Chapter 1 - Speaking of System 1 and System 2 “He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.” “This was a pure System 1 response. She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.” “This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.”Chapter 5 -Speaking of Cognitive Ease""Let's not dismiss their business plan just because the font makes it hard to read.""""We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but let's think it through again.""""Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.""""I'm in a good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.""Chapter 36 - Speaking of Life as a Story “He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.” “The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.” “You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?” “She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”Chapter 37 - Speaking of Experienced Well-Being “The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.” “The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?” “Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.”Although the author didn't say anything in the book about spiritual growth, from my perspective, the entire book was a textbook on the subject of self mastery. I believe that it could be used in combination with specifically adapted meditation practices and lifestyle changes as primary source-book for a serious spiritual development class or group."
500,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57346995-lexy,3,I thought that this book was okay 
501,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9485245-prashant,5,"Thinking fast and slow is a book that came along in 2011 though I still feel that it’s one of the most relevant and important books of its times. Personally, for me, it’s one of those books where every time you read it, you are able to learn something new.Though there is a caveat: This is a book which will scare you the moment you will pick it, as it's a heavy book to read, though if you can fight back and finish the first 100 pages then I can assure you that the writing of Daniel Kanheman will be able to keep you intrigued in the book until you finish it. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.  Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Though we do need to talk a little about the author as well i.e. Daniel Kahneman, is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is seen by many as one of the world’s most important thinkers. So, If you are thinking, I am in sales and how would this book help in my subject then for your surprise, his research influences our daily lives in a big way, for example, he gives an example of a situation in which people who are risk-averse, becomes risky and vice versa. He helps us understand, how our minds work in perceiving a statement and how it influences our decisions. If you are feeling that I have a boring, normal job then why should I read this book- then it could help you understand when we should approach people to get a decision in our favor i.e. you should approach your boss for raise when his tummy is full and he is happy as that’s the time when people actually put their guards down and use their intuitions more than their brains.If you are a stock-broker then it gives the perfect advice to not follow your stocks on a regular basis and looking them only once a quarter to generate better returns. There are so many words of wisdom in this book that it’s difficult for me to capture all over here and I can assure you that it’s tougher to implement those in your life, ergo, I have decided to read this book every year and I feel that it’s definitely not a bad decision. The last section of the book explores the contrasting ‘selves’ embodied in every individual: the remembering self and the experiencing self. The remembering self refers to the aspect in our nature that evaluates episodes by the lasting memory they leave; the one that keeps track of goals and keeps mental accounts; that answers the question: how satisfied are you with your life? The experiencing self is the aspect that feels every moment; that evaluates pleasure and pain on the go. Interestingly, these two selves are in conflict. The remembering self overweights the end of an episode and is indifferent to duration; it often promotes actions based on the memory that will result. Paradoxically, people may prefer an experience that is more painful in aggregate sum than another simply as a result of it ending on a less painful note.Kahneman concludes that both selves are necessary for evaluating subjective wellbeing, as both give us important information. Focusing exclusively on one or the other therefore excludes an important aspect of wellbeing.This book succeeds in instilling an awareness of the many biases and heuristics that lead to errors of judgments and poor decision-making. Above all, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a highly enjoyable and informative read for anyone wanting an insight into the human mind. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."
502,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82596342-iman-shabani,5,"I still haven't read the whole book as most reviews mention the main topic could be said in a lot less pages without leaving out anything important, so I listened (and read) a couple of well-written summaries of it.However now that I'm done, and know what the book has to offer, I'm going to spend some more time on it and read it more thoroughly, maybe not very soon, considering its volume, but not-so-late either.I can recommend this book to you for sure, even if you're listening to only a summary of it. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."
503,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3279705-vivian-zhang,4,My goodness. I did not know our thoughts could be so contradictory!I definitely did not take the right type of notes while reading this book to best navigate how I will think in the future... would love to hear how others have internalized their lessons learned.
504,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,4,"Daniel Kahneman was one of my professor's phd advisor at Princeton, and you can tell. Before reading this book I had a chance to be part of all these tiny experiments and see on my own mind where I have a bias and where I naturally tend to use ""system 2"" for my own good. Like everyone else, I have my goods and bads too, and this book does a very good job to explain *why* one might respond in a particular way to a question, but I have no idea how to correct them besides trying hard to be careful - which contradicts the definition of a bias really, so maybe they're not fixable. Having been through many of the experiments in this book (as well as the ones in Choices, values & frames, which I plan to read as well soon), I'm now really glad that I postponed reading this by two years! (The size was initially overwhelming, but it turned out to be a very casual read)The book feels very cozy after having been through the experiments, but it's great nevertheless, regardless of this practical stuff. I do wish that more of those posting on fb 10 strong opinions on 10 different subjects / day would read it too :)Some of my favorite quotes:In 1955, as a twenty-one-year-old lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces, I was assigned to set up an interview system for the entire army. If you wonder why such a responsibility would be forced upon someone so young, bear in mind that the state of Israel itself was only seven years old at the time.Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgement is missing - what we see is all there is. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. [...] Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.""How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?"" The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the ""Moses illusion"". Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did."
505,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is a book I'm more glad I have read than I actually enjoyed reading it. My favorite passage, incidentally, came in the introduction, when the author describes his working relationship with a close collaborator and which I identified with strongly. Several other points I took away are as follows:--the difference between thinking actively and passively, and particularly, that active thinking affects behavior in other ways (making people more selfish, superficial, and sexist). I identify with this based on how people perceive me when I'm exceptionally busy.--the concept of ""what you see is all there is,"" and particularly of priming effects, and implicit influence of what's in front of you. (My boss seems especially vulnerable to this!) As well this makes me rededicate myself to the theory that you should hire people based on their resumes rather than interviews; or at the very least employ your judgment only after scoring candidates (or other things, it's relevant more broadly) on more objective metrics--a valuable construct in business, to postulate how things could go wrong, as a method to avoid groupthink, encourage creative thinking, and make sure opposing ideas are heard--the difference in risk aversion with respect to gains and losses...not taking good gambles, and preferring risky gambles to limit losses. The author points out that most people avoid this pitfall when the games are presented as one they would play multiple times, but also highlight that in life, any gamble is almost certainly one of many. However, despite this interesting research, I found this book rather dry, and I read almost exclusively non-fiction. As well, the author's many references to the influence of his work, his Nobel Prize, etc., grew old by the end. The format, of repeating the research results in several different ways, with somewhat cheesy examples at the end of each chapter, was a bit didactic for me. But I did learn a good amount. "
506,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8070622-adam-morva,5,"When I'm hungry I tend to make myself bigger servings of meals than I can comfortably eat, and I always want to buy more food and snacks in the supermarket than I need. We could call this a bias, I suppose. Some primal part of my mind gets bathed in hunger hormones and such, and it makes me do things I shouldn't be doing, and those things would make me fat, so I learned to control this hellish urge, and whenever I do the groceries hungry, I remind myself of this fact. Whenever I start a meal really hungry I pick less food than what my eyes desire, and even gulp down a glass of water in order to ease my sense of hunger a bit.Why do I tell you this?Because some reviewers have said that it's useless to read about our mental short circuits, because we can't possibly do anything about them.Wrong. We can!Identifying your biases and intellectual pitfalls is the first step to combating them.Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about much more nuanced, and much less obvious circuits of thinking, and boy, it talks about a lot of them. I fancy myself a skeptic, a scientist, a student of thinking, so I've already known about most of the topics this book touches, and while it is not a complete list of all our intellectual quirks, IT TOOK ME YEARS to learn about the ones found in the book. So dear potential reader, you are lucky, because thanks to this wonderful book, you get to learn about them in the space of a lazy weekend (499 pages).Whether you are a big time corporate fatcat, a teacher, or a soccer mom, you'll benefit greatly from keeping at least some of Kahneman's conclusions in mind, because you are human, and we humans need to learn how to think, because we tend to make all sorts of mistakes."
507,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013427-laura,4,"A groundbreaking book on the pitfalls of subconscious thought. Thinking, Fast and Slow is the product of new (at the time) research on quick, mostly subconscious, intuitive thought and deliberate, logical thought. The major insight from this book is the many, many ways that the intuition can be misled and provide one with faulty conclusions. This insight was most applicable to me as I consider my role on a book acquisition committee, as my team meets regularly to collectively decide which book proposals to accept and reject. There is immense potential for intuitive factors to weigh largely in these decisions as we make a long series of important decisions carefully but with necessary time restrictions. I strongly advise anyone in similar decision-making situations to read this book, or another book on this topic. It will give you good tools for careful thinking and for helping others avoid unwarranted conclusions. One reason you might choose not to read this book is that it is quite long and dedicates too much space to describing his research methodology. I would also have preferred more discussion of ways that a well-developed intuition can be an asset (though Kahnneman appropriately points out that awareness of intuition pitfalls can, over time, lead to better intuition). Another book I've read, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do does this well and would be a good companion or follow-up to this book."

Most of the books I give 4-star reviews to are well written and interesting, but not important per se, like Harry Potter or David McCulluogh's book on the building of the Panama Canal. No matter how good those books are, they're not exactly life changing. Thinking, Fast and Slow is well written and quite interesting, but beyond that I think it's an important book because it explains so much about how we think, why we make the choices we make, and how we can make better choices as well as help others to make better choices. As I read it I found myself thinking I need to read this about 10 times and take notes about how to apply it to my business, my family, and my other relationships. There is just so much useful stuff in the book. I could use it to change the language I use on my business website, I could use it to change how I communicate with my children, and I could use it to change how I interact with my spouse. There is so much knowledge packed into this, and I especially appreciate how, at the end of each chapter, Kahneman gives a few 1-2 sentence practical examples of how his research can be used in the real world."
509,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre,3,"I bought the audiobook for this after a reviewer of Chuck Klosterman's latest book drew a parallel with THINKING, FAST AND SLOW and OF COURSE both books have nothing to do with one another. How do I keep getting suckered into reading these books about cognitive biases and heuristics, I do not know. This one's pretty well made though and exposes a theory of two thought system: an intuitive one that takes instant decisions (like putting pants on in the morning) and hardwired to create coherence out of everything. It is this brain that scares people watching horror movies. There is also the second thought system that can very well override the first, which leads to conscious cognition. So that's cool and it's very enlightening to learn how to differentiate the two in your daily reactions.The book can't transcend its nature though as it plays it safe with its own scientific angle and ends up being just a list of situations where heuristics are involved. There are a lot of books like this available on the market albeit it is quite well done. It can get mind-numbing after a while and especially if you read the audiobook version like I did. Wanted to throw myself off a cliff after 15 or so hours."

I had put this in my every year to-read-list for 3 consecutive years and the hope of finishing it had been thin. This time last year I picked up Leonardo da Vinci and it dragged on for 6 months. I learned a valuable lesson from then on, that’s it’s okay to have an affair with books. While reading this book, I've swept through a whole YA Fantasy series and even started another book. What kept me afloat was a simple rule, I only had to read this book 1 hour every day, then I could be off to read whatever I want. There were days my will power was too low that I might give myself a break by immersing on a romance novel and come back fresher the next day.   2 months came by like a rush, and now I feel sorry this book ended so soon.    Why do we need to read this book when we can read a summary version of it online and eagerly tell anyone who asks that this book was a-okay? Because you read to understand. Only when you can summarise this book from your own understanding of it can you know that it will stick with you and be of help in your life for a long time. Please do not read this if you have no interest in human behaviors, you do not really care why we do what we do, or how we make mistakes, how we come up with decisions. That time can be well spent doing many things else but reading Thinking, Fast and SlowHowever if you need to understand this fast for work or any project, you can read 2 of the authors’ researches that built up this book, then start reading the book when you feel up for the commitment.And now the question is, when will I finish Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder?

511,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"My favorite passage: ""When I asked my large undergraduate class in some indignation, 'Do you realize that you have violated an elementary logical rule?' someone in the back row shouted, 'So what?'"" (p.158).Most relevant for me were the many examples of the striking differences in between subjects and within subjects experiments. So, for example, when subjects were asked to judge the value of the following sets of dinnerware presented together, they judged set A as more valuable:SET A: 40 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good condition8 cups, 2 of them broken8 saucers, 7 of them brokenSET B: 24 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good conditionBut when subjects saw only one or the other of the two sets, they judged SET B to be worth more than SET A. Why? When presented with the sets together, they could make a comparative judgment and see that SET A contained more items in good shape than set B. But seen individually, they make a snap judgment of average value of the items in the set, which is higher in SET B than in SET A. I couldn't help but think about the relevance of this idea when you're putting your CV together. Say there are two candidates for a job. Candidate A has two publications in really good journals. Candidate B has two publications in equally good journals, and also two publications in unrefereed conference proceedings or journals edited by her friends. Considered side by side, maybe Candidate B has a slight advantage over A, but considered individually, Candidate A looks better. The average level of her publications is higher than B's. Maybe I should prune my list of conference presentations in light of this finding.Kahneman says (p.354) that ""We normally experience life in the between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent..."" and that in making decisions we should encourage consideration of ""broad context"", which includes alternatives (p.361). This is clearly relevant to debates about contextualism and invariantism, conversational context, and the standard linguistic methodology of eliciting intuitions from subjects about individual cases isolated from contrasting cases.

Maybe it's my problem. Maybe I just think differently. I suspect this book is written for left brained thinkers. I am very much a right brained thinker. Consequently, the author would pose a problem, assume the reader came to a certain conclusion, then built his thesis on the conclusion he assumes the reader arrived at. The problem was I never I arrived at his preconceived conclusions. Maybe because he assumes our brains all work a certain way. Ironic at that.Here's some examples. He gives a problem and tells us not to try to solve it but listen to our intuition:A ball and a bat cost $1.10The bat cost one dollar more than the bat.How much does the ball cost?Then he goes on to explain that the number that came to our mind was 10 cents because the ""distinctive mark of an easy puzzle is intuitive, appealing and wrong."" Then he informs us that the actual cost of the ball is 5 cents.But that is not how I read the problem. And since I didn't know where he was going with the puzzle, I assumed he was testing our ability to catch logical fallacies.When the statement said a ball and a bat cost $1.10, I assumed that he meant they EACH cost $1.10. After all he did not say the sum of the cost or that ""together"" they cost. I then went on to conclude the next two sentences were wrong.So does that make me stupid?Here's another one: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?According to the author the answer is determined whether the reader will remember that Detroit is in Michigan.OK. But the question was not whether Michigan has a high rate of murders, or higher than other states. The question was what number of murders occur in Michigan. Isn't that what ""how many murders"" means?My answer was, how the heck do I know the number of murders that occur anywhere without consulting a reliable census source?Needless to say I found this book frustrating and not a very reliable source for learning about cognitive functions."
513,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,5,"Finishing this book means I completed my 2017 Reading Challenge here on Goodreads. It also means I finished a book that I bought in 2015 ""because it was a book one ought to read"". I couldn't voluntarily take it off the shelf to read. What got me to read and finish and enjoy this book was reading it with some colleagues at work. The issue came up during a training class - I actually do not remember how - and several of us decided that we would read a section of the book every two weeks. There were five sections so we would finish in approximately 10 weeks. This way, there was room for busy events at work that could keep us from reading or the events of our own lives. The period of two weeks wasn't too long so that fast readers would get impatient or bored, or that anyone would forget anything. We met for only 30 minutes - either during lunch or a short time after where we each stated one thing we liked and one thing we disliked, after which we could have a free discussion. Stating one thing we liked or disliked was merely a device for ensuring all could be heard and to try to structure our thoughts in the short time frame.It worked. But I am not finished with the book. Oh yes, I read the book. However, this is not a quick read that you put back on the shelf and ignore. There are some heavy-duty thoughts in here that I, for one, will need to lean on for a long time when referencing points during a discussion. Also, some parts were a little over my head - I haven't studied probability so I lacked the vocabulary to grasp those areas well. However, to Kahneman's praise, his writing meant that I could plow through those bits and still get his point.I have already been recommending this book to others. While carrying it around at work for our meetings, some people I knew would say ""oh, excellent book"", so it almost became a secret handshake. :)All in all, I had a good experience reading and digesting this book. :)"
514,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"If you want to read a layman's introduction into the psychology of decision making, Kahneman's book is probably the best. Dan Ariely has written similar books, but his are kind of jokey, lightweight, and unnuanced. Thinking, Fast and Slow is unlike most bestsellers in that it assumes the reader is intelligent and isn't on the beach or skimming. It's not particularly engaging - Kahneman's writing is on the dry and pedantic side - but this book is carefully written, and packed with fifty years of work in the field of decision making. While of course Kahneman tends to focus on his own research, he is very generous in citing and lauding the work of others. In a lot of ways, this book is a very impressive achievement.Unlike Ariely, Kahneman doesn't emphasize the follies in the way our brain works. Rather he very simply, plainly, and convincingly shows how we as humans tend to go from point A to point B in our thinking. The examples he uses are very easy to grasp if you are a careful reader. I'd say, using the parlance of Kahneman, that if you have a well developed System 2 - patience and a love of slow thinking - and an interest in how humans think you'll enjoy this book. It's probably also true that the kind of person who'll find Thinking, Fast and Slow interesting will consistently find that he or she is in the minority population in the examples cited. At least that's what I found. If Kahneman says something like 84 percent will say A and 16 percent will say B in response to a question, I'll be in the 16 percent. Finding myself consistently in the minority was an illuminating thing, actually. I've always ascribed my tendency for oddball thinking to my strange background of growing up around war survivors and Hassidic Jews. Nope. Now I realize that I'm just a System 2 kind of guy."
515,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"4Thinking, Fast and Slow for the better part is a solid and interesting read. My central complaint is the repetitive later sections of the book. Apart from that this is a must-read book for everybody. Understanding the way you think is worth the early chapters, and it's quite a simplistic design for consumption. It does get heavy in the latter half of the book, and to be honest I was quite bored here myself. But, make no mistake, Daniel Kahneman has created something unique and informative. The structure of the book was interesting, with the common stage 1 & 2 mapped throughout. I will say this, you won't finish the book and not understand these two meanings. There feels like a repeat of information here, but there is a lot to digest. I quite liked the idea of the book and I think structurally it's okay. Some of the information should've been condensed at times, but more might be something the majority of readers wanted. I enjoy reading books like this to understand the why. This book explains so much and that's why I continued to read and finish it. Why the 4?I can understand why certain reviews have marked it tedious. I get that. I did found it tough to read in that final 100 pages, but I was more engaged with finishing and information overload. This is a good book. The author has thrown in so much, so in hindsight I would recommend slowly digesting if you're allowed. That comment is more to the owner of the book, the library reader has to make the call based on the amount of people in the waiting list. I discovered a lot here, and as creatures of habit, you will notice these examples day after day. You can't unread what you've learned. I recommend reading this and not force reading it like I did. It's a book to slow down and read from time to time. "
516,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33537328-gheorghina,5,"This is one of the best books I have read. And for sure it is one that I will return to. I would just like to be able to memorize it all.The insight of making us understand how the human mind works and why we make some choices, is just brilliant.The only regret I have is that even if you read and understand things， the way our brain is wired， its software， can not be easily changed. This means that even if you are aware of things， it does not mean you are not susceptible for falling into traps. I cannot copy here the entire book content， but I will give an example:<“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion”. Moses took no animals into the ark;Noah did. The Moses illusion is explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context， and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him， but the mention of his name is not surprising. It also helps that Moses and Noah have the same vowel sound and number of syllables， so you unconsciously detect associative coherence between “Moses” and “ark” and so quickly accept the question. Replace Moses with George W Bush in this sentence and you will have a poor political joke but no illusion.>"
517,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16459651-allie,1,"This book was repetitive and tedious. I had to read it for a course, and I would definitely not have bothered otherwise. Within the first part of this book you've experienced all there is to experience. Kahneman goes through this book repeating the same theories in different ways again and again. Every now and then there will be a brief interlude of him bragging about his Nobel Prize or some other research he did that doesn't fully apply. This book got off to quite a bad start with me as it is 100% directed at Americans. I felt like many of the examples just confused the points more as they were based on knowledge that I, as an Australian, do not have just generally. He also frequently gives an example of an effect and then says ""You thought this"". A majority of the time though I did not think what he claimed, making me frustrated at the writing and the theory he then presented. I feel like this book was very much a cocky piece of writing in which the author frequently claimed that as a population we're pretty stupid. I can understand this was not his intention, but it came across that way. If you do want to read this book, I suggest a brief skimming of the conclusions section in the back. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. "
518,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7541671-ariadna73,5,Here is my comment in Spanish: http://bit.ly/XhWvoUDaniel Kahneman is a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. Curiously; he only devotes one chapter of this book to his field of expertise (but it is a heck of a chapter; I tell ya) He explains how our brains think in two ways: slow and fast. Our fast brain help us make quick decisions so we don't get ran over by cars or hit by balls; or stand up for days on the supermarket isles deciding which product to buy. The second system thinks more slowly and that is the one that help us make the most important decisions in our lives like to whom we will get married and for whom we should work. Well; those two systems trend to interact and screw up each other; so this is why the world is so screwed up. The book is pretty scientific; and dense. I understood probably a third of it; but I liked chap. 1 and the conclussions; and I honestly tried the statistics one (chap 3;4) and the economics ones (5); but as I said it was difficult. I think this book would be very good as an object of study in specialized classes. I really liked it. I gave it 9 weeks of my time. It is really good.
519,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16430203-swaroop,4,"This is a great book to read for anyone with a passing interest in behavioral economics. It's significantly more detailed and scientific than other pop-science books in the genre by Malcolm Gladwell et al.You can break up the book into 3 parts.In the first part, he dismantles the rational choice theory. Kahneman says he is not out to dismantle classical economic theory, according to him, he is not questioning the rational agent theory, he is just establishing that humans are not rational agents. (Cool story bro.)He then proceeds to dismantle another popular assumption, that humans always try to maximize utility. The third part of the book, about the 'science of happiness' was easily the least interesting part of the book. Coincidentally, this part of the book comprises mostly of work done after Tversky's death. My biggest problem with this book and many other books of this genre is the constant repetition. Frankly, this book is much better than others in this respect. That only speaks to how absurd other books are.This was a fantastic read but I think I am done with books like this for a while."

I had put this book down when I was younger and determined to take up this challenge for myself, I decided to read 50 pages per day years later. And I completed it within a month! Undoubtedly, my most difficult and yet enriching, it almost felt like attending economics classes and feeling doubly intelligent while reading this one. Daniel Kahneman is a Genius...He talks about how our mind processes things, how judgements happen and why we jump to conclusions, why we always chose the easy way to do things, risk luck and intuition and many more theories. ..Don’t buy this one if you’re looking for an easy-breezy read, but if you’re willing to dive into making your brain take the harder way into understanding these concepts, on Economics and Behavioural Psychology with interesting case studies, don’t miss this one written by a Nobel Laureate ⭐️"

I had initially dismissed this book without reading it, thinking it would be about business/economics (I’d blame it on the blurb found on the cover, something from the author of Freakonomics). I read it because I found out it’s a pretty famous book on Goodreads.com I enjoyed parts of the book; I’d say 3/5th of it. I had skimmed through mostly the rest of it as it was too technical. The book is a very deep and technical study (as far as I’m concerned) on behavioural sciences and economics. But whatever I did read, it was excellent. The use of examples and sample question scenarios helped in understanding how the brain works and how & why we think the way we think. It is not a light read; it required me to sit up and actively understand it. Not really my type of a book, and I probably wouldn’t want to read anything similar. "

It will make you more aware of your own biases, though not necessarily change the way you make decisions. As you'll find out, most biases are hard to overcome even when you're aware of them.The book describes how the human mind employs two modes of thinking - Fast (unconscious, impulsive) and Slow (conscious, deliberate), the limitations of this system and implications in various fields - behavioral economics, education, health, happiness, management, etc.Overall, this is a great read and an eye opener."

Although I appreciate the detail in which the author goes into, at times it was a bit much for me, which made it a sluggish read at times.I did like how Kahneman, to demonstrate concepts, asks you questions or has you look at pictures, and then explains what was occurring in your mind during that exercise.

Drawing on knowledge acquired from years of research in cognitive and social psychology, Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Daniel Kahneman delivers his magnum opus on Behavioral Economics. This excellent book focuses on the three key sets of distinctions: between the automatic System 1 and the effortful System 2, between the conception of agents in classical economics and in behavioral economics, and between the experiencing and the remembering selves. This enlightening 512-page book is composed of thirty-eight chapters and broken out by the following five Parts: Part I. Two Systems, Part II. Heuristics and Biases, Part III. Overconfidence, Part IV. Choices, and Part V. Two Selves.Positives:1.	Award-winning research. A masterpiece of behavioral economics knowledge. Overall accessible.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of a master. How the mind works. The biases of intuition, judgment, and decision making. 3.	Excellent format. Each chapter is well laid out and ends with a Speaking of section that summarizes the content via quotes.4.	A great job of defining and summarizing new terms. ""In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."" 5.	Supports findings with countless research. Provides many accessible and practical examples that help readers understand the insightful conclusions.6.	A great job of letting us what we know and to what degree. ""It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work.""7.	You are guaranteed to learn something. Countless tidbits of knowledge throughout this insightful book and how it applies to the read world. ""The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.""8.	The differences of Systems 1 and 2 and how they function with one another. ""System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."" ""System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.""9.	Important recurring concepts like WYSIATI (What You See Is All There IS). ""You surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle.""10.	Understanding heuristics and biases. ""The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.""11.	Paradoxical results for your enjoyment. ""People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it.""12.	Understanding how our brains work, ""The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.""13.	Wisdom. ""'Risk' does not exist 'out there,' independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as 'real risk' or 'objective risk.'"" Bonus. ""To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.""14.	You will learn lessons that are practical. ""Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.""15.	An interesting look at overconfidence. ""Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."" ""Remember this rule: intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.""16.	Have you ever had to plan anything in your life? Meet the planning fallacy. ""This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an “outside view” and is the cure to the planning fallacy.""17.	A very interesting look at Econs and Humans. ""Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices.""18.	 Prospect theory explained. ""The pain of losing $900 is more than 90% of the pain of losing $1,000. These two insights are the essence of prospect theory.""19.	Avoiding poor psychology. ""The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.""20.	Great stuff on well being. 21.	An excellent Conclusions chapter that ties the book up comprehensively.Negatives:1.	Notes not linked up.2.	No formal separate bibliography.3.	Requires an investment of time. Thankfully, the book is worthy of your time.4.	The book overall is very well-written and accessible but some topics are challenging. 5.	Wanted more clarification on how Bayes's rules work.In summary, a masterpiece on behavioral economics. Dr. Kahneman shares his years of research and provides readers with an education on how the mind works. It requires an investment of your time but it so well worth it.

Overall, I think the book is a decent introduction for someone who is interested in why we make the choices we do, who doesn't already have a grasp of the theories or recently published studies in psychology and economics. That said, if you do, I don't think you'd find this book as interesting or helpful in extending your knowledge. Though by no means an expert in either, I have followed both fields, particularly where they intersect and have to do with consumer decision-making, and subsequently felt the book dragged on in parts and at times, even felt a little dated.Overall, a very solid 4* read.

""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is an amazing book, but it's not a casual read. That being said, I think it's one of the most important books of our time.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is a book about how we, as humans, make decisions. The author, Daniel Kahneman is an Economist and Nobel Laureate who has spent a lifetime (he's 82 years old) studying why we make stupid decisions. Alright, that's actually a bit simplistic. He and his partner, Amos Tversky, spent their entire careers studying how we decide things.In this book, Kahneman asks us to imagine that our minds are actually two distinct beings - beings that he (and other economists and psychologists) refer to as 'System 1' and 'System 2'. ""... I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make."" - Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 13). I would describe the 'two agents' as follows: System 1 is intuitive, emotional, artistic, imaginative, creative, spontaneous, forgetful, vain, superstitious, illogical, and capricious. System 2 is logical, deliberative, suspicious, wary, calculating, practical, attentive, just, predictable, and (unfortunately) indolent.Now, when you think about it, this internal dynamic is not really a new discovery. The innate dichotomy of the human mind has been a source of introspection, conversation, speculation, and proselytization for thousands of years. What makes this book different than the rest, though, is the lack of condemnation of either of the Systems of thought. Instead of venerating one and vilifying the other, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" focuses on the dynamic between the two systems of thought and shows how, if we understand and accept ourselves fully, we can make full use of the best aspects of our two selves and avoid the less desirable aspects.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is full to the brim with statistics and survey results and laborious studies and quotes from esoteric scientific papers. As such, I found it a very challenging read. Nonetheless, in spite of the difficult subject matter, Kahneman is able to keep it real. Real world anecdotes and easy to imagine thought experiments are woven into the narrative to help the lay person (like me) to more fully grok the subject matter. Additionally, each chapter sticks to one topic and ends with a summery that's designed to help the reader remember what was covered and to provide some simple ways that we can use the chapters lessons in our everyday lives. Theses summaries take the form ""Speaking of........) Here are some examples from the book:Chapter 1 - Speaking of System 1 and System 2 “He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.” “This was a pure System 1 response. She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.” “This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.”Chapter 5 -Speaking of Cognitive Ease""Let's not dismiss their business plan just because the font makes it hard to read.""""We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but let's think it through again.""""Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.""""I'm in a good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.""Chapter 36 - Speaking of Life as a Story “He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.” “The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.” “You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?” “She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”Chapter 37 - Speaking of Experienced Well-Being “The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.” “The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?” “Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.”Although the author didn't say anything in the book about spiritual growth, from my perspective, the entire book was a textbook on the subject of self mastery. I believe that it could be used in combination with specifically adapted meditation practices and lifestyle changes as primary source-book for a serious spiritual development class or group."

531,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9485245-prashant,5,"Thinking fast and slow is a book that came along in 2011 though I still feel that it’s one of the most relevant and important books of its times. Personally, for me, it’s one of those books where every time you read it, you are able to learn something new.Though there is a caveat: This is a book which will scare you the moment you will pick it, as it's a heavy book to read, though if you can fight back and finish the first 100 pages then I can assure you that the writing of Daniel Kanheman will be able to keep you intrigued in the book until you finish it. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.  Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Though we do need to talk a little about the author as well i.e. Daniel Kahneman, is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is seen by many as one of the world’s most important thinkers. So, If you are thinking, I am in sales and how would this book help in my subject then for your surprise, his research influences our daily lives in a big way, for example, he gives an example of a situation in which people who are risk-averse, becomes risky and vice versa. He helps us understand, how our minds work in perceiving a statement and how it influences our decisions. If you are feeling that I have a boring, normal job then why should I read this book- then it could help you understand when we should approach people to get a decision in our favor i.e. you should approach your boss for raise when his tummy is full and he is happy as that’s the time when people actually put their guards down and use their intuitions more than their brains.If you are a stock-broker then it gives the perfect advice to not follow your stocks on a regular basis and looking them only once a quarter to generate better returns. There are so many words of wisdom in this book that it’s difficult for me to capture all over here and I can assure you that it’s tougher to implement those in your life, ergo, I have decided to read this book every year and I feel that it’s definitely not a bad decision. The last section of the book explores the contrasting ‘selves’ embodied in every individual: the remembering self and the experiencing self. The remembering self refers to the aspect in our nature that evaluates episodes by the lasting memory they leave; the one that keeps track of goals and keeps mental accounts; that answers the question: how satisfied are you with your life? The experiencing self is the aspect that feels every moment; that evaluates pleasure and pain on the go. Interestingly, these two selves are in conflict. The remembering self overweights the end of an episode and is indifferent to duration; it often promotes actions based on the memory that will result. Paradoxically, people may prefer an experience that is more painful in aggregate sum than another simply as a result of it ending on a less painful note.Kahneman concludes that both selves are necessary for evaluating subjective wellbeing, as both give us important information. Focusing exclusively on one or the other therefore excludes an important aspect of wellbeing.This book succeeds in instilling an awareness of the many biases and heuristics that lead to errors of judgments and poor decision-making. Above all, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a highly enjoyable and informative read for anyone wanting an insight into the human mind. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."

Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."
533,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3279705-vivian-zhang,4,My goodness. I did not know our thoughts could be so contradictory!I definitely did not take the right type of notes while reading this book to best navigate how I will think in the future... would love to hear how others have internalized their lessons learned.
534,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,4,"Daniel Kahneman was one of my professor's phd advisor at Princeton, and you can tell. Before reading this book I had a chance to be part of all these tiny experiments and see on my own mind where I have a bias and where I naturally tend to use ""system 2"" for my own good. Like everyone else, I have my goods and bads too, and this book does a very good job to explain *why* one might respond in a particular way to a question, but I have no idea how to correct them besides trying hard to be careful - which contradicts the definition of a bias really, so maybe they're not fixable. Having been through many of the experiments in this book (as well as the ones in Choices, values & frames, which I plan to read as well soon), I'm now really glad that I postponed reading this by two years! (The size was initially overwhelming, but it turned out to be a very casual read)The book feels very cozy after having been through the experiments, but it's great nevertheless, regardless of this practical stuff. I do wish that more of those posting on fb 10 strong opinions on 10 different subjects / day would read it too :)Some of my favorite quotes:In 1955, as a twenty-one-year-old lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces, I was assigned to set up an interview system for the entire army. If you wonder why such a responsibility would be forced upon someone so young, bear in mind that the state of Israel itself was only seven years old at the time.Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgement is missing - what we see is all there is. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. [...] Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.""How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?"" The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the ""Moses illusion"". Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did."
535,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is a book I'm more glad I have read than I actually enjoyed reading it. My favorite passage, incidentally, came in the introduction, when the author describes his working relationship with a close collaborator and which I identified with strongly. Several other points I took away are as follows:--the difference between thinking actively and passively, and particularly, that active thinking affects behavior in other ways (making people more selfish, superficial, and sexist). I identify with this based on how people perceive me when I'm exceptionally busy.--the concept of ""what you see is all there is,"" and particularly of priming effects, and implicit influence of what's in front of you. (My boss seems especially vulnerable to this!) As well this makes me rededicate myself to the theory that you should hire people based on their resumes rather than interviews; or at the very least employ your judgment only after scoring candidates (or other things, it's relevant more broadly) on more objective metrics--a valuable construct in business, to postulate how things could go wrong, as a method to avoid groupthink, encourage creative thinking, and make sure opposing ideas are heard--the difference in risk aversion with respect to gains and losses...not taking good gambles, and preferring risky gambles to limit losses. The author points out that most people avoid this pitfall when the games are presented as one they would play multiple times, but also highlight that in life, any gamble is almost certainly one of many. However, despite this interesting research, I found this book rather dry, and I read almost exclusively non-fiction. As well, the author's many references to the influence of his work, his Nobel Prize, etc., grew old by the end. The format, of repeating the research results in several different ways, with somewhat cheesy examples at the end of each chapter, was a bit didactic for me. But I did learn a good amount. "
536,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8070622-adam-morva,5,"When I'm hungry I tend to make myself bigger servings of meals than I can comfortably eat, and I always want to buy more food and snacks in the supermarket than I need. We could call this a bias, I suppose. Some primal part of my mind gets bathed in hunger hormones and such, and it makes me do things I shouldn't be doing, and those things would make me fat, so I learned to control this hellish urge, and whenever I do the groceries hungry, I remind myself of this fact. Whenever I start a meal really hungry I pick less food than what my eyes desire, and even gulp down a glass of water in order to ease my sense of hunger a bit.Why do I tell you this?Because some reviewers have said that it's useless to read about our mental short circuits, because we can't possibly do anything about them.Wrong. We can!Identifying your biases and intellectual pitfalls is the first step to combating them.Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about much more nuanced, and much less obvious circuits of thinking, and boy, it talks about a lot of them. I fancy myself a skeptic, a scientist, a student of thinking, so I've already known about most of the topics this book touches, and while it is not a complete list of all our intellectual quirks, IT TOOK ME YEARS to learn about the ones found in the book. So dear potential reader, you are lucky, because thanks to this wonderful book, you get to learn about them in the space of a lazy weekend (499 pages).Whether you are a big time corporate fatcat, a teacher, or a soccer mom, you'll benefit greatly from keeping at least some of Kahneman's conclusions in mind, because you are human, and we humans need to learn how to think, because we tend to make all sorts of mistakes."
537,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013427-laura,4,"A groundbreaking book on the pitfalls of subconscious thought. Thinking, Fast and Slow is the product of new (at the time) research on quick, mostly subconscious, intuitive thought and deliberate, logical thought. The major insight from this book is the many, many ways that the intuition can be misled and provide one with faulty conclusions. This insight was most applicable to me as I consider my role on a book acquisition committee, as my team meets regularly to collectively decide which book proposals to accept and reject. There is immense potential for intuitive factors to weigh largely in these decisions as we make a long series of important decisions carefully but with necessary time restrictions. I strongly advise anyone in similar decision-making situations to read this book, or another book on this topic. It will give you good tools for careful thinking and for helping others avoid unwarranted conclusions. One reason you might choose not to read this book is that it is quite long and dedicates too much space to describing his research methodology. I would also have preferred more discussion of ways that a well-developed intuition can be an asset (though Kahnneman appropriately points out that awareness of intuition pitfalls can, over time, lead to better intuition). Another book I've read, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do does this well and would be a good companion or follow-up to this book."

Most of the books I give 4-star reviews to are well written and interesting, but not important per se, like Harry Potter or David McCulluogh's book on the building of the Panama Canal. No matter how good those books are, they're not exactly life changing. Thinking, Fast and Slow is well written and quite interesting, but beyond that I think it's an important book because it explains so much about how we think, why we make the choices we make, and how we can make better choices as well as help others to make better choices. As I read it I found myself thinking I need to read this about 10 times and take notes about how to apply it to my business, my family, and my other relationships. There is just so much useful stuff in the book. I could use it to change the language I use on my business website, I could use it to change how I communicate with my children, and I could use it to change how I interact with my spouse. There is so much knowledge packed into this, and I especially appreciate how, at the end of each chapter, Kahneman gives a few 1-2 sentence practical examples of how his research can be used in the real world."
539,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre,3,"I bought the audiobook for this after a reviewer of Chuck Klosterman's latest book drew a parallel with THINKING, FAST AND SLOW and OF COURSE both books have nothing to do with one another. How do I keep getting suckered into reading these books about cognitive biases and heuristics, I do not know. This one's pretty well made though and exposes a theory of two thought system: an intuitive one that takes instant decisions (like putting pants on in the morning) and hardwired to create coherence out of everything. It is this brain that scares people watching horror movies. There is also the second thought system that can very well override the first, which leads to conscious cognition. So that's cool and it's very enlightening to learn how to differentiate the two in your daily reactions.The book can't transcend its nature though as it plays it safe with its own scientific angle and ends up being just a list of situations where heuristics are involved. There are a lot of books like this available on the market albeit it is quite well done. It can get mind-numbing after a while and especially if you read the audiobook version like I did. Wanted to throw myself off a cliff after 15 or so hours."

I had put this in my every year to-read-list for 3 consecutive years and the hope of finishing it had been thin. This time last year I picked up Leonardo da Vinci and it dragged on for 6 months. I learned a valuable lesson from then on, that’s it’s okay to have an affair with books. While reading this book, I've swept through a whole YA Fantasy series and even started another book. What kept me afloat was a simple rule, I only had to read this book 1 hour every day, then I could be off to read whatever I want. There were days my will power was too low that I might give myself a break by immersing on a romance novel and come back fresher the next day.   2 months came by like a rush, and now I feel sorry this book ended so soon.    Why do we need to read this book when we can read a summary version of it online and eagerly tell anyone who asks that this book was a-okay? Because you read to understand. Only when you can summarise this book from your own understanding of it can you know that it will stick with you and be of help in your life for a long time. Please do not read this if you have no interest in human behaviors, you do not really care why we do what we do, or how we make mistakes, how we come up with decisions. That time can be well spent doing many things else but reading Thinking, Fast and SlowHowever if you need to understand this fast for work or any project, you can read 2 of the authors’ researches that built up this book, then start reading the book when you feel up for the commitment.And now the question is, when will I finish Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder? "
541,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"My favorite passage: ""When I asked my large undergraduate class in some indignation, 'Do you realize that you have violated an elementary logical rule?' someone in the back row shouted, 'So what?'"" (p.158).Most relevant for me were the many examples of the striking differences in between subjects and within subjects experiments. So, for example, when subjects were asked to judge the value of the following sets of dinnerware presented together, they judged set A as more valuable:SET A: 40 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good condition8 cups, 2 of them broken8 saucers, 7 of them brokenSET B: 24 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good conditionBut when subjects saw only one or the other of the two sets, they judged SET B to be worth more than SET A. Why? When presented with the sets together, they could make a comparative judgment and see that SET A contained more items in good shape than set B. But seen individually, they make a snap judgment of average value of the items in the set, which is higher in SET B than in SET A. I couldn't help but think about the relevance of this idea when you're putting your CV together. Say there are two candidates for a job. Candidate A has two publications in really good journals. Candidate B has two publications in equally good journals, and also two publications in unrefereed conference proceedings or journals edited by her friends. Considered side by side, maybe Candidate B has a slight advantage over A, but considered individually, Candidate A looks better. The average level of her publications is higher than B's. Maybe I should prune my list of conference presentations in light of this finding.Kahneman says (p.354) that ""We normally experience life in the between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent..."" and that in making decisions we should encourage consideration of ""broad context"", which includes alternatives (p.361). This is clearly relevant to debates about contextualism and invariantism, conversational context, and the standard linguistic methodology of eliciting intuitions from subjects about individual cases isolated from contrasting cases.

Maybe it's my problem. Maybe I just think differently. I suspect this book is written for left brained thinkers. I am very much a right brained thinker. Consequently, the author would pose a problem, assume the reader came to a certain conclusion, then built his thesis on the conclusion he assumes the reader arrived at. The problem was I never I arrived at his preconceived conclusions. Maybe because he assumes our brains all work a certain way. Ironic at that.Here's some examples. He gives a problem and tells us not to try to solve it but listen to our intuition:A ball and a bat cost $1.10The bat cost one dollar more than the bat.How much does the ball cost?Then he goes on to explain that the number that came to our mind was 10 cents because the ""distinctive mark of an easy puzzle is intuitive, appealing and wrong."" Then he informs us that the actual cost of the ball is 5 cents.But that is not how I read the problem. And since I didn't know where he was going with the puzzle, I assumed he was testing our ability to catch logical fallacies.When the statement said a ball and a bat cost $1.10, I assumed that he meant they EACH cost $1.10. After all he did not say the sum of the cost or that ""together"" they cost. I then went on to conclude the next two sentences were wrong.So does that make me stupid?Here's another one: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?According to the author the answer is determined whether the reader will remember that Detroit is in Michigan.OK. But the question was not whether Michigan has a high rate of murders, or higher than other states. The question was what number of murders occur in Michigan. Isn't that what ""how many murders"" means?My answer was, how the heck do I know the number of murders that occur anywhere without consulting a reliable census source?Needless to say I found this book frustrating and not a very reliable source for learning about cognitive functions."
543,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,5,"Finishing this book means I completed my 2017 Reading Challenge here on Goodreads. It also means I finished a book that I bought in 2015 ""because it was a book one ought to read"". I couldn't voluntarily take it off the shelf to read. What got me to read and finish and enjoy this book was reading it with some colleagues at work. The issue came up during a training class - I actually do not remember how - and several of us decided that we would read a section of the book every two weeks. There were five sections so we would finish in approximately 10 weeks. This way, there was room for busy events at work that could keep us from reading or the events of our own lives. The period of two weeks wasn't too long so that fast readers would get impatient or bored, or that anyone would forget anything. We met for only 30 minutes - either during lunch or a short time after where we each stated one thing we liked and one thing we disliked, after which we could have a free discussion. Stating one thing we liked or disliked was merely a device for ensuring all could be heard and to try to structure our thoughts in the short time frame.It worked. But I am not finished with the book. Oh yes, I read the book. However, this is not a quick read that you put back on the shelf and ignore. There are some heavy-duty thoughts in here that I, for one, will need to lean on for a long time when referencing points during a discussion. Also, some parts were a little over my head - I haven't studied probability so I lacked the vocabulary to grasp those areas well. However, to Kahneman's praise, his writing meant that I could plow through those bits and still get his point.I have already been recommending this book to others. While carrying it around at work for our meetings, some people I knew would say ""oh, excellent book"", so it almost became a secret handshake. :)All in all, I had a good experience reading and digesting this book. :)"
544,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"If you want to read a layman's introduction into the psychology of decision making, Kahneman's book is probably the best. Dan Ariely has written similar books, but his are kind of jokey, lightweight, and unnuanced. Thinking, Fast and Slow is unlike most bestsellers in that it assumes the reader is intelligent and isn't on the beach or skimming. It's not particularly engaging - Kahneman's writing is on the dry and pedantic side - but this book is carefully written, and packed with fifty years of work in the field of decision making. While of course Kahneman tends to focus on his own research, he is very generous in citing and lauding the work of others. In a lot of ways, this book is a very impressive achievement.Unlike Ariely, Kahneman doesn't emphasize the follies in the way our brain works. Rather he very simply, plainly, and convincingly shows how we as humans tend to go from point A to point B in our thinking. The examples he uses are very easy to grasp if you are a careful reader. I'd say, using the parlance of Kahneman, that if you have a well developed System 2 - patience and a love of slow thinking - and an interest in how humans think you'll enjoy this book. It's probably also true that the kind of person who'll find Thinking, Fast and Slow interesting will consistently find that he or she is in the minority population in the examples cited. At least that's what I found. If Kahneman says something like 84 percent will say A and 16 percent will say B in response to a question, I'll be in the 16 percent. Finding myself consistently in the minority was an illuminating thing, actually. I've always ascribed my tendency for oddball thinking to my strange background of growing up around war survivors and Hassidic Jews. Nope. Now I realize that I'm just a System 2 kind of guy."
545,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"4Thinking, Fast and Slow for the better part is a solid and interesting read. My central complaint is the repetitive later sections of the book. Apart from that this is a must-read book for everybody. Understanding the way you think is worth the early chapters, and it's quite a simplistic design for consumption. It does get heavy in the latter half of the book, and to be honest I was quite bored here myself. But, make no mistake, Daniel Kahneman has created something unique and informative. The structure of the book was interesting, with the common stage 1 & 2 mapped throughout. I will say this, you won't finish the book and not understand these two meanings. There feels like a repeat of information here, but there is a lot to digest. I quite liked the idea of the book and I think structurally it's okay. Some of the information should've been condensed at times, but more might be something the majority of readers wanted. I enjoy reading books like this to understand the why. This book explains so much and that's why I continued to read and finish it. Why the 4?I can understand why certain reviews have marked it tedious. I get that. I did found it tough to read in that final 100 pages, but I was more engaged with finishing and information overload. This is a good book. The author has thrown in so much, so in hindsight I would recommend slowly digesting if you're allowed. That comment is more to the owner of the book, the library reader has to make the call based on the amount of people in the waiting list. I discovered a lot here, and as creatures of habit, you will notice these examples day after day. You can't unread what you've learned. I recommend reading this and not force reading it like I did. It's a book to slow down and read from time to time. "
546,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33537328-gheorghina,5,"This is one of the best books I have read. And for sure it is one that I will return to. I would just like to be able to memorize it all.The insight of making us understand how the human mind works and why we make some choices, is just brilliant.The only regret I have is that even if you read and understand things， the way our brain is wired， its software， can not be easily changed. This means that even if you are aware of things， it does not mean you are not susceptible for falling into traps. I cannot copy here the entire book content， but I will give an example:<“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion”. Moses took no animals into the ark;Noah did. The Moses illusion is explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context， and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him， but the mention of his name is not surprising. It also helps that Moses and Noah have the same vowel sound and number of syllables， so you unconsciously detect associative coherence between “Moses” and “ark” and so quickly accept the question. Replace Moses with George W Bush in this sentence and you will have a poor political joke but no illusion.>"

Within the first part of this book you've experienced all there is to experience. Kahneman goes through this book repeating the same theories in different ways again and again. Every now and then there will be a brief interlude of him bragging about his Nobel Prize or some other research he did that doesn't fully apply. This book got off to quite a bad start with me as it is 100% directed at Americans. I felt like many of the examples just confused the points more as they were based on knowledge that I, as an Australian, do not have just generally. He also frequently gives an example of an effect and then says ""You thought this"". A majority of the time though I did not think what he claimed, making me frustrated at the writing and the theory he then presented. I feel like this book was very much a cocky piece of writing in which the author frequently claimed that as a population we're pretty stupid. I can understand this was not his intention, but it came across that way. If you do want to read this book, I suggest a brief skimming of the conclusions section in the back. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. "
548,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7541671-ariadna73,5,Here is my comment in Spanish: http://bit.ly/XhWvoUDaniel Kahneman is a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. Curiously; he only devotes one chapter of this book to his field of expertise (but it is a heck of a chapter; I tell ya) He explains how our brains think in two ways: slow and fast. Our fast brain help us make quick decisions so we don't get ran over by cars or hit by balls; or stand up for days on the supermarket isles deciding which product to buy. The second system thinks more slowly and that is the one that help us make the most important decisions in our lives like to whom we will get married and for whom we should work. Well; those two systems trend to interact and screw up each other; so this is why the world is so screwed up. The book is pretty scientific; and dense. I understood probably a third of it; but I liked chap. 1 and the conclussions; and I honestly tried the statistics one (chap 3;4) and the economics ones (5); but as I said it was difficult. I think this book would be very good as an object of study in specialized classes. I really liked it. I gave it 9 weeks of my time. It is really good.
549,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16430203-swaroop,4,"This is a great book to read for anyone with a passing interest in behavioral economics. It's significantly more detailed and scientific than other pop-science books in the genre by Malcolm Gladwell et al.You can break up the book into 3 parts.In the first part, he dismantles the rational choice theory. Kahneman says he is not out to dismantle classical economic theory, according to him, he is not questioning the rational agent theory, he is just establishing that humans are not rational agents. (Cool story bro.)He then proceeds to dismantle another popular assumption, that humans always try to maximize utility. The third part of the book, about the 'science of happiness' was easily the least interesting part of the book. Coincidentally, this part of the book comprises mostly of work done after Tversky's death. My biggest problem with this book and many other books of this genre is the constant repetition. Frankly, this book is much better than others in this respect. That only speaks to how absurd other books are.This was a fantastic read but I think I am done with books like this for a while."

I had put this book down when I was younger and determined to take up this challenge for myself, I decided to read 50 pages per day years later. And I completed it within a month! Undoubtedly, my most difficult and yet enriching, it almost felt like attending economics classes and feeling doubly intelligent while reading this one. Daniel Kahneman is a Genius...He talks about how our mind processes things, how judgements happen and why we jump to conclusions, why we always chose the easy way to do things, risk luck and intuition and many more theories. ..Don’t buy this one if you’re looking for an easy-breezy read, but if you’re willing to dive into making your brain take the harder way into understanding these concepts, on Economics and Behavioural Psychology with interesting case studies, don’t miss this one written by a Nobel Laureate ⭐️"

I had initially dismissed this book without reading it, thinking it would be about business/economics (I’d blame it on the blurb found on the cover, something from the author of Freakonomics). I read it because I found out it’s a pretty famous book on Goodreads.com I enjoyed parts of the book; I’d say 3/5th of it. I had skimmed through mostly the rest of it as it was too technical. The book is a very deep and technical study (as far as I’m concerned) on behavioural sciences and economics. But whatever I did read, it was excellent. The use of examples and sample question scenarios helped in understanding how the brain works and how & why we think the way we think. It is not a light read; it required me to sit up and actively understand it. Not really my type of a book, and I probably wouldn’t want to read anything similar. "

Although I appreciate the detail in which the author goes into, at times it was a bit much for me, which made it a sluggish read at times.I did like how Kahneman, to demonstrate concepts, asks you questions or has you look at pictures, and then explains what was occurring in your mind during that exercise.

Drawing on knowledge acquired from years of research in cognitive and social psychology, Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Daniel Kahneman delivers his magnum opus on Behavioral Economics. This excellent book focuses on the three key sets of distinctions: between the automatic System 1 and the effortful System 2, between the conception of agents in classical economics and in behavioral economics, and between the experiencing and the remembering selves. This enlightening 512-page book is composed of thirty-eight chapters and broken out by the following five Parts: Part I. Two Systems, Part II. Heuristics and Biases, Part III. Overconfidence, Part IV. Choices, and Part V. Two Selves.Positives:1.	Award-winning research. A masterpiece of behavioral economics knowledge. Overall accessible.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of a master. How the mind works. The biases of intuition, judgment, and decision making. 3.	Excellent format. Each chapter is well laid out and ends with a Speaking of section that summarizes the content via quotes.4.	A great job of defining and summarizing new terms. ""In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."" 5.	Supports findings with countless research. Provides many accessible and practical examples that help readers understand the insightful conclusions.6.	A great job of letting us what we know and to what degree. ""It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work.""7.	You are guaranteed to learn something. Countless tidbits of knowledge throughout this insightful book and how it applies to the read world. ""The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.""8.	The differences of Systems 1 and 2 and how they function with one another. ""System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."" ""System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.""9.	Important recurring concepts like WYSIATI (What You See Is All There IS). ""You surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle.""10.	Understanding heuristics and biases. ""The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.""11.	Paradoxical results for your enjoyment. ""People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it.""12.	Understanding how our brains work, ""The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.""13.	Wisdom. ""'Risk' does not exist 'out there,' independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as 'real risk' or 'objective risk.'"" Bonus. ""To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.""14.	You will learn lessons that are practical. ""Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.""15.	An interesting look at overconfidence. ""Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."" ""Remember this rule: intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.""16.	Have you ever had to plan anything in your life? Meet the planning fallacy. ""This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an “outside view” and is the cure to the planning fallacy.""17.	A very interesting look at Econs and Humans. ""Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices.""18.	 Prospect theory explained. ""The pain of losing $900 is more than 90% of the pain of losing $1,000. These two insights are the essence of prospect theory.""19.	Avoiding poor psychology. ""The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.""20.	Great stuff on well being. 21.	An excellent Conclusions chapter that ties the book up comprehensively.Negatives:1.	Notes not linked up.2.	No formal separate bibliography.3.	Requires an investment of time. Thankfully, the book is worthy of your time.4.	The book overall is very well-written and accessible but some topics are challenging. 5.	Wanted more clarification on how Bayes's rules work.In summary, a masterpiece on behavioral economics. Dr. Kahneman shares his years of research and provides readers with an education on how the mind works. It requires an investment of your time but it so well worth it.

558,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41549696-jennifer-malinowski,4,"Very long book (the audiobook seemed to drag on interminably at times) describing Kahneman's premise that people have two different strategies for decision-making, called System 1 and System 2 (Fast and Slow). Overall, I think the book is a decent introduction for someone who is interested in why we make the choices we do, who doesn't already have a grasp of the theories or recently published studies in psychology and economics. That said, if you do, I don't think you'd find this book as interesting or helpful in extending your knowledge. Though by no means an expert in either, I have followed both fields, particularly where they intersect and have to do with consumer decision-making, and subsequently felt the book dragged on in parts and at times, even felt a little dated.Overall, a very solid 4* read. "
559,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009217-jonathan-donihue,5,"First off, I just want to say that this was one of the most arduous reading experiences of my life. ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is an amazing book, but it's not a casual read. That being said, I think it's one of the most important books of our time.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is a book about how we, as humans, make decisions. The author, Daniel Kahneman is an Economist and Nobel Laureate who has spent a lifetime (he's 82 years old) studying why we make stupid decisions. Alright, that's actually a bit simplistic. He and his partner, Amos Tversky, spent their entire careers studying how we decide things.In this book, Kahneman asks us to imagine that our minds are actually two distinct beings - beings that he (and other economists and psychologists) refer to as 'System 1' and 'System 2'. ""... I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make."" - Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 13). I would describe the 'two agents' as follows: System 1 is intuitive, emotional, artistic, imaginative, creative, spontaneous, forgetful, vain, superstitious, illogical, and capricious. System 2 is logical, deliberative, suspicious, wary, calculating, practical, attentive, just, predictable, and (unfortunately) indolent.Now, when you think about it, this internal dynamic is not really a new discovery. The innate dichotomy of the human mind has been a source of introspection, conversation, speculation, and proselytization for thousands of years. What makes this book different than the rest, though, is the lack of condemnation of either of the Systems of thought. Instead of venerating one and vilifying the other, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" focuses on the dynamic between the two systems of thought and shows how, if we understand and accept ourselves fully, we can make full use of the best aspects of our two selves and avoid the less desirable aspects.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is full to the brim with statistics and survey results and laborious studies and quotes from esoteric scientific papers. As such, I found it a very challenging read. Nonetheless, in spite of the difficult subject matter, Kahneman is able to keep it real. Real world anecdotes and easy to imagine thought experiments are woven into the narrative to help the lay person (like me) to more fully grok the subject matter. Additionally, each chapter sticks to one topic and ends with a summery that's designed to help the reader remember what was covered and to provide some simple ways that we can use the chapters lessons in our everyday lives. Theses summaries take the form ""Speaking of........) Here are some examples from the book:Chapter 1 - Speaking of System 1 and System 2 “He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.” “This was a pure System 1 response. She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.” “This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.”Chapter 5 -Speaking of Cognitive Ease""Let's not dismiss their business plan just because the font makes it hard to read.""""We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but let's think it through again.""""Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.""""I'm in a good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.""Chapter 36 - Speaking of Life as a Story “He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.” “The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.” “You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?” “She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”Chapter 37 - Speaking of Experienced Well-Being “The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.” “The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?” “Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.”Although the author didn't say anything in the book about spiritual growth, from my perspective, the entire book was a textbook on the subject of self mastery. I believe that it could be used in combination with specifically adapted meditation practices and lifestyle changes as primary source-book for a serious spiritual development class or group."
560,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57346995-lexy,3,I thought that this book was okay 
561,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9485245-prashant,5,"Thinking fast and slow is a book that came along in 2011 though I still feel that it’s one of the most relevant and important books of its times. Personally, for me, it’s one of those books where every time you read it, you are able to learn something new.Though there is a caveat: This is a book which will scare you the moment you will pick it, as it's a heavy book to read, though if you can fight back and finish the first 100 pages then I can assure you that the writing of Daniel Kanheman will be able to keep you intrigued in the book until you finish it. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.  Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Though we do need to talk a little about the author as well i.e. Daniel Kahneman, is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is seen by many as one of the world’s most important thinkers. So, If you are thinking, I am in sales and how would this book help in my subject then for your surprise, his research influences our daily lives in a big way, for example, he gives an example of a situation in which people who are risk-averse, becomes risky and vice versa. He helps us understand, how our minds work in perceiving a statement and how it influences our decisions. If you are feeling that I have a boring, normal job then why should I read this book- then it could help you understand when we should approach people to get a decision in our favor i.e. you should approach your boss for raise when his tummy is full and he is happy as that’s the time when people actually put their guards down and use their intuitions more than their brains.If you are a stock-broker then it gives the perfect advice to not follow your stocks on a regular basis and looking them only once a quarter to generate better returns. There are so many words of wisdom in this book that it’s difficult for me to capture all over here and I can assure you that it’s tougher to implement those in your life, ergo, I have decided to read this book every year and I feel that it’s definitely not a bad decision. The last section of the book explores the contrasting ‘selves’ embodied in every individual: the remembering self and the experiencing self. The remembering self refers to the aspect in our nature that evaluates episodes by the lasting memory they leave; the one that keeps track of goals and keeps mental accounts; that answers the question: how satisfied are you with your life? The experiencing self is the aspect that feels every moment; that evaluates pleasure and pain on the go. Interestingly, these two selves are in conflict. The remembering self overweights the end of an episode and is indifferent to duration; it often promotes actions based on the memory that will result. Paradoxically, people may prefer an experience that is more painful in aggregate sum than another simply as a result of it ending on a less painful note.Kahneman concludes that both selves are necessary for evaluating subjective wellbeing, as both give us important information. Focusing exclusively on one or the other therefore excludes an important aspect of wellbeing.This book succeeds in instilling an awareness of the many biases and heuristics that lead to errors of judgments and poor decision-making. Above all, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a highly enjoyable and informative read for anyone wanting an insight into the human mind. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."

Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."

564,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,4,"Daniel Kahneman was one of my professor's phd advisor at Princeton, and you can tell. Before reading this book I had a chance to be part of all these tiny experiments and see on my own mind where I have a bias and where I naturally tend to use ""system 2"" for my own good. Like everyone else, I have my goods and bads too, and this book does a very good job to explain *why* one might respond in a particular way to a question, but I have no idea how to correct them besides trying hard to be careful - which contradicts the definition of a bias really, so maybe they're not fixable. Having been through many of the experiments in this book (as well as the ones in Choices, values & frames, which I plan to read as well soon), I'm now really glad that I postponed reading this by two years! (The size was initially overwhelming, but it turned out to be a very casual read)The book feels very cozy after having been through the experiments, but it's great nevertheless, regardless of this practical stuff. I do wish that more of those posting on fb 10 strong opinions on 10 different subjects / day would read it too :)Some of my favorite quotes:In 1955, as a twenty-one-year-old lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces, I was assigned to set up an interview system for the entire army. If you wonder why such a responsibility would be forced upon someone so young, bear in mind that the state of Israel itself was only seven years old at the time.Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgement is missing - what we see is all there is. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. [...] Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.""How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?"" The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the ""Moses illusion"". Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did."
565,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is a book I'm more glad I have read than I actually enjoyed reading it. My favorite passage, incidentally, came in the introduction, when the author describes his working relationship with a close collaborator and which I identified with strongly. Several other points I took away are as follows:--the difference between thinking actively and passively, and particularly, that active thinking affects behavior in other ways (making people more selfish, superficial, and sexist). I identify with this based on how people perceive me when I'm exceptionally busy.--the concept of ""what you see is all there is,"" and particularly of priming effects, and implicit influence of what's in front of you. (My boss seems especially vulnerable to this!) As well this makes me rededicate myself to the theory that you should hire people based on their resumes rather than interviews; or at the very least employ your judgment only after scoring candidates (or other things, it's relevant more broadly) on more objective metrics--a valuable construct in business, to postulate how things could go wrong, as a method to avoid groupthink, encourage creative thinking, and make sure opposing ideas are heard--the difference in risk aversion with respect to gains and losses...not taking good gambles, and preferring risky gambles to limit losses. The author points out that most people avoid this pitfall when the games are presented as one they would play multiple times, but also highlight that in life, any gamble is almost certainly one of many. However, despite this interesting research, I found this book rather dry, and I read almost exclusively non-fiction. As well, the author's many references to the influence of his work, his Nobel Prize, etc., grew old by the end. The format, of repeating the research results in several different ways, with somewhat cheesy examples at the end of each chapter, was a bit didactic for me. But I did learn a good amount. "
566,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8070622-adam-morva,5,"When I'm hungry I tend to make myself bigger servings of meals than I can comfortably eat, and I always want to buy more food and snacks in the supermarket than I need. We could call this a bias, I suppose. Some primal part of my mind gets bathed in hunger hormones and such, and it makes me do things I shouldn't be doing, and those things would make me fat, so I learned to control this hellish urge, and whenever I do the groceries hungry, I remind myself of this fact. Whenever I start a meal really hungry I pick less food than what my eyes desire, and even gulp down a glass of water in order to ease my sense of hunger a bit.Why do I tell you this?Because some reviewers have said that it's useless to read about our mental short circuits, because we can't possibly do anything about them.Wrong. We can!Identifying your biases and intellectual pitfalls is the first step to combating them.Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about much more nuanced, and much less obvious circuits of thinking, and boy, it talks about a lot of them. I fancy myself a skeptic, a scientist, a student of thinking, so I've already known about most of the topics this book touches, and while it is not a complete list of all our intellectual quirks, IT TOOK ME YEARS to learn about the ones found in the book. So dear potential reader, you are lucky, because thanks to this wonderful book, you get to learn about them in the space of a lazy weekend (499 pages).Whether you are a big time corporate fatcat, a teacher, or a soccer mom, you'll benefit greatly from keeping at least some of Kahneman's conclusions in mind, because you are human, and we humans need to learn how to think, because we tend to make all sorts of mistakes."

Thinking, Fast and Slow is the product of new (at the time) research on quick, mostly subconscious, intuitive thought and deliberate, logical thought. The major insight from this book is the many, many ways that the intuition can be misled and provide one with faulty conclusions. This insight was most applicable to me as I consider my role on a book acquisition committee, as my team meets regularly to collectively decide which book proposals to accept and reject. There is immense potential for intuitive factors to weigh largely in these decisions as we make a long series of important decisions carefully but with necessary time restrictions. I strongly advise anyone in similar decision-making situations to read this book, or another book on this topic. It will give you good tools for careful thinking and for helping others avoid unwarranted conclusions. One reason you might choose not to read this book is that it is quite long and dedicates too much space to describing his research methodology. I would also have preferred more discussion of ways that a well-developed intuition can be an asset (though Kahnneman appropriately points out that awareness of intuition pitfalls can, over time, lead to better intuition). Another book I've read, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do does this well and would be a good companion or follow-up to this book."

Most of the books I give 4-star reviews to are well written and interesting, but not important per se, like Harry Potter or David McCulluogh's book on the building of the Panama Canal. No matter how good those books are, they're not exactly life changing. Thinking, Fast and Slow is well written and quite interesting, but beyond that I think it's an important book because it explains so much about how we think, why we make the choices we make, and how we can make better choices as well as help others to make better choices. As I read it I found myself thinking I need to read this about 10 times and take notes about how to apply it to my business, my family, and my other relationships. There is just so much useful stuff in the book. I could use it to change the language I use on my business website, I could use it to change how I communicate with my children, and I could use it to change how I interact with my spouse. There is so much knowledge packed into this, and I especially appreciate how, at the end of each chapter, Kahneman gives a few 1-2 sentence practical examples of how his research can be used in the real world."

How do I keep getting suckered into reading these books about cognitive biases and heuristics, I do not know. This one's pretty well made though and exposes a theory of two thought system: an intuitive one that takes instant decisions (like putting pants on in the morning) and hardwired to create coherence out of everything. It is this brain that scares people watching horror movies. There is also the second thought system that can very well override the first, which leads to conscious cognition. So that's cool and it's very enlightening to learn how to differentiate the two in your daily reactions.The book can't transcend its nature though as it plays it safe with its own scientific angle and ends up being just a list of situations where heuristics are involved. There are a lot of books like this available on the market albeit it is quite well done. It can get mind-numbing after a while and especially if you read the audiobook version like I did. Wanted to throw myself off a cliff after 15 or so hours."
570,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's 

. Highly recommended. I listened to the audio, and grasped most of it, but if I had it to do over again, I'd read the physical book, as there are tables to refer to, and some of the concepts require a bit more mulling over than when a narrator is breezily reading it to you."

I was tempted to read fast (because it’s interesting) but I forced myself to slow down, reading Michael Lewis’ The Undoing Project for a change of rhythm."
572,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60806694-sophie-nguyen,5,"First of all, it is impossible to not notice how many people on our friend list are ""currently reading this"" or ""marked it as to-read"" (9 for me - please check yours!). What that number has to say is this 500-page work of research is a very worthwhile but by no means easy read. Rest assured, the author has made it as comprehensible as possible. The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2. Realize what you have learned in traditional Economics is seriously flawed because Humans are different from Econs. It seems like you are watching a tuff of war between Economists and Psychologists reading this. 3. Recognize that the truth is not everything but coherence is, to a flawed thinking system so change takes (a whole lot of) time to happenA disclaimer for anyone who intends to absorb this masterpiece, know beforehand that it can be:- Depressing. Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."
573,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart,5,"Wonderful ideas. I’m so glad I read this.He defines two types of thinking. Fast thinking is our intuition/instinct. We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy. He calls it “System 1.""Slow thinking is doing complicated math problems, or reading and analyzing data to come to a conclusion. He calls it “System 2.” Slow thinking takes energy. It uses glucose. People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job. DATA:Narrative mode: a mixture of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook length: 20 hrs and 2 mins. Swearing language: none that I recall. Sexual content: none. Book copyright: 2011.

574,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn). "
575,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is probably the most important book of the 21st century. There are so many things to learn from this book. Below I've listed the ones that stood out for me.•	People intuitively can't think in probabilities.•	Fast thinking (System 1) uses heuristics (mental short-cuts), intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems.•	Slow thinking (System 2) is based on reason and deliberate thought.•	System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1•	People avoid cognitive effort (slow thinking) and rely on their intuition too much.•	Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything.•	Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.•	Intuition is nothing more than recognition (sometimes superior recognition).•	It is easier to recognize the mistakes of others than our own.•	We know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don’t know the majority of our thoughts which are in the subconscious.•	Our mood affects our subconscious thinking.•	System 2 is in-charge of detecting lies and System 1 in believing them.•	Halo effect – a tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect of their personality.•	Availability bias – most obvious and prevalent example pops up first in the mind•	Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers.•	Anchoring has a huge effect on our thinking and decisions and it can be found everywhere.•	Priming – our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit or recognize. We can be primed just by being exposed to words.•	People are very bad at dealing with small risks. Either they ignore them altogether or tend to overreact.•	People ignore base rates when come across any new information.•	We fool ourselves by constructing inaccurate accounts of the past. •	We do not recognize role of luck in our life.•	We should start judging decisions by how they were made and not only by their outcomes.•	Overconfidence in explaining the past makes us believe that we can predict the future as well.•	Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be dangerous as it reinforces your beliefs and you ignore new facts which don't match your perceptions.•	Planning fallacy – projects almost always go over budget and take longer than expected. •	Loss aversion is the driving factor in most financial and other decisions.•	Endowment Effect – value of something goes up when you own it.•	Bad events weigh much more in our mind than good things.•	Prospect theory shows how human beings decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty. It shows that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point rather than absolute outcomes.•	Do not consider one risk or gamble in isolation, think of all of them spread over a long period of time and will see that this decision actually carries very little risk.•	People keep mental accounts for their expenses/losses or actions in order to keep score. •	In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none. •	Framing of a question or a situation greatly affects our beliefs and preferences, and thus outcome."
576,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"When I picked up this book I had huge expectations. After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
577,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
578,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."

Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower.

But in 2018, I was trying to nourish my attention span by reading 20 pages a day. Thus I'm trying to pick it again and the payoff is pretty well. Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people. This book is my very first book about psychology and I really like about they're trying extract conclusions from the given data rather than hindsight assumption. "

It did not particularly long for me to come around to read it afterwards and I am really glad I did. Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating.

An achievement of lifelong investigating into what makes us tick, Kahneman presents a multitude of instances (with examples) of how we come to make the decisions we do - and how often they are the ""wrong"" ones. This book is accessible, engaging and written with the mass consumer in mind (rather than a scientific journal) - without the feeling like the reader is being talked down to.

586,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."

As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"

And I looked forward to reading this popular work. I liked the book, but I did not find it exceptionally good.

596,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
597,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"

If you want to avoid ever being gulled or shanghai-ed by a magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you!Daniel Kahnemann, for the purposes of Thinking, Fast and Slow, reduces the brain to System 1 and System 2 - essentially the automatic brain and the voluntary brain. It is a great over-simplification, as he himself concedes - more so, even, than the common reduction to id, ego and superego. As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
599,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

600,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's

The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2. Realize what you have learned in traditional Economics is seriously flawed because Humans are different from Econs. It seems like you are watching a tuff of war between Economists and Psychologists reading this. 3.

Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."

We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy.

People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job. DATA:Narrative mode: a mixture of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook length: 20 hrs and 2 mins. Swearing language: none that I recall. Sexual content: none. Book copyright: 2011.

604,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn). "
605,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is probably the most important book of the 21st century. There are so many things to learn from this book. Below I've listed the ones that stood out for me.•	People intuitively can't think in probabilities.•	Fast thinking (System 1) uses heuristics (mental short-cuts), intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems.•	Slow thinking (System 2) is based on reason and deliberate thought.•	System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1•	People avoid cognitive effort (slow thinking) and rely on their intuition too much.•	Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything.•	Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.•	Intuition is nothing more than recognition (sometimes superior recognition).•	It is easier to recognize the mistakes of others than our own.•	We know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don’t know the majority of our thoughts which are in the subconscious.•	Our mood affects our subconscious thinking.•	System 2 is in-charge of detecting lies and System 1 in believing them.•	Halo effect – a tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect of their personality.•	Availability bias – most obvious and prevalent example pops up first in the mind•	Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers.•	Anchoring has a huge effect on our thinking and decisions and it can be found everywhere.•	Priming – our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit or recognize. We can be primed just by being exposed to words.•	People are very bad at dealing with small risks. Either they ignore them altogether or tend to overreact.•	People ignore base rates when come across any new information.•	We fool ourselves by constructing inaccurate accounts of the past. •	We do not recognize role of luck in our life.•	We should start judging decisions by how they were made and not only by their outcomes.•	Overconfidence in explaining the past makes us believe that we can predict the future as well.•	Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can be dangerous as it reinforces your beliefs and you ignore new facts which don't match your perceptions.•	Planning fallacy – projects almost always go over budget and take longer than expected. •	Loss aversion is the driving factor in most financial and other decisions.•	Endowment Effect – value of something goes up when you own it.•	Bad events weigh much more in our mind than good things.•	Prospect theory shows how human beings decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty. It shows that people think in terms of expected utility relative to a reference point rather than absolute outcomes.•	Do not consider one risk or gamble in isolation, think of all of them spread over a long period of time and will see that this decision actually carries very little risk.•	People keep mental accounts for their expenses/losses or actions in order to keep score. •	In order to avoid hindsight bias, make decisions after very thorough thought or almost none. •	Framing of a question or a situation greatly affects our beliefs and preferences, and thus outcome."
606,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"When I picked up this book I had huge expectations. After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
607,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
608,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."
610,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-str-mquist,4,"""Absolutely amazing two-thirds of a book! Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower. I almost felt like the last part of the book was penned by a different author. 400 pages of brilliance though."""
611,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80511965-naing-lin,4,"I tried to read it two or three years ago. Since it's long read and I'm couldn't focus back then. So, I dropped it. But in 2018, I was trying to nourish my attention span by reading 20 pages a day. Thus I'm trying to pick it again and the payoff is pretty well. Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people. This book is my very first book about psychology and I really like about they're trying extract conclusions from the given data rather than hindsight assumption. "
612,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I flat-out stayed clear of this book for at least a year, until I finally picked up at an airport earlier this month. It did not particularly long for me to come around to read it afterwards and I am really glad I did. Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating. Tis is a book that requires slow reading, but it's definitely worth it."

An achievement of lifelong investigating into what makes us tick, Kahneman presents a multitude of instances (with examples) of how we come to make the decisions we do - and how often they are the ""wrong"" ones. This book is accessible, engaging and written with the mass consumer in mind (rather than a scientific journal) - without the feeling like the reader is being talked down to. I can't recommend this book strongly enough."

For the most part, he made it as ""user friendly"" as he could. There were many parts of the book that his diagrams were invaluable. Many things in this book are things we've been told in stuff like ""Brain Games"" but reading his explanations made things make soooo much more sense on why our brains act like that. Highly recommend!"
615,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818089-jurgen-appelo,4,A very important book. Everyone should read it. But 1 point off for being so terribly repetitive.
616,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."
617,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,5,"Edit 17th February 2017:Here's another looong blog post which goes through the studies cited by Kahneman and finds that most of them are underpowered: these studies have been run on so few students that the results they show could be wrong. As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"

And I looked forward to reading this popular work. I liked the book, but I did not find it exceptionally good. Especially the later chapters could have been written somewhat clearer. and all in all, nothing new is presented.

This is one of the rarest non-fictions that has as much value in its whole as much as in its summary. You could get the 'what' of the book in summary and feel sufficed; but to pore deeply and meticulously to identify the thousand 'why's of your thought process, the laziness of the brain, the intuitions, the cheats, the hindsight, and the misjudgments edifies and keeps you on guard."

626,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
627,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"

If you want to avoid ever being gulled or shanghai-ed by a magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you!Daniel Kahnemann, for the purposes of Thinking, Fast and Slow, reduces the brain to System 1 and System 2 - essentially the automatic brain and the voluntary brain. It is a great over-simplification, as he himself concedes - more so, even, than the common reduction to id, ego and superego. As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
629,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

630,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3170906-eric,4,"Kahneman describes two the two modes of thinking, the intuitive mode, which he calls ""System One"", and the engaged, active mode, which he calls ""System Two"". System One performs those automatic tasks of daily life that require no conscious thought, such as driving, recognizing faces, and reading people's emotions. System Two kicks in when we multiply numbers or have to make decisions requiring thought. This book is really about decision making, and how the two ""Systems"" interact in making decisions. The problem is that humans don't make as good decisions as ""econs"" (hypothetical rational entities). The reason we don't make as good decisions as we could is that System Two is lazy, and will always seek a shortcut. Further, System Two is in thrall to judgments made by System One, which often set System Two off onto an incorrect premise. Even when presented with statistics which would result in better decisions, humans will ignore said statistics and ""go with their guts"", resulting in poor decisions.This fascinating book intersects with concepts of game theory and with issues discussed in Susan Cain's 

. Highly recommended. I listened to the audio, and grasped most of it, but if I had it to do over again, I'd read the physical book, as there are tables to refer to, and some of the concepts require a bit more mulling over than when a narrator is breezily reading it to you."

What that number has to say is this 500-page work of research is a very worthwhile but by no means easy read. Rest assured, the author has made it as comprehensible as possible. The structure of the content is extremely clear and logical, the subsequent chapters almost always reflect the preceding ones. It is a vast body of information that culminates from years of research and a relentless quest to refine his theories. This book may serve you in 3 ways:1. Know yourself and know others better. To be more specific, you will know the flaws of your minds and how you can avoid the ""minefield"". Humans are terrible at statistics.2. Realize what you have learned in traditional Economics is seriously flawed because Humans are different from Econs. It seems like you are watching a tuff of war between Economists and Psychologists reading this. 3. Recognize that the truth is not everything but coherence is, to a flawed thinking system so change takes (a whole lot of) time to happenA disclaimer for anyone who intends to absorb this masterpiece, know beforehand that it can be:- Depressing. Besides exposing the incompetency of our thinking, the author also sheds light on many factors that humans often overweight or underweight such as the role of intuition and luck. Just keep in mind that we humans are praised enough (the author doesn't deny the extraordinary ability of our brain, he just doesn't focus on it), someone needs to bring us to the ground. I was especially intrigued by his view on luck because it resonates with what I've learned from Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Successful people are incredibly lucky, way more than they themselves and everyone acknowledge.- Theoretical. If ""Predictably Irrational"" brought you here like I was, you would soon be discouraged since it focuses on the most basic scenarios in life. There are many experiments but they are far from fancy like the ones carried out in ""Predictably Irrational"". But from those seemingly simple concepts and situations, the writer defer the most striking findings for both psychology and economics field. Once you've read this, you would realize most stories talked about in ""Predictably Irrational"" and the like were handed down from this book. It's like the forefather of every work that comes after. You will encounter hundreds of terms throughout this as well. Beware.- Vocabulary. You will sometimes find yourself miserable like an illiterate reading this book. If the author was ever to take an IELTS writing test, he would surely score a 10 out of 9. Please don't feel ashamed of yourself if you have to constantly look up the words in a dictionary just to realize its meaning is not that defining. The author simply doesn't like repeating words. My favorite moment in this book is when I identify the failure of System 1 or 2 before the author points it out to me. Another moment is the ""Speaking of..."" part at the end of every chapter because like the author has said this book is oriented to critics and gossipers rather than decision-makers. Everything is crystal clear once it's put under the scope of a gossiper. For instance, when speaking of Amnesia Vacations: 
""You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?""
All in all, I recommend this book to everyone. If you can't read it all, at least read the first part, the last 2 chapters or the 2 papers that earn him the Nobel Prize. Especially the last 2 chapters which strongly remind me of the basis of happiness according to Buddhism's point of view. The author is so humble considering his profound knowledge. As for me, this book has taken two months of sweat and tears to finish but it is also one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding experiences of my life."

We use it most of the time and it works well most of the time. It doesn’t take any energy. He calls it “System 1.""Slow thinking is doing complicated math problems, or reading and analyzing data to come to a conclusion. He calls it “System 2.” Slow thinking takes energy. It uses glucose. People with less glucose (sugar) in their system aren’t able to think in System 2 as well as when they have glucose in them. Using willpower for one activity uses glucose, leaving less energy for other System 2 activities.There were many examples and results of studies which amazed me. I learned that when something is really important, do not trust my intuition (system 1 thinking) - spend some time supplementing it with system 2.Now here’s the bad part:I listened to this as an audiobook. My mind wandered a lot. I wasn’t paying attention for probably a fourth of the book. The first half was the best. The last half or third seemed to be mostly probability and statistics. For example, if you are here would you choose A or B? But if you are there, your choice would be different. My mind wandered a lot during those parts. But still, I got much out of this book. I think it might be better read as a physical book than listened to, so the mind wouldn’t wander as much. It’s like a textbook. It will take System 2 energy to read and understand everything.PDF File:I bought the audiobook from audible which provided a pdf file. That was good because the author referred to the pdf pictures.EXAMPLES:Writing Book Reviews:When watching a play or reading a book, we might feel one way (A) during 90% of the story and feel differently (B) during the last several minutes. Our rating of the book will be mostly the (B) feelings - as if we forgot about (A) feelings. One of the tests related to this was done with pain. The left arm was in ice water for 20 minutes with the final 5 minutes in slightly warmer water with less pain. Then the right arm was in ice water for 10 minutes with full pain at the end. Afterwards the subjects were told to retake the test and they could choose which arm to test. They chose to do the left arm, because they remembered less pain. The left arm had suffered more pain in total - the 20 minutes. (I may have the minutes wrong, but you get the idea.)Marriage:Statistics about marriage really stuck with me - surprised me. The last picture in the pdf file shows the results of a survey of respondents who were asked about their satisfaction with life (SL). They were asked this every year during a 9 year period that had marriage in the middle. 4 years before they married SL was 3. It started increasing 2 years before marriage and was 6 at the time of marriage. 5 years after marriage it dropped to 2. Influencing Judges:Judges were asked to impose a sentence on a woman for shoplifting. Shortly before they decided, the number 3 or 9 was shown to them from a dice roll. Judges who saw the 9, sentenced the woman to 8 months. Judges who saw the 3 sentenced her to 5 months. (The months are averages.)Influencing Parole Boards:More prison inmates were given parole when their case was decided right after the judges had eaten food.NOBEL PRIZE:The author is a psychologist but received a Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory, which is about how people make decisions.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Patrick Egan did a great job.

634,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"I'm trying to be more conservative with my 5-star ratings but if anything deserves five it's this. I've been familiar with the research of Kahneman and his late colleague Amos Tversky for several years now. Their work, while officially psychology, has applications to economics, policy making, and most any field or endeavour requiring humans to make decisions.The premise is simple: you, as a human being, aren't a rational thinker. Instead, you operate with two ""modes"" of thought -- which Kahneman labels System 1 and System 2 for the purposes of the book -- analogous to the ""fast and slow"" of the title. System 1 is evolutionarily older and implicated in rapid judgments. It operates on principles of association and coherence, making decisions by what it knows and what tells a good story. System 2 is newer and practically unique to humans, being the system we use for complex math and decision-making, as well as impulse control. System 2 is what we consider our ""self"", the rational choice-maker that thinks orderly and logical thoughts. The only problem is that System 2 is underdeveloped in comparison to System 1. As Kahneman says, System 2 is lazy. Consequently, we tend to accept intuitive judgments with little scrutiny, and even our rationality can, in many instances, become subservient to those powerful causal stories generated by System 1. Starting from that two-minds premise, Kahneman covers a bewildering array of conditions in which our illusion of rationality falls to pieces. We're bad at statistical thinking, preferring what we know and experience to a more global view. We prefer anecdotes to likelihoods, individuals to categories, and stories to probabilities. We blame irrelevant causes -- or our own talents -- for chance outcomes. We overestimate our odds in bad situations and underestimate probabilities in favorable conditions. We're more averse to loss than motivated by gain, and even those measures of loss and gain are subjective, determined by arbitrary reference points in our surroundings. Kahneman's conclusion is that we aren't rational decision makers, and it makes little sense to act as if we're homo economicus presented in rational-agent models of economics. We aren't necessarily irrational, but a blend of knee-jerk intuitions -- which aren't reliable in situations requiring probabilistic thinking -- and rationality which must be coaxed out of an evolutionarily conservative body. Contrary to rationality, we weight options differently according to how we feel about them, whether they represent losses or gains, even how the information is presented to us (the framing effect).These conclusions hold a personal significance for me, as I run across intuitive, anecdotal and self-absorbed thinking in many domains across many areas of my life (not to exclude myself from that charge, as I'm capable of lazy rationality and impulsive decisions as much as anyone; that kind of self-reflection is another positive). Kahneman's examples are largely directed at economists and policy-makers, but the implications of his research have obvious applications to politics, professional disagreements, and even internet arguments. All in all this is a fascinating, comprehensive, and lay-accessible work that should be required reading for anyone who cares to think about anything ever (or at least realize why the person arguing with you is being so stubborn).

There are so many things to learn from this book. Below I've listed the ones that stood out for me.•	People intuitively can't think in probabilities.•	Fast thinking (System 1) uses heuristics (mental short-cuts), intuition and perception/memory and the vast majority of our decisions are made using this systems.•	Slow thinking (System 2) is based on reason and deliberate thought.•	System 2, unless trained, will often inherently trust system 1•	People avoid cognitive effort (slow thinking) and rely on their intuition too much.•	Pain and pleasure drives mostly everything.•	Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.•	Intuition is nothing more than recognition (sometimes superior recognition).•	It is easier to recognize the mistakes of others than our own.•	We know ourselves much less than we think we do as we don’t know the majority of our thoughts which are in the subconscious.•	Our mood affects our subconscious thinking.•	System 2 is in-charge of detecting lies and System 1 in believing them.•	Halo effect – a tendency to like everything about a person if you like one aspect of their personality.•	Availability bias – most obvious and prevalent example pops up first in the mind•	Statistical sampling can give strange results when using small numbers.•	Anchoring has a huge effect on our thinking and decisions and it can be found everywhere.•	Priming – our thoughts and behaviors are affected much more by our environment and other things we are exposed to than we care to admit or recognize.

636,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"When I picked up this book I had huge expectations. After all, Daniel Kahneman was praised by people like Malcolm Gladwell, Naseem Nicholas Taleb, Michael Lewis, all of whom I respect a lot. Of course, he is also a Nobel prize winner in economics. I see good amount of books out there on the topic of Behavioral Science/Psychology and one such book that I had read recently was Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. I felt Blink was very straightforward but a bit too simplistic for my liking. Thinking, Fast and Slow on the other hand, is a very comprehensive piece of work.The book starts by describing two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is basically our Intuition(or Subconscious) which runs on Auto-Pilot. This system is of course fast and effortless. System 2 on the other hand involves careful contemplation, hence it is slow and requires a lot more effort to deal with situations that are difficult or complex. For me, these initial chapters were the best part of the book.On many occasions after the initial chapters though, I felt Author seriously tested my patience by using jargon and writing style that is very typical of researchers. One chapter after another, Author introduced new theories and he used the kind of language you would typically see in Research Papers. After some thinking I realized that Mr. Kahneman is a Researcher and he has written this book as an extended collection of various concepts and theories which he came across in his Research over the years.This is definitely not a book that you would want to read in a week or two. I actually had to re-read certain chapters twice to understand some of the concepts and in fact, I actually regularly went back to paragraphs while reading one page. Things like peak end rule, prospect theory, planning fallacy, base rate fallacy, halo effect, hedgehog effect etc are used extensively throughout the book making it very difficult for some one like me with no strong Economics and Behavioral Science background to understand his actual points. At the core, all these theories turn out to be simple human behavioral patterns. But still, of all the 28 books I have read this year so far, this is the most I have struggled. This book is a promising piece of work but if you are hoping to learn something about Economics or if you were hoping for Author to enlighten you by making suggestions and claims that will help improve your life and make better decisions, then this is definitely NOT the book for you.All in all, for most part while reading this book I had to use System 2 and in-spite of that, I will definitely advise you to re-read this book multiple times over the years to get the maximum out of it. Naseem Nicholas Taleb is correct when he says that:  ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is a landmark book in Social thought"" "
637,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This book is a well-respected one which has at its heart one main theory: that we have a certain amount of automatic routines in our brain which we rely on, as well as a more analytical way of thinking. The automatic routines are “fast” thinking, and they’ve served us well evolutionarily, allowing us to come to immediate conclusions in dangerous and ambiguous situations. The analytical way of thinking is “slow”, and correspondingly resource intensive, and we tend to only engage it when we have to.So far, so good, and I don’t disagree with his findings and examples as generalisations. There’ll always be exceptions, for example being primed with the words “banana” and “vomit” does not make me associate bananas and vomit. Instead, I think about my lack of a gallbladder, because I know that a lot of the time when I’m sick, it’s nothing to do with the food I’ve eaten as such and just to do with the proportion of fat in it, thus meaning that I have learnt to de-associate food as a specific cause-and-effect for nausea. Tl;dr: exception that proves the rule. My routines have been rewritten to reflect my reality, and now that is the assumption I make when I’m thinking lazily.The problem is that he goes into such excruciating detail of statistics, despite the fact that he knows from his own work that his readers have no intuitive grasp thereof — and me even less so, since numbers are a weak spot for me. And he uses examples based on the American educational system, which is also Greek (or Arabic) to me. And sometimes he’ll digress into discussing some theory from economics, leaving me frankly bored.It’s worth reading, I think, but I might almost recommend you pick up one of the ‘thirty second’ or ‘simplified’ versions other people have written. The central thesis is fine, but the book drags on.Originally posted here."
638,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This book took me a while to read, indeed longer than few others have taken considering the length of this work, but that is because I don't feel that one can both read this fast and understand it well at the same time. Each chapter needs its own bit of thinking and that's just fine for me as some of the insights Mr Kahneman imparts are indeed world-shattering. While a lot of the content can feel dry in the beginning, I feel that as an overarching story -- full of evidence and proof -- the author has indeed managed a narrative and not a scientific work in which we are shown the partiality of our own thoughts and the weakness of our own rationality. It is these very things we need to keep in mind in order to rightly manage the various decisions put upon us in our lives.Lastly, I have some special regard for a work which manages to both clearly delineate its own topic but also to stray from it to worlds otherwise unmentioned without this becoming cumbersome. This was clearly the case here with certain forays into epistemology, including factual bases that should be more commonly accepted by academics for whom all-too-often epistemological investigations into the quality of their own work are kept on the back foot by what the author of this work would call System 1. Let's no longer have that be the case...Lastly, I have nothing but respect and admiration for the people recommending this book because I feel this book deserves to be read by each and every person. In a world where simple decisions, taken on instinct without us being able to describe them, can shape so much of our lives, we should know all about our internal biases before committing to anything.

Fail to sufficiently de-technicalize your content and you've lost your target audience. But dumb things down too much and you forgo the science for the pop.Daniel Kahneman—the creator, alongside the late Amos Tversky, of the wildly influential ""prospect theory""—strikes a pretty solid balance between depth and accessibility. Sure, things can get repetitive at times. And even though Kahneman is by no stretch a bad writer, he most certainly isn't a good one. (Unfortunately, people sometimes seem to conflate the two.) But as for challenging the belief that humans are, at heart, supremely rational agents, the book gets the job done.Personally, I wish that the book was both shorter and longer. Shorter because, while I appreciate the need for the human-interest angle, I found Kahneman's frequent personal asides distracting and largely irrelevant. (I mean, Tversky and Kahneman's ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases"" covers much of the same ground as Part II in a scant dozen or so pages.) I wish it was longer in other respects, since, as it stands, Kahneman presents certain key aspects of his approach (e.g., Bayesian statistics) as purely a matter of scientific faith.Thinking, Fast and Slow may not be an absolute masterpiece qua book. But it would probably still be a good idea for most people—or at those involved in any sort of quantitative research—to familiarize themselves with its subject matter."

Anybody I know will or would be amazed by the fact that such a riveting book was penned by a Nobel laureate for economy. 400 pages of amazing insights and bitter realizations of what you do wrong when you think and why. Unfortunately, the final third of the book concerns Kahneman's main interest, economy. If you're not so inclined, prepare for a dull ride. I will even go as far as saying that the first 2/3 of the book is five-star and the remaining part is not worth your while. The problem is that the author assumes that getting the maximum amount of money is everyone's main motivation. Another strange thing is that he (after revealing some statistical wrong-thinking we people do that made me blush) suddenly mistakes probabilities to be general. He speaks broadly about peoples ""irrational"" fear of e.g. earthquakes when the risk of getting murdered in town 'A' is much greater, not considering that most people being murdered are those who are out partying at three in the morning or selling drugs or committing crimes and if you are not, the risk you run is considerably lower. I almost felt like the last part of the book was penned by a different author. 400 pages of brilliance though."""

But in 2018, I was trying to nourish my attention span by reading 20 pages a day. Thus I'm trying to pick it again and the payoff is pretty well. Generally, it's not a uninteresting book to be started with but it's not the kind of book you could read in one go. The whole books revolve around the two systems (figurative speaking ) of the brain, system 1 and system 2 which influence our habits, decisions which could lead to individual success for some people. This book is my very first book about psychology and I really like about they're trying extract conclusions from the given data rather than hindsight assumption. "

It did not particularly long for me to come around to read it afterwards and I am really glad I did. Not everything in this book is new, but how the author explains our different modes of thinking - the automated ""system 1"" which does the fast thinking and the slower, effortful ""system 2"" which monitors system 1 but tends to be lazy. After differentiating between the two a lot of time is spent on different types of biases which make us interpret situations incorrectly. Absolutely fascinating.

645,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818089-jurgen-appelo,4,A very important book. Everyone should read it. But 1 point off for being so terribly repetitive.
646,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4799169-olga,3,"After an initial entry description, this book is basically a catalogue of findings in behavioral economics. I appreciated the fact that it skipped many of the obligatory filler stories that most science writers use to turn articles into books, and I found the book very well edited, with a clear organization by theme and subtheme. That said, if you read Scientific American or any other popular publication, you won't find anything new here.What strikes me as interesting about the book (and behavioral economics in general) is that they are rarely self-consistent in their assumptions. The reasons claimed for why some heuristics are biases actually undermine or help explain the reasons given for why other heuristics are biases.Example: Kahneman describes that emotionally salient examples are given excess weight (ie My next door neighbor was robbed one time vs. none of my other neighbors were ever robbed in their 20+ years of living in the building). Additionally, the availability bias is that people give too much weight to recent events and to ones that pop easily into mind.However, another ""bias"" discussed is that we're more likely to use ""logical,"" ""system 2"" thinking when we are emotionally charged up, and that type 1 thinking tends to dominate casual situations. So doesn't that mean that emotionally salient examples are more likely to be based on rigorously examined evidence? After all, I read every article about my robbed neighbo's plight, but I'm really just relaying what I was told about the rest of my neighbors. As for availability, isn't it just a proxy for quantity of evidence, which Kahneman later argues that we don't consider.Example 2: The affect ""bias"" means that we're more likely to believe something associated with positive feelings than with negative ones, even if the feeling is unrelated to the context. But then, the exposure effect means that we grow to feel good about things that we've heard before, even if we don't register them. So it would be fairly irrational to not consider affect, given that the reasons you feel good about something might stem from an unconscious memory that you've *actually* encountered it before.A separate problem is that it's not always clear that an experimental finding represents a separate bias and not just a proxy for a previously described one, but I'll leave examples of this out for the sake of brevity.***THE BIGGER PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS***:First, why on earth would it be rational for humans to expand limited mental energy, which is necessarily scarce due to computing constraints, to go through constant system 2 thinking? It may not be rational in terms of error avoidance to make these errors, but rationality is about both *costs* and *benefits*, and the cost of error is well worth it if the benefits of getting things right is small, which is true for most cases.Second, none of these experiments tell us anything about what people conclude from OBSERVATIONS, but only about STATEMENTS. I strongly suspect that when people hear a sentence or a question, they mentally imagine that some *person* is making that statement or posing that question.But people are motivated beings who make statements intentionally. We naturally expect them to have reasons to say things why one way and not another.Consider: If somebody actually asked you whether Ghandi was younger or older than 144 years old when he dies, you would assume that they have a reason for the high number, most likely based on some previous fact that they know. If you didn't take that into account, you would be disregarding probable evidence that another person has. So the famous Linda example is not totally irrational. If your best friend was asking you the questions about her profession, you would assume that he or she is just drawing random examples when making simple statements, but is acting on some background information in the compound statement. From a purely linguistic point of view, people very rarely use injuctions when they have no background information.For example compre your friend saying: ""I don't know any French, but I'm guessing that the word ""mon amour"" means my male lover,"" to ""Ditto on French, but I'm guessing that ""amour"" is the male person to whom the speaker feels intense romance coupled with commitment, contrasted with ""mon amant,"" which described more sexual and fleeting love."" It sure seems like your friend has at least *some* background knowledge in the latter case, the caveat to the contrary.Applying the idea of an intentional speaker to Linda: If somebody said that Linda might be a bank teller active in the feminist movement, it sounds like the speaker is basing the hypothesis on greater prior knowledge than someone who just talked about one of those things. This can also be applied to anchoring (Why *did* the auctioneer start off with that price? He's probably basing it on his experience about what people might be willing to pay."") including presentation (soda sizes are probably based on market research about what people are willing to consume). It also applies to framing. If somebody said that ""10% died,"" it might be assumed that there is a reason why the speaker is choosing to draw attention to the nonrepresentative cases. Maybe their deaths were particularly gruesome, or there's some special reason why you might be in it.I'm not finished with the book, but these are my preliminary thoughts on Kahneman's book. Overall, it's a good summary work, but nothing earth shattering so far."
647,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,5,"Edit 17th February 2017:Here's another looong blog post which goes through the studies cited by Kahneman and finds that most of them are underpowered: these studies have been run on so few students that the results they show could be wrong. As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:
What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies. [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.
Edit 5th July 2016:This interesting recent blog post looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.
It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.Old review 2014:In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate. We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists. Politicians.tl;dr"

656,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book examines the psychology of decision making. It draws attention to common mistakes, illusions, and how we can help people to make better decisions, for example, by framing questions better. This is a very thought provoking and important book, however it gets tedious and overly long in parts, especially in the second half. Human’s make decisions in two fundamental ways: the fast, intuitive way, and the slow, rational way. Kahneman calls this system 1 and system 2. He says this makes it easy to remember - but it took me forever... until I figured that the Fast system comes first. He could have just called it fast system and slow system... this is rather irritating as the main point of his book is humans often make mistakes in decision making and need some help to “nudge” them in the right direction. You know, like using easy to remember terminology... but I digress.System 1 is very helpful as we can run away from the lion as soon as we perceive it, without having to weigh factors like the size of the lion, how far it is, how hungry it looks, etc. But it can give us the wrong intuition in cases we actually need to engage system 2 - the slow, rational part, that is needed for complex decisions. We are lazy and try to avoid invoking system 2 as much as possible. This often leads to things like substituting a complex question with an easier one, and answering that one. For example, people might just vote for a candidate that looks the part, without thinking in detail about their qualifications and stands on issues. This book draws our attention to common ways our intuitions can betray us. As Kahneman states, we will stay just as likely to make those mistakes, but in certain cases where such mistakes are common, we can learn to be wary of danger and invoke system 2. He details and gives names to many phenomenons - I will list a few below. I have listened on audio, and fair warning - there are many terms that do not stick well just listening. I have to now dig up my Kindle for those, so rest of review to come."
657,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,1,"There's something almost amusingly ironic about a book which purports to explain how the brain works written by someone clearly lacking in self-awareness.Having watched Horizon's documentary: ""How You Really Think"" and finding the basic idea interesting, but the detail somewhat weak, I thought maybe the book would be better. I was wrong.The premise of the book, that our brain is divided into two systems: system 1 for fast, intuitive thinking; system 2 for detailed, analytical thinking is both attractive and superficially reasonable. Unfortunately, it's also too simple and the author's mistake is that he takes it as almost a complete blueprint for human beings, not just failing to take into account the impact of learning on intuition, but rejecting it outright. This leads him to some improbable claims: for example, treating the association of tattoos to the lower orders as if it were some kind of genetic programming, when anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of cultural history would be aware the tattoos started as a trapping of a societal elite and only gained their current associations gradually. And it's clear that Kahneman himself isn't entirely confident in his theory. Not only does admit that it isn't widely accepted in the field, at various points he attempts to bludgeon the reader into accepting as gospel some wild piece of speculation by accusing doubters of being everything from depressed to autistic. And yet the book is filled with demonstrably flawed research and spurious conclusions. Some statements, like the idea that people struggle to hold six-digit numbers in short term memory (something I do every day as part of my job) or that it's not possible to walk quickly and think at the same time, are just the author projecting his own limitations onto his audience, others show more serious failings.So, for example, in a section on how a bias can be created by ""priming"" the subject with information, he talks about a paper which demonstrates how people exposed to money are apparently likely to be mean and then congratulates the author of the paper for not hammering the obvious conclusion home (giving the impression he has merely been primed to come to that conclusion himself). At another point, talking about sample sizes, he makes a sweeping statement that even statisticians are likely to underestimate the right sample size for a statistical study to be valid - his grounds, a straw poll of handily available statisticians with no information on the sample size involved. Another study which ""proves"" that people don't come to the aid of a man having a seizure if they think someone else is around fails to take into account that people might not know how to deal with a seizure and the results might differ if all participants had first-aid training. The author leaps to conclusions like a frog to lily-pads, only with less grace. The language of the book is desperate, pleading to be taken seriously, angry when it's clearly not going to happen. The strange business-speak quotes at the end of each section seem pointless and irritating, the tests presuppose the inability of a participant to admit they don't know an answer rather than simply guessing.The second half of the book relegates the system 1/2 division to the status of an accepted norm as it talks about a concept called prospect theory, which supposedly regulates our ability to judge risky decisions. Again, the idea is interesting, but there are too many claims made without apparent evidence and even some of the basic statements don't square up. That any theory of risk can fail to take into account the marginal utility of the prospective losses and gains seems over-simplistic. That it dismisses the risk aversion which would make many - myself included - reject almost any bet is unforgivable. I've no doubt there are basic rules which influence the way people judge risk, but to take them out of context and assume they are universally applicable is too naive to be credible.Part of the problem with any study of psychology, of course, is that the selection of test subjects is invariably less than scientific. Where political opinion polling has evolved to the point where a well-selected cross-section of the population can give a reasonably accurate indicator (although one which can still be completely wrong - see the 1992 UK election), psychological studies are invariably stuck with whoever will volunteer. This means that Kahneman's theory may hold for the kind of people who get involved in studies, but not for the population as a whole. Even amongst a self-selecting sample it's too simple and unscientific to lump everyone together.Fundamentally, I think this is the problem with this book. A good psychology book presents the reader with tools to understand why a particular person behaves in the way they do; this book suggests there are tools to predict that behaviour. Classic behavioural psychology would, for example, pick up on the scattered references to marriage in this book and see a pattern where an author who is married to a woman whom he clearly sees as an intellectual inferior nonetheless finds that she doesn't always accept his opinion as fact, leaving him a lot less happy than he was on his wedding day. Kahneman, meanwhile, thinks he can tell you how you'll vote in the presidential election based on photographs of the candidates. When the winner of the presidential election is a tall, square-jawed strongman then it may appear that Kaheman has a point, but ask yourself this: why doesn't he ever get 100% of the vote?"

If you want to avoid ever being gulled or shanghai-ed by a magician, con-artist, advertiser or politician, this book is for you!Daniel Kahnemann, for the purposes of Thinking, Fast and Slow, reduces the brain to System 1 and System 2 - essentially the automatic brain and the voluntary brain. It is a great over-simplification, as he himself concedes - more so, even, than the common reduction to id, ego and superego. As a heuristic device, though, it enables him to illustrate some fascinating truths about the brain in a clear and understandable way, supported by abundant examples and descriptions of experiments. The lessons elicited are so profound I found myself re-reading chapters on numerous occasions to absorb them as completely as possible.To whet the appetite with a non-spoiler, consider the following: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow is an outstanding book"".Regardless of whether you now choose to believe the above statement or not, your automatic brain (""System 1"") believed the sentence straight away, as it was able to form a coherent picture from it. To un-believe it requires the conscious effort of your voluntary brain (""System 2""). The implications of this simple lesson barely need elaborating - they are quite staggering, even more so if you consider that, if System 2 is distracted, it may not intervene. This forms part of the foundation of much advertising, not least the lavish reviews and copious stars adorning the covers of many an aspiring best-selling novel. We are prone to believe these things without questioning them. There are many revelatory lessons, such as the above, within the pages of this book, which is why it will be a must-read for many people.My principal reservation, as with most pop-psychology works, is one of a lack of wider context. You finish them feeling, for a short while, like a brain expert, and they seem happy to leave you with that impression. In reality, though, they barely dip their toes in the waters of all there is to know about the seat of our consciousness. To give one small illustration of how much remains to be learned: In the final neuroscience exam I sat at university there was a question - Why are there so many neurotransmitters? (these are the chemicals that are used to transfer nerve signals between brain cells - there are over 100). The answer? ... Nobody knows. Construction of plausible hypotheses based on the sparse evidence available was the best that could be done to tackle the question. To contemporary science, the brain is still essentially 'magic'. We haven't advanced much, in this respect, beyond what the ancient Greeks knew, but this wider contextual point is usually unfortunately downplayed, and I felt that was the case in this book. Kahnemann focuses on impressing us with the notable highlights of what we do know, thereby missing an opportunity to complement this by intriguing us with the far greater mysteries of what we don't.Another (very minor) criticism relates to sentences such as ""If you had been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger"" (my emphasis) - while admirably objective, they caused the text to seem too distant in places, making it difficult to place yourself in the shoes of the hypothetical subject. Another indirect illustration, perhaps, of the crudity of modern brain science in relation to its object of study (and instrument of investigation ... !).Thinking, Fast and Slow is a rewarding read for the pearls of wisdom within, but it's important not to forget that they are tiny pearls in a very deep ocean.Luke F. D. Marsden (Author of Wondering, the Way is Made)"
659,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, reveals many of the fallacies in our thinking, whether we are ordinary men and women or scientists, statisticians and policy makers. He partitions the thinking self into two entities with the generic names System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the intuitive part of our thinking self: the part that after training executes skills spontaneously; the part that generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations, which when endorsed by System 2 become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions. System 2 is the analytical part, which checks System 2 through critical analysis but which is often too lazy to act.  Decision TreeWhenever System 2 fails to check System 1, there is likely to be errors in our judgment, decisions, and thinking. Kahneman, through his research throughout the years with colleagues, discovered these thinking errors including heuristic and biases such as putting too much emphases on low probability events, being influenced by how a statement or question is framed, giving more weights (in terms of probabilities) to incidences that we are familiar with or that are dramatic, ignoring base rates and focusing only on the representative features of event or person to decide probabilities. Other fallacies are overconfidence through the illusion of understanding, where through hindsight we create artificial items for success (successful companies, CEOs, startups, etc); through the illusion of validity where the environment is so “noisy” that practitioners have difficulty mastering the skill (stock picking); through neglecting the outside view (the base rate) and only focusing on what is in front of us. Also, we make bad decisions because we are not the rational individuals that utility theory, decision theory, and other economic theories presupposes (we don’t maximize expected utilities because emotions such as fear from System 1 interferes).  Normal DistributionIn general, System 1 is useful in our day-to-day lives since the shortcuts that we have developed over our lifetimes saves time and mental energy. However, at key moments, we must recognize that these shortcuts will harm rather than help us. By pointing out these fallacies, by turning these “unknown unknowns” into “known unknowns” Kahneman has alerted us to the tendencies for us to prejudge, to under-plan, to ignore the bird’s eye view, to select the wrong path, etc. Now that we are aware of the danger, we must design formal structures or informal alarms to guard against these fallacies. Since they affect personal finance, individual happiness, as well as national policies and international economics, we can’t afford to avoid them. Overcoming these fallacies will improve our individual, national, and global wellbeing.

I cannot emphasize more on reading this book before all the others!Over small chapters spread over the entire book, nobel prize winner Kahneman goes on to describe initially how system 1 (subconscious) and your system 2 (conscious) work. He describes that how most of our choices in normal life are governed by subconscious because system 2 is lazy and he gave many examples around it.Reversion to the mean was a tremendous mind-opener. As also was choice making section where he describes the peak-end vs time biases where we tend to say that this guys life was successful because he reached to such a success height and his end was happy rather than integrating happiness vs time which would sort of be a better measure for success. This happens because our long term memory tends to remember the peak and end more than overall time experience because they're the strong memory points.One part which I found was wrong was Kahneman's belief in efficient market theory. It was ironic that after mentioning so many biases, he found the question of predicting the future very defined by the asset pricing. But, he more than made by the rest of the content.A JEWEL!"

Kahneman calls them System 1 (the intuitive) and System 2 (the (seemingly) rational) and goes into interesting details about how they interact. He writes about intuitive judgements and how we get them wrong; about probability and how we get it wrong; about cost/benefit analysis and how we get it wrong; about our memory of the past and how we get it wrong.The ideas are not new, but they are definitely mind-blowing if you haven't encountered them before.

Probably in two decades.Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about two distinct modes of thinking - the ""fast"" intuitive thinking that dominates much of what we do and the slow, effort-demanding, conceptual thinking that we can bring to bear. It does this in amazing, and I suspect original, detail.Superficially, the book is about cognitive biases, various forms of error and a psychological, rather than philosophical, look at volition. More deeply, it really gives an impression of what focus means and patterns of applying it so well that I believe that for most people it will be ""the best book about"" the half dozen or so things that he or she really cares about. It so startlingly illuminates some basic facts about thinking that you'll inevitably apply it to the things that you care about and understand them better because you understand the actors better.Everyone should read this book.2016: I picked as much up from the second reading as the first.

Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, unloads a layman-friendly overview of decades of behavioral economics research. He's not quite as entertaining as his colleague Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational), but what he lacks in showmanship he makes up for in volume. The lessons learned here have practical application in managing people, creating public policy, teaching, negotiating, marketing, shopping, buying insurance, planning your vacation, choosing your spouse and raising your children. I intend to return to this book frequently and call upon its takeaways often. There is a wealth of new vocabulary terms that ought to be made an ordinary part of watercooler conversation.

It's kind of amazing that he's couched a book on decision making using statistics in the context of fast and slow thinking. The more into statistics you are the easier this book will be to absorb.System 1 - Fast - This might be what one refers to you nearly unconscious judgements. This will attempt to process, answer, and understand any question choice or otherwise as quickly as possible. System 2 - Slow - This requires more cognitive horse power. It must be activated on purpose. You get tired if you over use this. Then there is this concept of ""Flow""P. 41 ""Riding a motorcycle at 150 miles an hour and playing a competitive game of chess are certainly effortful. IN a state of flow, howevere, maintainig focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at ahand. The mind is a pattern maker and will make things that are not related related. This was discovered by Hume. in 1945 (p. 76). He gives the example that if you animate lights such that one is still and the other is moving, but when the still one is touched by the moving the two switch and the still one continues in the same path, then the mind will attribute cause to the moving light. The point is you know that the lights are animated and the real cause is the animator. You're mind however, will represent that light one caused light 2 to move. Fascinating.Chapter 9 drives home the point that it is uncomfortable to be stumped and need to use System 2. It more or less goes through all the cognitive biases we have just so we don't have eto use System 2.I like this end point of Chapter 16. He attempts to drive home how hard headed most humans are. Even if we know the statistical answer we will not truly integrate that into decisions made. P. 174. People who are taught surprising statistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the point of telling their friends what they have heard, but this does not mean that their world has actually changed. The chapter gives the example of how someone having a stroke does not elicit a bunch of people willing to help, because in actuality most will not get involved if they think someone else might take care of it. I like it because if you consider such biases in the discrimination issues of today, it really points out something fascinating. I'll try to think more on that when i have time. Chapter 22 is interesting in that he attempts to address the issue of expert intuition. In some ways this speaks directly to the book Blink. It would be interesting to have them face off. First, we define expert as someone who has literally seen every variation and understands it, a la master chess player. They are not intuiting. They are exercising the skill. But then then the question comes in whether they know what they don't know. Hard to say. But I do like the idea that expert is a host of skills that are complementary together. p.241 - ""Expertise is not a single skill; it is a collection of skills, and the same professional may be highly expert in some of the tasks in her domain while remaining a novice in others."" The next few chapters speak to risk and the biases of optimism and the like. Very cool stuff. (Emotional, cognitive, and social factors that bias risk).The ultimate conclusion is that we should attempt to fight errors of System 1. How...P. 417 - ""recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2.""I also wonder if women and minorities are socialized in the work place to be better at this. Not the point of this guy's book though, but fascinating nonetheless.Point of view is everything in this book. He goes through more detail about each of the biases illustrated in the field of decision making. It's a worthwhile read. Context is everything. In this book, the idea of regression is that it is correct, but misinterpretted (a flawed understanding of regression to the mean). I speak specifically about Appendix A, p. 424. He's right. Inference is often a problem. But I typically use the same think to describe the idea that the data is misunderstood, so inference is always wrong. Also, I likely am more intrigued by the idea that average isn't a real thing. I think Kanneman is game on this, but it's outside the scope of the book.Learned a lot, not the least of which, is how to present quite technical stats in a way that might make you read about it. "

The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking.

It repeats questions and concepts and anecdotes but typically doesn't mention the previous instance of the topic. So by the end you are kind of on your own for a framework of holding it together.The conclusion is there with its framing device - experience versus remembering, humans versus econs, system 1 versus system 2. And the papers are there, which are really the entire book in in microcosm. But its still not enough.As a reference, this book probably does work - the chapters are short and well named.

Not to say that the book is bad or uninteresting but rather the majority of the concepts in the book are things I've learned in business/psychology classes. That being said, this book is a nice tidy summary of a lot of these ideas (how bias work, how humans are bad at stats, how our thinking can be influenced).I did go ahead and read the whole book in search of the nuggets of new info and here are some of the things I found and really liked:* Willpower is like a muscle that you build up. When you're mentally tired it's much easier to give in. And people who are cognitively busy are more likely to make selfish choices.* Money primes individualism* Being exposed to phrases/names a lot leads us to believe them* The font size/color influence how much we believe text* It's hard for us to accept that a lot of life is random (as opposed to skill)* Regression to the mean - a really powerful concept of how people who do above their average will likely regress to their average next time around. People who are below their average will likely do better next time around.* Narrative fallacy - We love stories and tend to believe them as we draw causal inferences* People will pay a premium to transfer risk to the rich (insurance policies)It should be noted, that this whole book was about the author's experiments and not all of them have successfully been reproduced. The Undoing Project is a book I have yet to read that rebutts a lot of the ideas put forth in this book."
684,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5154953-lisa-taylor,4,"This was a really interesting book. Thinking Fast and Slow is the culmination of years of Daniel Kahneman’s research into the nature of human decision making, how our minds process the world around us, and basically how people think. From the very start the reader must realize how difficult of a subject this is to explore and understand, let alone explain. Simply by being human, any researcher working on this has to keep in mind that he is prey to the very biases he is working to uncover.This book was organized and written very well. Kahneman divides the human mind into two systems from the very beginning, giving these systems traits and tendencies to help us relate to them in ourselves. System 1 is the fast and intuitive thinking, or (if I may generalize here) our subconscious thoughts; our automatic reactions, feelings and impressions. System 2 is our rational system; the one that is often more accurate, but takes up much more energy to use. Most of us can see those two “systems” within ourselves, and that makes the book easy to follow. He often brings up points that seem arbitrary only to have them neatly tied together to create a larger concept a chapter or two later.I feel like this book was created for those who tend to be of a less scientific mind. He uses examples of experiments very often in the book that seem on the surface to prove his point, but I often wondered about the details of the experiments, which were never included. Now don’t get me wrong; I know nothing about Kahneman’s career and have no reason to think he does not do his research as scientifically as possible; that information just isn’t included in the book. This is an overall explanation of what his research has led him to conclude; if you’re looking for details and numbers and results so you can reach your own conclusion, you won’t find it here. For example:He wrote about an experiment where subjects heard various groups of words, then had to walk down a hallway to another room to do the second part of the experiment. The actual experiment was how long it took them to walk down the hall. Some people were given words that related to older people, disabilities, and generally being slow while other people were given words that related to young people, fitness, and generally being fast. People who were given the “slow words” took a significantly longer amount of time to walk the distance of the hall than those given the “fast words.” That’s really all he tells the reader because that is all he needs to make his point. And reading that, it is very easy to jump to the conclusion “wow, just hearing words can change our actions” because it’s interesting. He doesn’t answer questions like: Could the words have evoked different themes in different people’s minds? Was a background of the subjects taken to determine their general mood? Were the fast words speeding people up or the slow words slowing people down? How do you know this doesn’t only work with certain themes? Etc.My point is, take Thinking Fast and Slow with a grain of salt. The book is fun to read in the way that personality tests are fun; it’s always neat to learn more about ourselves, and it fulfills that somewhat narcissistic need in the reader. But that’s system 1 thinking; if you go into this wanting proof, you won’t get it. This is a subject very difficult to study objectively, and while I’m sure he did the job as well as possible, you can’t know that by reading his book because he does not give details, he gives his conclusions. And who can blame him? You don’t sell a book by filling it with numbers, you sell it by making it easy to understand – and when you get into such cutting edge research, there just isn’t a way to make it widely accessible and include all the nitty gritty details.I do believe this book is a very important stepping stone. Kahneman’s research is just one step toward understanding the human mind. I think many of the experiments he talks about are not enough to draw conclusions, although he does the best that he can. Scientists will continue the same path of research he has taken for centuries to come, and his ideas will be expanded on, accepted or thrown out as we learn more. This isn’t absolute truth. But if you are interested in where we stand on understanding the human mind and what theories are out there, then this book will be invaluable to you.I do not in any way think reading it is a waste of time since the ideas will most certainly change. Throughout the book he points out many of the common illusions that people fall prey to because of certain biases in our minds, and even if he doesn’t have the processes behind them exactly right (who can really know if he does or not?), that doesn’t mean the illusions aren’t real. Everyone can benefit from reading this book simply by being made aware of these pitfalls and therefore being able to avoid them in the future.So, what do I think? He went a little light on the explanations, and I wish he had provided more of the scientific details about his work. However, I understand that the book is already lengthy and so he may not have had much choice. I do absolutely recommend this book for any non-fiction readers interested in psychology or in improving their own thought processes."

And the little games and examples that helped to see for myself that the biases and ‘brain tricks’ the authors are talking about are true. What I disliked about it: The length of it. I was listening to the audiobook and, honestly, after around 15 hours I stopped paying much attention and allowed it to play in the background. The repetitiveness. I felt like the authors had few major points and they just kept on going at them in various different ways. The fact that I didn’t get much out of it. I just finished listening to it and already don’t remember much. "
686,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90686289-venera-arakelyan,5,"To summarize:1. Our brain has 2 systems: fast intuitive and slow analytical. 2. Our brain wants to take the path of least resistance, which called Cognitive Ease.3. When faced with a difficult question, we answer a cognitively easier one. As a marketer we need to remember about this while runing surveys. 4. 'What you see is all there is' . From marketers perspective this is to justify things like branding or awareness campaigns.5. Our opinion can be changed depending on how the question/statement was. For example, which one do you think will sell better? 90% fat-free VS 10% fat?6. When judging likelihood we over value what 'Feels' right and undervalue statistics. 7. We hate the idea of 'wasting ' what we have already put in."
687,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31999040-shea-levy,0,"Overall I really enjoyed this book. Kahneman is an engaging writer and brings in a wealth of information to construct a compelling narrative. I'd been aware of a lot of this literature and the overall framework beforehand, but I still learned a lot in terms of specifics and got a much better sense of the details of the system 1/system 2 model and how broadly applicable it is. If you want a glimpse of what kind of understanding psychology can offer of how we reason and evaluate, I definitely recommend this one.I had some minor nits throughout and disagreed with a few of his interpretations, but the significant detractor was the framing Kahneman chose for the book. He made some choices seemingly to promote his goal of influencing water cooler conversation (which by itself seemed strange to me) that I think weakened chances for understanding. The biggest one was the discussion of the separate categories of thought processes as separate systems with their own agency and personalities. Kahneman acknowledges this as a fiction explicitly, but that didn't seem to mitigate the confusion that I think might result. I do think there's a true and useful categorization underneath the system 1/system 2 distinction, but treating them as completely distinct and partially at odds obfuscates the deeply intertwined and inseparable nature of the processes. One particular recurrent issue that resulted from this was identifying system 2 with the self and then concluding (at several different points) things along the lines of ""you don't really know/decide/etc. most things, that's sneaky old System 1"". And ascribing judgmental personality traits to the systems (e.g. ""system 2 is lazy"" instead of ""effortful thinking is costly"") may help the reader from an intuitive impression of them, but with a strong bias toward oversimplification and negative evaluation.More minorly, Kahneman also usually leaves out details like how strong the effects noted are, what proportion of the subjects were affected, etc. seemingly out of a desire to craft a coherent picture that applies wholly to the reader. One of the times where he does include some of this information this gets particularly ridiculous: In one paragraph on page 171 he mentions that ""only four of the fifteen participants [in the ""helping experiment""] responded immediately to the appeal for help,"" and in the next says ""even normal, decent people do not rush to help when they expect others to take on the unpleasantness of dealing with a seizure. And that means you, too."". 4/15 is pretty bad given the issue at hand, but if that generalizes it emphatically doesn't mean ""you"" for more than 1 in 4 of the readers! Many of the errors he mentioned I could easily identify in myself, some of them I have evidence for thinking they don't apply as strongly as he claims (e.g. actually having been in a few diffusion of responsibility type scenarios and taking action), and for the rest I simply have no way to judge likelihood without diving into the references. I think adding in these details would have gone a long way to forming a more accurate understanding in the reader, but I have an uncharitable suspicion that it would also have significantly weakened some of the cases he was making.All that being said, I really did enjoy this book and by the end couldn't put it down. Kahneman clearly knows his stuff and I'm much better informed having read it. I've already taken steps to try to incorporate some of the lessons into my thinking and decision making, and definitely plan to seek out more in this domain."
688,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"I am familiar with Daniel Kahneman's work through many of his essays and articles in various magazines in the past. I had always found them thought-provoking, interesting and challenging established notions. That is why I was excited to read this book on Behavioral psychology by him. However, this book lived up to my expectations only partially. One reason is that the author's contention that 'our intuitive preferences are more influential than rational choice' gets well established fairly early in the book through the many experiments that he describes. Consequently, I felt a sense of repetition in the latter half of the book and gradually felt that the book lost steam completely towards the closing sections.To put it simply, the book says that there are two systems which drive the way we think and make choices. The author calls them System 1 and System 2. System 1 is intuitive, quick and influenced by emotion. System 2 is slower, rational, logical and reflective. The author's research says that System 1 is more influential than what our experience tells us and it is the subliminal determinant of the many choices and judgments that we make. This is contrary to our general belief that we are very rational in our decision-making. The many example experiments that the book outlines show us that we must really be a lot more watchful in the assurance with which we trust our decisions as rooted in rationality. To me, this is the biggest lesson from the book.A few other points of interest from the book are:1. Luck plays a large role in every story of success. The author illustrates it with the telling contemporary example of the founders of Google willing to sell their company for less than $1 million but the buyer thought that the price was too high!2. High intelligence does not make people immune to biases3. Rationality should be distinguished from intelligence.4. While talking about the consequences of Priming, the author points to a conclusion that may be an indictment of capitalist society. He says that living in a culture that surrounds us with constant reminders of money may shape our behavior and attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.5. On the subject of Intuition vs Formulas, the author quotes a memorable formula of researcher Robyn Dawes:Marital Stability = frequency of lovemaking - frequency of quarrels!6. In the final section of the book, titled 'Two Selves', the author dabbles into the question of human happiness. Two statements caught my attention.a. The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?b. There is low correlation between individuals' circumstances and their satisfaction with life. The reason is that both experienced happiness and life satisfaction are largely determined by the genetics of temperament.In this context, I wondered whether the author is aware of Friedrich Nietzsche's contention that animals are happy because they lack a capacity for past memories. Perhaps the author's term 'genetics of temperament' include a capacity to forget the past and move on with life.I found it educational and interesting in parts but somewhat disappointing overall, given my initial expectations from the author."
689,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40437278-miebara-jato,5,"In 1979, Kahneman with his longtime collaborator, Late Amos Tversky published their groundbreaking academic paper, “Prospect Theory” (which was further updated in 1992). It was a buzz in the academic world. Kahneman who later went on to receive Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 is the first psychologist to earn the prize in that category. Kahneman sequenced into a book hundreds of research papers spanning over 30 years on decision making he wrote with his intellectual friend and collaborator, Tversky. Thinking Fast and Slow is his seminal work on the topic of decision making and cognitive bias.Thinking Fast and Slow is a dense, technical but rewarding read. The book exhaustively discussed biases and fallacies people are prone to make. He talks about the halo effect, affection bias, and confirmation biases. The crux of the book is on cognitive biases, yeah.Humans are said to be “rational beings.” That we are capable of making rational and logical choices. But Kahneman argues it is not always so. “Humans beings,” he insists, “are prone to make illogical choices. We rely so much on statistics, numbers, or information. We are quick at even saying “numbers don’t lie.’ Because we think along those lines, when we are fed with information about a particular issue, we start to feel that it is true or even concludes it has a higher likelihood of reoccurrence. We also make an intuitive judgment based on the information that is available. Kahneman is warning us to be careful with such information in our swaying judgment. It is what he calls the availability syndrome. Making judgments on how likely an event will happen based on how easy it is to think of an example. Availability doesn't equate to truth, he cautioned. Coming to the mind, he wrote that we think with two systems, system 1 and system 2. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. System 2, on the other hand, is slower, analytical, deliberative, and logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. Kahneman also shows that we tend to place more value on what we currently own more than it’s real economic value. He called it the “endowment effect”. With the endowment effect, our economic decisions are made through the lens of opportunity costs. The other key concept extensively discussed in the book is “Loss Aversion” or status quo bias. That is, we work harder not to lose something than we will gain something. Losing something pains twice than the joy of winning. All-in-all, this book is a must-read for everyone. I cannot recommend it highly enough. All-in-all, this book is a must-read for everyone. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
690,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36401880-sagar-acharya,5,"This is by far the best book I've ever read. I cannot emphasize more on reading this book before all the others!Over small chapters spread over the entire book, nobel prize winner Kahneman goes on to describe initially how system 1 (subconscious) and your system 2 (conscious) work. He describes that how most of our choices in normal life are governed by subconscious because system 2 is lazy and he gave many examples around it.Reversion to the mean was a tremendous mind-opener. As also was choice making section where he describes the peak-end vs time biases where we tend to say that this guys life was successful because he reached to such a success height and his end was happy rather than integrating happiness vs time which would sort of be a better measure for success. This happens because our long term memory tends to remember the peak and end more than overall time experience because they're the strong memory points.One part which I found was wrong was Kahneman's belief in efficient market theory. It was ironic that after mentioning so many biases, he found the question of predicting the future very defined by the asset pricing. But, he more than made by the rest of the content.A JEWEL!"

And it's A-MA-ZING.The ""fast"" and ""slow"" in the title are references to what has been traditionally (and incorrectly) called ""Right hemisphere"" and ""Left hemisphere"" (also R-mode and L-mode). Kahneman calls them System 1 (the intuitive) and System 2 (the (seemingly) rational) and goes into interesting details about how they interact. He writes about intuitive judgements and how we get them wrong; about probability and how we get it wrong; about cost/benefit analysis and how we get it wrong; about our memory of the past and how we get it wrong.The ideas are not new, but they are definitely mind-blowing if you haven't encountered them before. They are presented with great examples.

Probably in two decades.Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about two distinct modes of thinking - the ""fast"" intuitive thinking that dominates much of what we do and the slow, effort-demanding, conceptual thinking that we can bring to bear. It does this in amazing, and I suspect original, detail.Superficially, the book is about cognitive biases, various forms of error and a psychological, rather than philosophical, look at volition. More deeply, it really gives an impression of what focus means and patterns of applying it so well that I believe that for most people it will be ""the best book about"" the half dozen or so things that he or she really cares about. It so startlingly illuminates some basic facts about thinking that you'll inevitably apply it to the things that you care about and understand them better because you understand the actors better.Everyone should read this book.2016: I picked as much up from the second reading as the first.

Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, unloads a layman-friendly overview of decades of behavioral economics research. He's not quite as entertaining as his colleague Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational), but what he lacks in showmanship he makes up for in volume. The lessons learned here have practical application in managing people, creating public policy, teaching, negotiating, marketing, shopping, buying insurance, planning your vacation, choosing your spouse and raising your children. I intend to return to this book frequently and call upon its takeaways often. There is a wealth of new vocabulary terms that ought to be made an ordinary part of watercooler conversation.

It's kind of amazing that he's couched a book on decision making using statistics in the context of fast and slow thinking. The more into statistics you are the easier this book will be to absorb.System 1 - Fast - This might be what one refers to you nearly unconscious judgements. This will attempt to process, answer, and understand any question choice or otherwise as quickly as possible. System 2 - Slow - This requires more cognitive horse power. It must be activated on purpose. You get tired if you over use this. Then there is this concept of ""Flow""P. 41 ""Riding a motorcycle at 150 miles an hour and playing a competitive game of chess are certainly effortful. IN a state of flow, howevere, maintainig focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at ahand. The mind is a pattern maker and will make things that are not related related. This was discovered by Hume. in 1945 (p. 76). He gives the example that if you animate lights such that one is still and the other is moving, but when the still one is touched by the moving the two switch and the still one continues in the same path, then the mind will attribute cause to the moving light. The point is you know that the lights are animated and the real cause is the animator. You're mind however, will represent that light one caused light 2 to move. Fascinating.Chapter 9 drives home the point that it is uncomfortable to be stumped and need to use System 2. It more or less goes through all the cognitive biases we have just so we don't have eto use System 2.I like this end point of Chapter 16. He attempts to drive home how hard headed most humans are. Even if we know the statistical answer we will not truly integrate that into decisions made. P. 174. People who are taught surprising statistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the point of telling their friends what they have heard, but this does not mean that their world has actually changed. The chapter gives the example of how someone having a stroke does not elicit a bunch of people willing to help, because in actuality most will not get involved if they think someone else might take care of it. I like it because if you consider such biases in the discrimination issues of today, it really points out something fascinating. I'll try to think more on that when i have time. Chapter 22 is interesting in that he attempts to address the issue of expert intuition. In some ways this speaks directly to the book Blink. It would be interesting to have them face off. First, we define expert as someone who has literally seen every variation and understands it, a la master chess player. They are not intuiting. They are exercising the skill. But then then the question comes in whether they know what they don't know. Hard to say. But I do like the idea that expert is a host of skills that are complementary together. p.241 - ""Expertise is not a single skill; it is a collection of skills, and the same professional may be highly expert in some of the tasks in her domain while remaining a novice in others."" The next few chapters speak to risk and the biases of optimism and the like. Very cool stuff. (Emotional, cognitive, and social factors that bias risk).The ultimate conclusion is that we should attempt to fight errors of System 1. How...P. 417 - ""recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2.""I also wonder if women and minorities are socialized in the work place to be better at this. Not the point of this guy's book though, but fascinating nonetheless.Point of view is everything in this book. He goes through more detail about each of the biases illustrated in the field of decision making. It's a worthwhile read. Context is everything. In this book, the idea of regression is that it is correct, but misinterpretted (a flawed understanding of regression to the mean). I speak specifically about Appendix A, p. 424. He's right. Inference is often a problem. But I typically use the same think to describe the idea that the data is misunderstood, so inference is always wrong. Also, I likely am more intrigued by the idea that average isn't a real thing. I think Kanneman is game on this, but it's outside the scope of the book.Learned a lot, not the least of which, is how to present quite technical stats in a way that might make you read about it. "

Also: when it comes to many luck-based scenarios, the ""experts"" are often only slightly more efficient at guessing than the average layperson.It definitely left some interesting food for thought."
710,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110815090-young,5,"In the highly anticipated Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."

We got to together and talked about two chapters for a half an hour at lunch. With holidays this ended up taking 5 months, about the longest I can remember reading a specific book. It was a pretty awesome experience though I wish I retained more of the text and the discussion.This is a big, dense, brilliant book. But it does not build over time. It does not reference itself. It repeats questions and concepts and anecdotes but typically doesn't mention the previous instance of the topic. So by the end you are kind of on your own for a framework of holding it together.The conclusion is there with its framing device - experience versus remembering, humans versus econs, system 1 versus system 2. And the papers are there, which are really the entire book in in microcosm. But its still not enough.As a reference, this book probably does work - the chapters are short and well named. And it would probably work as a textbook, with the output being tests or papers. But leaving the reader educated could have been done better.But still the take-aways that I did retain were pretty interesting and almost certainly useful.So flawed but impressive. 4.5 of 5."
713,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27510691-ray,4,"Having heard about this book for several years I was quite excited to finally start it. However, found myself quickly bored. Not to say that the book is bad or uninteresting but rather the majority of the concepts in the book are things I've learned in business/psychology classes. That being said, this book is a nice tidy summary of a lot of these ideas (how bias work, how humans are bad at stats, how our thinking can be influenced).I did go ahead and read the whole book in search of the nuggets of new info and here are some of the things I found and really liked:* Willpower is like a muscle that you build up. When you're mentally tired it's much easier to give in. And people who are cognitively busy are more likely to make selfish choices.* Money primes individualism* Being exposed to phrases/names a lot leads us to believe them* The font size/color influence how much we believe text* It's hard for us to accept that a lot of life is random (as opposed to skill)* Regression to the mean - a really powerful concept of how people who do above their average will likely regress to their average next time around. People who are below their average will likely do better next time around.* Narrative fallacy - We love stories and tend to believe them as we draw causal inferences* People will pay a premium to transfer risk to the rich (insurance policies)It should be noted, that this whole book was about the author's experiments and not all of them have successfully been reproduced. The Undoing Project is a book I have yet to read that rebutts a lot of the ideas put forth in this book."
714,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5154953-lisa-taylor,4,"This was a really interesting book. Thinking Fast and Slow is the culmination of years of Daniel Kahneman’s research into the nature of human decision making, how our minds process the world around us, and basically how people think. From the very start the reader must realize how difficult of a subject this is to explore and understand, let alone explain. Simply by being human, any researcher working on this has to keep in mind that he is prey to the very biases he is working to uncover.This book was organized and written very well. Kahneman divides the human mind into two systems from the very beginning, giving these systems traits and tendencies to help us relate to them in ourselves. System 1 is the fast and intuitive thinking, or (if I may generalize here) our subconscious thoughts; our automatic reactions, feelings and impressions. System 2 is our rational system; the one that is often more accurate, but takes up much more energy to use. Most of us can see those two “systems” within ourselves, and that makes the book easy to follow. He often brings up points that seem arbitrary only to have them neatly tied together to create a larger concept a chapter or two later.I feel like this book was created for those who tend to be of a less scientific mind. He uses examples of experiments very often in the book that seem on the surface to prove his point, but I often wondered about the details of the experiments, which were never included. Now don’t get me wrong; I know nothing about Kahneman’s career and have no reason to think he does not do his research as scientifically as possible; that information just isn’t included in the book. This is an overall explanation of what his research has led him to conclude; if you’re looking for details and numbers and results so you can reach your own conclusion, you won’t find it here. For example:He wrote about an experiment where subjects heard various groups of words, then had to walk down a hallway to another room to do the second part of the experiment. The actual experiment was how long it took them to walk down the hall. Some people were given words that related to older people, disabilities, and generally being slow while other people were given words that related to young people, fitness, and generally being fast. People who were given the “slow words” took a significantly longer amount of time to walk the distance of the hall than those given the “fast words.” That’s really all he tells the reader because that is all he needs to make his point. And reading that, it is very easy to jump to the conclusion “wow, just hearing words can change our actions” because it’s interesting. He doesn’t answer questions like: Could the words have evoked different themes in different people’s minds? Was a background of the subjects taken to determine their general mood? Were the fast words speeding people up or the slow words slowing people down? How do you know this doesn’t only work with certain themes? Etc.My point is, take Thinking Fast and Slow with a grain of salt. The book is fun to read in the way that personality tests are fun; it’s always neat to learn more about ourselves, and it fulfills that somewhat narcissistic need in the reader. But that’s system 1 thinking; if you go into this wanting proof, you won’t get it. This is a subject very difficult to study objectively, and while I’m sure he did the job as well as possible, you can’t know that by reading his book because he does not give details, he gives his conclusions. And who can blame him? You don’t sell a book by filling it with numbers, you sell it by making it easy to understand – and when you get into such cutting edge research, there just isn’t a way to make it widely accessible and include all the nitty gritty details.I do believe this book is a very important stepping stone. Kahneman’s research is just one step toward understanding the human mind. I think many of the experiments he talks about are not enough to draw conclusions, although he does the best that he can. Scientists will continue the same path of research he has taken for centuries to come, and his ideas will be expanded on, accepted or thrown out as we learn more. This isn’t absolute truth. But if you are interested in where we stand on understanding the human mind and what theories are out there, then this book will be invaluable to you.I do not in any way think reading it is a waste of time since the ideas will most certainly change. Throughout the book he points out many of the common illusions that people fall prey to because of certain biases in our minds, and even if he doesn’t have the processes behind them exactly right (who can really know if he does or not?), that doesn’t mean the illusions aren’t real. Everyone can benefit from reading this book simply by being made aware of these pitfalls and therefore being able to avoid them in the future.So, what do I think? He went a little light on the explanations, and I wish he had provided more of the scientific details about his work. However, I understand that the book is already lengthy and so he may not have had much choice. I do absolutely recommend this book for any non-fiction readers interested in psychology or in improving their own thought processes."
715,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54320432-ieva-gr,3," Why I started reading it: This is one those books that you can see on the shelves of youtubers, in the posts of bookstagramers and the ‘to read’ lists of most your friends.What I liked about it: The idea of explaining in rather scientific terms why we are not as rational as we think. And the little games and examples that helped to see for myself that the biases and ‘brain tricks’ the authors are talking about are true. What I disliked about it: The length of it. I was listening to the audiobook and, honestly, after around 15 hours I stopped paying much attention and allowed it to play in the background. The repetitiveness. I felt like the authors had few major points and they just kept on going at them in various different ways. The fact that I didn’t get much out of it. I just finished listening to it and already don’t remember much. "
716,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90686289-venera-arakelyan,5,"To summarize:1. Our brain has 2 systems: fast intuitive and slow analytical. 2. Our brain wants to take the path of least resistance, which called Cognitive Ease.3. When faced with a difficult question, we answer a cognitively easier one. As a marketer we need to remember about this while runing surveys. 4. 'What you see is all there is' . From marketers perspective this is to justify things like branding or awareness campaigns.5. Our opinion can be changed depending on how the question/statement was. For example, which one do you think will sell better? 90% fat-free VS 10% fat?6. When judging likelihood we over value what 'Feels' right and undervalue statistics. 7. We hate the idea of 'wasting ' what we have already put in."
717,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31999040-shea-levy,0,"Overall I really enjoyed this book. Kahneman is an engaging writer and brings in a wealth of information to construct a compelling narrative. I'd been aware of a lot of this literature and the overall framework beforehand, but I still learned a lot in terms of specifics and got a much better sense of the details of the system 1/system 2 model and how broadly applicable it is. If you want a glimpse of what kind of understanding psychology can offer of how we reason and evaluate, I definitely recommend this one.I had some minor nits throughout and disagreed with a few of his interpretations, but the significant detractor was the framing Kahneman chose for the book. He made some choices seemingly to promote his goal of influencing water cooler conversation (which by itself seemed strange to me) that I think weakened chances for understanding. The biggest one was the discussion of the separate categories of thought processes as separate systems with their own agency and personalities. Kahneman acknowledges this as a fiction explicitly, but that didn't seem to mitigate the confusion that I think might result. I do think there's a true and useful categorization underneath the system 1/system 2 distinction, but treating them as completely distinct and partially at odds obfuscates the deeply intertwined and inseparable nature of the processes. One particular recurrent issue that resulted from this was identifying system 2 with the self and then concluding (at several different points) things along the lines of ""you don't really know/decide/etc. most things, that's sneaky old System 1"". And ascribing judgmental personality traits to the systems (e.g. ""system 2 is lazy"" instead of ""effortful thinking is costly"") may help the reader from an intuitive impression of them, but with a strong bias toward oversimplification and negative evaluation.More minorly, Kahneman also usually leaves out details like how strong the effects noted are, what proportion of the subjects were affected, etc. seemingly out of a desire to craft a coherent picture that applies wholly to the reader. One of the times where he does include some of this information this gets particularly ridiculous: In one paragraph on page 171 he mentions that ""only four of the fifteen participants [in the ""helping experiment""] responded immediately to the appeal for help,"" and in the next says ""even normal, decent people do not rush to help when they expect others to take on the unpleasantness of dealing with a seizure. And that means you, too."". 4/15 is pretty bad given the issue at hand, but if that generalizes it emphatically doesn't mean ""you"" for more than 1 in 4 of the readers! Many of the errors he mentioned I could easily identify in myself, some of them I have evidence for thinking they don't apply as strongly as he claims (e.g. actually having been in a few diffusion of responsibility type scenarios and taking action), and for the rest I simply have no way to judge likelihood without diving into the references. I think adding in these details would have gone a long way to forming a more accurate understanding in the reader, but I have an uncharitable suspicion that it would also have significantly weakened some of the cases he was making.All that being said, I really did enjoy this book and by the end couldn't put it down. Kahneman clearly knows his stuff and I'm much better informed having read it. I've already taken steps to try to incorporate some of the lessons into my thinking and decision making, and definitely plan to seek out more in this domain."
718,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"I am familiar with Daniel Kahneman's work through many of his essays and articles in various magazines in the past. I had always found them thought-provoking, interesting and challenging established notions. That is why I was excited to read this book on Behavioral psychology by him. However, this book lived up to my expectations only partially. One reason is that the author's contention that 'our intuitive preferences are more influential than rational choice' gets well established fairly early in the book through the many experiments that he describes. Consequently, I felt a sense of repetition in the latter half of the book and gradually felt that the book lost steam completely towards the closing sections.To put it simply, the book says that there are two systems which drive the way we think and make choices. The author calls them System 1 and System 2. System 1 is intuitive, quick and influenced by emotion. System 2 is slower, rational, logical and reflective. The author's research says that System 1 is more influential than what our experience tells us and it is the subliminal determinant of the many choices and judgments that we make. This is contrary to our general belief that we are very rational in our decision-making. The many example experiments that the book outlines show us that we must really be a lot more watchful in the assurance with which we trust our decisions as rooted in rationality. To me, this is the biggest lesson from the book.A few other points of interest from the book are:1. Luck plays a large role in every story of success. The author illustrates it with the telling contemporary example of the founders of Google willing to sell their company for less than $1 million but the buyer thought that the price was too high!2. High intelligence does not make people immune to biases3. Rationality should be distinguished from intelligence.4. While talking about the consequences of Priming, the author points to a conclusion that may be an indictment of capitalist society. He says that living in a culture that surrounds us with constant reminders of money may shape our behavior and attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.5. On the subject of Intuition vs Formulas, the author quotes a memorable formula of researcher Robyn Dawes:Marital Stability = frequency of lovemaking - frequency of quarrels!6. In the final section of the book, titled 'Two Selves', the author dabbles into the question of human happiness. Two statements caught my attention.a. The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?b. There is low correlation between individuals' circumstances and their satisfaction with life. The reason is that both experienced happiness and life satisfaction are largely determined by the genetics of temperament.In this context, I wondered whether the author is aware of Friedrich Nietzsche's contention that animals are happy because they lack a capacity for past memories. Perhaps the author's term 'genetics of temperament' include a capacity to forget the past and move on with life.I found it educational and interesting in parts but somewhat disappointing overall, given my initial expectations from the author."
719,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40437278-miebara-jato,5,"In 1979, Kahneman with his longtime collaborator, Late Amos Tversky published their groundbreaking academic paper, “Prospect Theory” (which was further updated in 1992). It was a buzz in the academic world. Kahneman who later went on to receive Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 is the first psychologist to earn the prize in that category. Kahneman sequenced into a book hundreds of research papers spanning over 30 years on decision making he wrote with his intellectual friend and collaborator, Tversky. Thinking Fast and Slow is his seminal work on the topic of decision making and cognitive bias.Thinking Fast and Slow is a dense, technical but rewarding read. The book exhaustively discussed biases and fallacies people are prone to make. He talks about the halo effect, affection bias, and confirmation biases. The crux of the book is on cognitive biases, yeah.Humans are said to be “rational beings.” That we are capable of making rational and logical choices. But Kahneman argues it is not always so. “Humans beings,” he insists, “are prone to make illogical choices. We rely so much on statistics, numbers, or information. We are quick at even saying “numbers don’t lie.’ Because we think along those lines, when we are fed with information about a particular issue, we start to feel that it is true or even concludes it has a higher likelihood of reoccurrence. We also make an intuitive judgment based on the information that is available. Kahneman is warning us to be careful with such information in our swaying judgment. It is what he calls the availability syndrome. Making judgments on how likely an event will happen based on how easy it is to think of an example. Availability doesn't equate to truth, he cautioned. Coming to the mind, he wrote that we think with two systems, system 1 and system 2. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. System 2, on the other hand, is slower, analytical, deliberative, and logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. Kahneman also shows that we tend to place more value on what we currently own more than it’s real economic value. He called it the “endowment effect”. With the endowment effect, our economic decisions are made through the lens of opportunity costs. The other key concept extensively discussed in the book is “Loss Aversion” or status quo bias. That is, we work harder not to lose something than we will gain something. Losing something pains twice than the joy of winning. All-in-all, this book is a must-read for everyone. I cannot recommend it highly enough. All-in-all, this book is a must-read for everyone. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
720,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36401880-sagar-acharya,5,"This is by far the best book I've ever read. I cannot emphasize more on reading this book before all the others!Over small chapters spread over the entire book, nobel prize winner Kahneman goes on to describe initially how system 1 (subconscious) and your system 2 (conscious) work. He describes that how most of our choices in normal life are governed by subconscious because system 2 is lazy and he gave many examples around it.Reversion to the mean was a tremendous mind-opener. As also was choice making section where he describes the peak-end vs time biases where we tend to say that this guys life was successful because he reached to such a success height and his end was happy rather than integrating happiness vs time which would sort of be a better measure for success. This happens because our long term memory tends to remember the peak and end more than overall time experience because they're the strong memory points.One part which I found was wrong was Kahneman's belief in efficient market theory. It was ironic that after mentioning so many biases, he found the question of predicting the future very defined by the asset pricing. But, he more than made by the rest of the content.A JEWEL!"

Kahneman calls them System 1 (the intuitive) and System 2 (the (seemingly) rational) and goes into interesting details about how they interact. He writes about intuitive judgements and how we get them wrong; about probability and how we get it wrong; about cost/benefit analysis and how we get it wrong; about our memory of the past and how we get it wrong.The ideas are not new, but they are definitely mind-blowing if you haven't encountered them before. They are presented with great examples.

Probably in two decades.Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about two distinct modes of thinking - the ""fast"" intuitive thinking that dominates much of what we do and the slow, effort-demanding, conceptual thinking that we can bring to bear. It does this in amazing, and I suspect original, detail.Superficially, the book is about cognitive biases, various forms of error and a psychological, rather than philosophical, look at volition. More deeply, it really gives an impression of what focus means and patterns of applying it so well that I believe that for most people it will be ""the best book about"" the half dozen or so things that he or she really cares about. It so startlingly illuminates some basic facts about thinking that you'll inevitably apply it to the things that you care about and understand them better because you understand the actors better.Everyone should read this book.2016: I picked as much up from the second reading as the first.

The lessons learned here have practical application in managing people, creating public policy, teaching, negotiating, marketing, shopping, buying insurance, planning your vacation, choosing your spouse and raising your children. I intend to return to this book frequently and call upon its takeaways often. There is a wealth of new vocabulary terms that ought to be made an ordinary part of watercooler conversation.

It's kind of amazing that he's couched a book on decision making using statistics in the context of fast and slow thinking. The more into statistics you are the easier this book will be to absorb.System 1 - Fast - This might be what one refers to you nearly unconscious judgements. This will attempt to process, answer, and understand any question choice or otherwise as quickly as possible. System 2 - Slow - This requires more cognitive horse power. It must be activated on purpose. You get tired if you over use this. Then there is this concept of ""Flow""P. 41 ""Riding a motorcycle at 150 miles an hour and playing a competitive game of chess are certainly effortful. IN a state of flow, howevere, maintainig focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at ahand. The mind is a pattern maker and will make things that are not related related. This was discovered by Hume. in 1945 (p. 76). He gives the example that if you animate lights such that one is still and the other is moving, but when the still one is touched by the moving the two switch and the still one continues in the same path, then the mind will attribute cause to the moving light. The point is you know that the lights are animated and the real cause is the animator. You're mind however, will represent that light one caused light 2 to move. Fascinating.Chapter 9 drives home the point that it is uncomfortable to be stumped and need to use System 2. It more or less goes through all the cognitive biases we have just so we don't have eto use System 2.I like this end point of Chapter 16. He attempts to drive home how hard headed most humans are. Even if we know the statistical answer we will not truly integrate that into decisions made. P. 174. People who are taught surprising statistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the point of telling their friends what they have heard, but this does not mean that their world has actually changed. The chapter gives the example of how someone having a stroke does not elicit a bunch of people willing to help, because in actuality most will not get involved if they think someone else might take care of it. I like it because if you consider such biases in the discrimination issues of today, it really points out something fascinating. I'll try to think more on that when i have time. Chapter 22 is interesting in that he attempts to address the issue of expert intuition. In some ways this speaks directly to the book Blink. It would be interesting to have them face off. First, we define expert as someone who has literally seen every variation and understands it, a la master chess player. They are not intuiting. They are exercising the skill. But then then the question comes in whether they know what they don't know. Hard to say. But I do like the idea that expert is a host of skills that are complementary together. p.241 - ""Expertise is not a single skill; it is a collection of skills, and the same professional may be highly expert in some of the tasks in her domain while remaining a novice in others."" The next few chapters speak to risk and the biases of optimism and the like. Very cool stuff. (Emotional, cognitive, and social factors that bias risk).The ultimate conclusion is that we should attempt to fight errors of System 1. How...P. 417 - ""recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2.""I also wonder if women and minorities are socialized in the work place to be better at this. Not the point of this guy's book though, but fascinating nonetheless.Point of view is everything in this book. He goes through more detail about each of the biases illustrated in the field of decision making. It's a worthwhile read. Context is everything. In this book, the idea of regression is that it is correct, but misinterpretted (a flawed understanding of regression to the mean). I speak specifically about Appendix A, p. 424. He's right. Inference is often a problem. But I typically use the same think to describe the idea that the data is misunderstood, so inference is always wrong. Also, I likely am more intrigued by the idea that average isn't a real thing. I think Kanneman is game on this, but it's outside the scope of the book.Learned a lot, not the least of which, is how to present quite technical stats in a way that might make you read about it. "

Also: when it comes to many luck-based scenarios, the ""experts"" are often only slightly more efficient at guessing than the average layperson.It definitely left some interesting food for thought."

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

We got to together and talked about two chapters for a half an hour at lunch. With holidays this ended up taking 5 months, about the longest I can remember reading a specific book. It was a pretty awesome experience though I wish I retained more of the text and the discussion.This is a big, dense, brilliant book. But it does not build over time. It does not reference itself. It repeats questions and concepts and anecdotes but typically doesn't mention the previous instance of the topic. So by the end you are kind of on your own for a framework of holding it together.The conclusion is there with its framing device - experience versus remembering, humans versus econs, system 1 versus system 2. And the papers are there, which are really the entire book in in microcosm. But its still not enough.As a reference, this book probably does work - the chapters are short and well named. And it would probably work as a textbook, with the output being tests or papers. But leaving the reader educated could have been done better.But still the take-aways that I did retain were pretty interesting and almost certainly useful.So flawed but impressive. 4.5 of 5."
743,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27510691-ray,4,"Having heard about this book for several years I was quite excited to finally start it. However, found myself quickly bored. Not to say that the book is bad or uninteresting but rather the majority of the concepts in the book are things I've learned in business/psychology classes. That being said, this book is a nice tidy summary of a lot of these ideas (how bias work, how humans are bad at stats, how our thinking can be influenced).I did go ahead and read the whole book in search of the nuggets of new info and here are some of the things I found and really liked:* Willpower is like a muscle that you build up. When you're mentally tired it's much easier to give in. And people who are cognitively busy are more likely to make selfish choices.* Money primes individualism* Being exposed to phrases/names a lot leads us to believe them* The font size/color influence how much we believe text* It's hard for us to accept that a lot of life is random (as opposed to skill)* Regression to the mean - a really powerful concept of how people who do above their average will likely regress to their average next time around. People who are below their average will likely do better next time around.* Narrative fallacy - We love stories and tend to believe them as we draw causal inferences* People will pay a premium to transfer risk to the rich (insurance policies)It should be noted, that this whole book was about the author's experiments and not all of them have successfully been reproduced. The Undoing Project is a book I have yet to read that rebutts a lot of the ideas put forth in this book."
744,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5154953-lisa-taylor,4,"This was a really interesting book. Thinking Fast and Slow is the culmination of years of Daniel Kahneman’s research into the nature of human decision making, how our minds process the world around us, and basically how people think. From the very start the reader must realize how difficult of a subject this is to explore and understand, let alone explain. Simply by being human, any researcher working on this has to keep in mind that he is prey to the very biases he is working to uncover.This book was organized and written very well. Kahneman divides the human mind into two systems from the very beginning, giving these systems traits and tendencies to help us relate to them in ourselves. System 1 is the fast and intuitive thinking, or (if I may generalize here) our subconscious thoughts; our automatic reactions, feelings and impressions. System 2 is our rational system; the one that is often more accurate, but takes up much more energy to use. Most of us can see those two “systems” within ourselves, and that makes the book easy to follow. He often brings up points that seem arbitrary only to have them neatly tied together to create a larger concept a chapter or two later.I feel like this book was created for those who tend to be of a less scientific mind. He uses examples of experiments very often in the book that seem on the surface to prove his point, but I often wondered about the details of the experiments, which were never included. Now don’t get me wrong; I know nothing about Kahneman’s career and have no reason to think he does not do his research as scientifically as possible; that information just isn’t included in the book. This is an overall explanation of what his research has led him to conclude; if you’re looking for details and numbers and results so you can reach your own conclusion, you won’t find it here. For example:He wrote about an experiment where subjects heard various groups of words, then had to walk down a hallway to another room to do the second part of the experiment. The actual experiment was how long it took them to walk down the hall. Some people were given words that related to older people, disabilities, and generally being slow while other people were given words that related to young people, fitness, and generally being fast. People who were given the “slow words” took a significantly longer amount of time to walk the distance of the hall than those given the “fast words.” That’s really all he tells the reader because that is all he needs to make his point. And reading that, it is very easy to jump to the conclusion “wow, just hearing words can change our actions” because it’s interesting. He doesn’t answer questions like: Could the words have evoked different themes in different people’s minds? Was a background of the subjects taken to determine their general mood? Were the fast words speeding people up or the slow words slowing people down? How do you know this doesn’t only work with certain themes? Etc.My point is, take Thinking Fast and Slow with a grain of salt. The book is fun to read in the way that personality tests are fun; it’s always neat to learn more about ourselves, and it fulfills that somewhat narcissistic need in the reader. But that’s system 1 thinking; if you go into this wanting proof, you won’t get it. This is a subject very difficult to study objectively, and while I’m sure he did the job as well as possible, you can’t know that by reading his book because he does not give details, he gives his conclusions. And who can blame him? You don’t sell a book by filling it with numbers, you sell it by making it easy to understand – and when you get into such cutting edge research, there just isn’t a way to make it widely accessible and include all the nitty gritty details.I do believe this book is a very important stepping stone. Kahneman’s research is just one step toward understanding the human mind. I think many of the experiments he talks about are not enough to draw conclusions, although he does the best that he can. Scientists will continue the same path of research he has taken for centuries to come, and his ideas will be expanded on, accepted or thrown out as we learn more. This isn’t absolute truth. But if you are interested in where we stand on understanding the human mind and what theories are out there, then this book will be invaluable to you.I do not in any way think reading it is a waste of time since the ideas will most certainly change. Throughout the book he points out many of the common illusions that people fall prey to because of certain biases in our minds, and even if he doesn’t have the processes behind them exactly right (who can really know if he does or not?), that doesn’t mean the illusions aren’t real. Everyone can benefit from reading this book simply by being made aware of these pitfalls and therefore being able to avoid them in the future.So, what do I think? He went a little light on the explanations, and I wish he had provided more of the scientific details about his work. However, I understand that the book is already lengthy and so he may not have had much choice. I do absolutely recommend this book for any non-fiction readers interested in psychology or in improving their own thought processes."
745,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54320432-ieva-gr,3," Why I started reading it: This is one those books that you can see on the shelves of youtubers, in the posts of bookstagramers and the ‘to read’ lists of most your friends.What I liked about it: The idea of explaining in rather scientific terms why we are not as rational as we think. And the little games and examples that helped to see for myself that the biases and ‘brain tricks’ the authors are talking about are true. What I disliked about it: The length of it. I was listening to the audiobook and, honestly, after around 15 hours I stopped paying much attention and allowed it to play in the background. The repetitiveness. I felt like the authors had few major points and they just kept on going at them in various different ways. The fact that I didn’t get much out of it. I just finished listening to it and already don’t remember much. "
746,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90686289-venera-arakelyan,5,"To summarize:1. Our brain has 2 systems: fast intuitive and slow analytical. 2. Our brain wants to take the path of least resistance, which called Cognitive Ease.3. When faced with a difficult question, we answer a cognitively easier one. As a marketer we need to remember about this while runing surveys. 4. 'What you see is all there is' . From marketers perspective this is to justify things like branding or awareness campaigns.5. Our opinion can be changed depending on how the question/statement was. For example, which one do you think will sell better? 90% fat-free VS 10% fat?6. When judging likelihood we over value what 'Feels' right and undervalue statistics. 7. We hate the idea of 'wasting ' what we have already put in."
747,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31999040-shea-levy,0,"Overall I really enjoyed this book. Kahneman is an engaging writer and brings in a wealth of information to construct a compelling narrative. I'd been aware of a lot of this literature and the overall framework beforehand, but I still learned a lot in terms of specifics and got a much better sense of the details of the system 1/system 2 model and how broadly applicable it is. If you want a glimpse of what kind of understanding psychology can offer of how we reason and evaluate, I definitely recommend this one.I had some minor nits throughout and disagreed with a few of his interpretations, but the significant detractor was the framing Kahneman chose for the book. He made some choices seemingly to promote his goal of influencing water cooler conversation (which by itself seemed strange to me) that I think weakened chances for understanding. The biggest one was the discussion of the separate categories of thought processes as separate systems with their own agency and personalities. Kahneman acknowledges this as a fiction explicitly, but that didn't seem to mitigate the confusion that I think might result. I do think there's a true and useful categorization underneath the system 1/system 2 distinction, but treating them as completely distinct and partially at odds obfuscates the deeply intertwined and inseparable nature of the processes. One particular recurrent issue that resulted from this was identifying system 2 with the self and then concluding (at several different points) things along the lines of ""you don't really know/decide/etc. most things, that's sneaky old System 1"". And ascribing judgmental personality traits to the systems (e.g. ""system 2 is lazy"" instead of ""effortful thinking is costly"") may help the reader from an intuitive impression of them, but with a strong bias toward oversimplification and negative evaluation.More minorly, Kahneman also usually leaves out details like how strong the effects noted are, what proportion of the subjects were affected, etc. seemingly out of a desire to craft a coherent picture that applies wholly to the reader. One of the times where he does include some of this information this gets particularly ridiculous: In one paragraph on page 171 he mentions that ""only four of the fifteen participants [in the ""helping experiment""] responded immediately to the appeal for help,"" and in the next says ""even normal, decent people do not rush to help when they expect others to take on the unpleasantness of dealing with a seizure. And that means you, too."". 4/15 is pretty bad given the issue at hand, but if that generalizes it emphatically doesn't mean ""you"" for more than 1 in 4 of the readers! Many of the errors he mentioned I could easily identify in myself, some of them I have evidence for thinking they don't apply as strongly as he claims (e.g. actually having been in a few diffusion of responsibility type scenarios and taking action), and for the rest I simply have no way to judge likelihood without diving into the references. I think adding in these details would have gone a long way to forming a more accurate understanding in the reader, but I have an uncharitable suspicion that it would also have significantly weakened some of the cases he was making.All that being said, I really did enjoy this book and by the end couldn't put it down. Kahneman clearly knows his stuff and I'm much better informed having read it. I've already taken steps to try to incorporate some of the lessons into my thinking and decision making, and definitely plan to seek out more in this domain."
748,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"I am familiar with Daniel Kahneman's work through many of his essays and articles in various magazines in the past. I had always found them thought-provoking, interesting and challenging established notions. That is why I was excited to read this book on Behavioral psychology by him. However, this book lived up to my expectations only partially. One reason is that the author's contention that 'our intuitive preferences are more influential than rational choice' gets well established fairly early in the book through the many experiments that he describes. Consequently, I felt a sense of repetition in the latter half of the book and gradually felt that the book lost steam completely towards the closing sections.To put it simply, the book says that there are two systems which drive the way we think and make choices. The author calls them System 1 and System 2. System 1 is intuitive, quick and influenced by emotion. System 2 is slower, rational, logical and reflective. The author's research says that System 1 is more influential than what our experience tells us and it is the subliminal determinant of the many choices and judgments that we make. This is contrary to our general belief that we are very rational in our decision-making. The many example experiments that the book outlines show us that we must really be a lot more watchful in the assurance with which we trust our decisions as rooted in rationality. To me, this is the biggest lesson from the book.A few other points of interest from the book are:1. Luck plays a large role in every story of success. The author illustrates it with the telling contemporary example of the founders of Google willing to sell their company for less than $1 million but the buyer thought that the price was too high!2. High intelligence does not make people immune to biases3. Rationality should be distinguished from intelligence.4. While talking about the consequences of Priming, the author points to a conclusion that may be an indictment of capitalist society. He says that living in a culture that surrounds us with constant reminders of money may shape our behavior and attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.5. On the subject of Intuition vs Formulas, the author quotes a memorable formula of researcher Robyn Dawes:Marital Stability = frequency of lovemaking - frequency of quarrels!6. In the final section of the book, titled 'Two Selves', the author dabbles into the question of human happiness. Two statements caught my attention.a. The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?b. There is low correlation between individuals' circumstances and their satisfaction with life. The reason is that both experienced happiness and life satisfaction are largely determined by the genetics of temperament.In this context, I wondered whether the author is aware of Friedrich Nietzsche's contention that animals are happy because they lack a capacity for past memories. Perhaps the author's term 'genetics of temperament' include a capacity to forget the past and move on with life.I found it educational and interesting in parts but somewhat disappointing overall, given my initial expectations from the author."
749,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40437278-miebara-jato,5,"In 1979, Kahneman with his longtime collaborator, Late Amos Tversky published their groundbreaking academic paper, “Prospect Theory” (which was further updated in 1992). It was a buzz in the academic world. Kahneman who later went on to receive Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 is the first psychologist to earn the prize in that category. Kahneman sequenced into a book hundreds of research papers spanning over 30 years on decision making he wrote with his intellectual friend and collaborator, Tversky. Thinking Fast and Slow is his seminal work on the topic of decision making and cognitive bias.Thinking Fast and Slow is a dense, technical but rewarding read. The book exhaustively discussed biases and fallacies people are prone to make. He talks about the halo effect, affection bias, and confirmation biases. The crux of the book is on cognitive biases, yeah.Humans are said to be “rational beings.” That we are capable of making rational and logical choices. But Kahneman argues it is not always so. “Humans beings,” he insists, “are prone to make illogical choices. We rely so much on statistics, numbers, or information. We are quick at even saying “numbers don’t lie.’ Because we think along those lines, when we are fed with information about a particular issue, we start to feel that it is true or even concludes it has a higher likelihood of reoccurrence. We also make an intuitive judgment based on the information that is available. Kahneman is warning us to be careful with such information in our swaying judgment. It is what he calls the availability syndrome. Making judgments on how likely an event will happen based on how easy it is to think of an example. Availability doesn't equate to truth, he cautioned. Coming to the mind, he wrote that we think with two systems, system 1 and system 2. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. System 2, on the other hand, is slower, analytical, deliberative, and logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. Kahneman also shows that we tend to place more value on what we currently own more than it’s real economic value. He called it the “endowment effect”. With the endowment effect, our economic decisions are made through the lens of opportunity costs. The other key concept extensively discussed in the book is “Loss Aversion” or status quo bias. That is, we work harder not to lose something than we will gain something. Losing something pains twice than the joy of winning. All-in-all, this book is a must-read for everyone. I cannot recommend it highly enough. All-in-all, this book is a must-read for everyone. I cannot recommend it highly enough."

I had put this in my every year to-read-list for 3 consecutive years and the hope of finishing it had been thin. This time last year I picked up Leonardo da Vinci and it dragged on for 6 months. I learned a valuable lesson from then on, that’s it’s okay to have an affair with books. While reading this book, I've swept through a whole YA Fantasy series and even started another book. What kept me afloat was a simple rule, I only had to read this book 1 hour every day, then I could be off to read whatever I want. There were days my will power was too low that I might give myself a break by immersing on a romance novel and come back fresher the next day.   2 months came by like a rush, and now I feel sorry this book ended so soon.    Why do we need to read this book when we can read a summary version of it online and eagerly tell anyone who asks that this book was a-okay? Because you read to understand. Only when you can summarise this book from your own understanding of it can you know that it will stick with you and be of help in your life for a long time. Please do not read this if you have no interest in human behaviors, you do not really care why we do what we do, or how we make mistakes, how we come up with decisions. That time can be well spent doing many things else but reading Thinking, Fast and SlowHowever if you need to understand this fast for work or any project, you can read 2 of the authors’ researches that built up this book, then start reading the book when you feel up for the commitment.And now the question is, when will I finish Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder?

751,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"My favorite passage: ""When I asked my large undergraduate class in some indignation, 'Do you realize that you have violated an elementary logical rule?' someone in the back row shouted, 'So what?'"" (p.158).Most relevant for me were the many examples of the striking differences in between subjects and within subjects experiments. So, for example, when subjects were asked to judge the value of the following sets of dinnerware presented together, they judged set A as more valuable:SET A: 40 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good condition8 cups, 2 of them broken8 saucers, 7 of them brokenSET B: 24 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good conditionBut when subjects saw only one or the other of the two sets, they judged SET B to be worth more than SET A. Why? When presented with the sets together, they could make a comparative judgment and see that SET A contained more items in good shape than set B. But seen individually, they make a snap judgment of average value of the items in the set, which is higher in SET B than in SET A. I couldn't help but think about the relevance of this idea when you're putting your CV together. Say there are two candidates for a job. Candidate A has two publications in really good journals. Candidate B has two publications in equally good journals, and also two publications in unrefereed conference proceedings or journals edited by her friends. Considered side by side, maybe Candidate B has a slight advantage over A, but considered individually, Candidate A looks better. The average level of her publications is higher than B's. Maybe I should prune my list of conference presentations in light of this finding.Kahneman says (p.354) that ""We normally experience life in the between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent..."" and that in making decisions we should encourage consideration of ""broad context"", which includes alternatives (p.361). This is clearly relevant to debates about contextualism and invariantism, conversational context, and the standard linguistic methodology of eliciting intuitions from subjects about individual cases isolated from contrasting cases.

Maybe it's my problem. Maybe I just think differently. I suspect this book is written for left brained thinkers. I am very much a right brained thinker. Consequently, the author would pose a problem, assume the reader came to a certain conclusion, then built his thesis on the conclusion he assumes the reader arrived at. The problem was I never I arrived at his preconceived conclusions. Maybe because he assumes our brains all work a certain way. Ironic at that.Here's some examples. He gives a problem and tells us not to try to solve it but listen to our intuition:A ball and a bat cost $1.10The bat cost one dollar more than the bat.How much does the ball cost?Then he goes on to explain that the number that came to our mind was 10 cents because the ""distinctive mark of an easy puzzle is intuitive, appealing and wrong."" Then he informs us that the actual cost of the ball is 5 cents.But that is not how I read the problem. And since I didn't know where he was going with the puzzle, I assumed he was testing our ability to catch logical fallacies.When the statement said a ball and a bat cost $1.10, I assumed that he meant they EACH cost $1.10. After all he did not say the sum of the cost or that ""together"" they cost. I then went on to conclude the next two sentences were wrong.So does that make me stupid?Here's another one: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?According to the author the answer is determined whether the reader will remember that Detroit is in Michigan.OK. But the question was not whether Michigan has a high rate of murders, or higher than other states. The question was what number of murders occur in Michigan. Isn't that what ""how many murders"" means?My answer was, how the heck do I know the number of murders that occur anywhere without consulting a reliable census source?Needless to say I found this book frustrating and not a very reliable source for learning about cognitive functions."
753,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,5,"Finishing this book means I completed my 2017 Reading Challenge here on Goodreads. It also means I finished a book that I bought in 2015 ""because it was a book one ought to read"". I couldn't voluntarily take it off the shelf to read. What got me to read and finish and enjoy this book was reading it with some colleagues at work. The issue came up during a training class - I actually do not remember how - and several of us decided that we would read a section of the book every two weeks. There were five sections so we would finish in approximately 10 weeks. This way, there was room for busy events at work that could keep us from reading or the events of our own lives. The period of two weeks wasn't too long so that fast readers would get impatient or bored, or that anyone would forget anything. We met for only 30 minutes - either during lunch or a short time after where we each stated one thing we liked and one thing we disliked, after which we could have a free discussion. Stating one thing we liked or disliked was merely a device for ensuring all could be heard and to try to structure our thoughts in the short time frame.It worked. But I am not finished with the book. Oh yes, I read the book. However, this is not a quick read that you put back on the shelf and ignore. There are some heavy-duty thoughts in here that I, for one, will need to lean on for a long time when referencing points during a discussion. Also, some parts were a little over my head - I haven't studied probability so I lacked the vocabulary to grasp those areas well. However, to Kahneman's praise, his writing meant that I could plow through those bits and still get his point.I have already been recommending this book to others. While carrying it around at work for our meetings, some people I knew would say ""oh, excellent book"", so it almost became a secret handshake. :)All in all, I had a good experience reading and digesting this book. :)"
754,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"If you want to read a layman's introduction into the psychology of decision making, Kahneman's book is probably the best. Dan Ariely has written similar books, but his are kind of jokey, lightweight, and unnuanced. Thinking, Fast and Slow is unlike most bestsellers in that it assumes the reader is intelligent and isn't on the beach or skimming. It's not particularly engaging - Kahneman's writing is on the dry and pedantic side - but this book is carefully written, and packed with fifty years of work in the field of decision making. While of course Kahneman tends to focus on his own research, he is very generous in citing and lauding the work of others. In a lot of ways, this book is a very impressive achievement.Unlike Ariely, Kahneman doesn't emphasize the follies in the way our brain works. Rather he very simply, plainly, and convincingly shows how we as humans tend to go from point A to point B in our thinking. The examples he uses are very easy to grasp if you are a careful reader. I'd say, using the parlance of Kahneman, that if you have a well developed System 2 - patience and a love of slow thinking - and an interest in how humans think you'll enjoy this book. It's probably also true that the kind of person who'll find Thinking, Fast and Slow interesting will consistently find that he or she is in the minority population in the examples cited. At least that's what I found. If Kahneman says something like 84 percent will say A and 16 percent will say B in response to a question, I'll be in the 16 percent. Finding myself consistently in the minority was an illuminating thing, actually. I've always ascribed my tendency for oddball thinking to my strange background of growing up around war survivors and Hassidic Jews. Nope. Now I realize that I'm just a System 2 kind of guy."
755,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"4Thinking, Fast and Slow for the better part is a solid and interesting read. My central complaint is the repetitive later sections of the book. Apart from that this is a must-read book for everybody. Understanding the way you think is worth the early chapters, and it's quite a simplistic design for consumption. It does get heavy in the latter half of the book, and to be honest I was quite bored here myself. But, make no mistake, Daniel Kahneman has created something unique and informative. The structure of the book was interesting, with the common stage 1 & 2 mapped throughout. I will say this, you won't finish the book and not understand these two meanings. There feels like a repeat of information here, but there is a lot to digest. I quite liked the idea of the book and I think structurally it's okay. Some of the information should've been condensed at times, but more might be something the majority of readers wanted. I enjoy reading books like this to understand the why. This book explains so much and that's why I continued to read and finish it. Why the 4?I can understand why certain reviews have marked it tedious. I get that. I did found it tough to read in that final 100 pages, but I was more engaged with finishing and information overload. This is a good book. The author has thrown in so much, so in hindsight I would recommend slowly digesting if you're allowed. That comment is more to the owner of the book, the library reader has to make the call based on the amount of people in the waiting list. I discovered a lot here, and as creatures of habit, you will notice these examples day after day. You can't unread what you've learned. I recommend reading this and not force reading it like I did. It's a book to slow down and read from time to time. "

I would just like to be able to memorize it all.The insight of making us understand how the human mind works and why we make some choices, is just brilliant.The only regret I have is that even if you read and understand things， the way our brain is wired， its software， can not be easily changed. This means that even if you are aware of things， it does not mean you are not susceptible for falling into traps. I cannot copy here the entire book content， but I will give an example:<“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion”. Moses took no animals into the ark;Noah did. The Moses illusion is explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context， and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him， but the mention of his name is not surprising. It also helps that Moses and Noah have the same vowel sound and number of syllables， so you unconsciously detect associative coherence between “Moses” and “ark” and so quickly accept the question. Replace Moses with George W Bush in this sentence and you will have a poor political joke but no illusion.>"
757,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16459651-allie,1,"This book was repetitive and tedious. I had to read it for a course, and I would definitely not have bothered otherwise. Within the first part of this book you've experienced all there is to experience. Kahneman goes through this book repeating the same theories in different ways again and again. Every now and then there will be a brief interlude of him bragging about his Nobel Prize or some other research he did that doesn't fully apply. This book got off to quite a bad start with me as it is 100% directed at Americans. I felt like many of the examples just confused the points more as they were based on knowledge that I, as an Australian, do not have just generally. He also frequently gives an example of an effect and then says ""You thought this"". A majority of the time though I did not think what he claimed, making me frustrated at the writing and the theory he then presented. I feel like this book was very much a cocky piece of writing in which the author frequently claimed that as a population we're pretty stupid. I can understand this was not his intention, but it came across that way. If you do want to read this book, I suggest a brief skimming of the conclusions section in the back. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. "
758,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7541671-ariadna73,5,Here is my comment in Spanish: http://bit.ly/XhWvoUDaniel Kahneman is a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. Curiously; he only devotes one chapter of this book to his field of expertise (but it is a heck of a chapter; I tell ya) He explains how our brains think in two ways: slow and fast. Our fast brain help us make quick decisions so we don't get ran over by cars or hit by balls; or stand up for days on the supermarket isles deciding which product to buy. The second system thinks more slowly and that is the one that help us make the most important decisions in our lives like to whom we will get married and for whom we should work. Well; those two systems trend to interact and screw up each other; so this is why the world is so screwed up. The book is pretty scientific; and dense. I understood probably a third of it; but I liked chap. 1 and the conclussions; and I honestly tried the statistics one (chap 3;4) and the economics ones (5); but as I said it was difficult. I think this book would be very good as an object of study in specialized classes. I really liked it. I gave it 9 weeks of my time. It is really good.
759,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16430203-swaroop,4,"This is a great book to read for anyone with a passing interest in behavioral economics. It's significantly more detailed and scientific than other pop-science books in the genre by Malcolm Gladwell et al.You can break up the book into 3 parts.In the first part, he dismantles the rational choice theory. Kahneman says he is not out to dismantle classical economic theory, according to him, he is not questioning the rational agent theory, he is just establishing that humans are not rational agents. (Cool story bro.)He then proceeds to dismantle another popular assumption, that humans always try to maximize utility. The third part of the book, about the 'science of happiness' was easily the least interesting part of the book. Coincidentally, this part of the book comprises mostly of work done after Tversky's death. My biggest problem with this book and many other books of this genre is the constant repetition. Frankly, this book is much better than others in this respect. That only speaks to how absurd other books are.This was a fantastic read but I think I am done with books like this for a while."

I had put this book down when I was younger and determined to take up this challenge for myself, I decided to read 50 pages per day years later. And I completed it within a month! Undoubtedly, my most difficult and yet enriching, it almost felt like attending economics classes and feeling doubly intelligent while reading this one. Daniel Kahneman is a Genius...He talks about how our mind processes things, how judgements happen and why we jump to conclusions, why we always chose the easy way to do things, risk luck and intuition and many more theories. ..Don’t buy this one if you’re looking for an easy-breezy read, but if you’re willing to dive into making your brain take the harder way into understanding these concepts, on Economics and Behavioural Psychology with interesting case studies, don’t miss this one written by a Nobel Laureate ⭐️"

I had initially dismissed this book without reading it, thinking it would be about business/economics (I’d blame it on the blurb found on the cover, something from the author of Freakonomics). I read it because I found out it’s a pretty famous book on Goodreads.com I enjoyed parts of the book; I’d say 3/5th of it. I had skimmed through mostly the rest of it as it was too technical. The book is a very deep and technical study (as far as I’m concerned) on behavioural sciences and economics. But whatever I did read, it was excellent. The use of examples and sample question scenarios helped in understanding how the brain works and how & why we think the way we think. It is not a light read; it required me to sit up and actively understand it. Not really my type of a book, and I probably wouldn’t want to read anything similar. "

Although I appreciate the detail in which the author goes into, at times it was a bit much for me, which made it a sluggish read at times.I did like how Kahneman, to demonstrate concepts, asks you questions or has you look at pictures, and then explains what was occurring in your mind during that exercise.

Drawing on knowledge acquired from years of research in cognitive and social psychology, Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Daniel Kahneman delivers his magnum opus on Behavioral Economics. This excellent book focuses on the three key sets of distinctions: between the automatic System 1 and the effortful System 2, between the conception of agents in classical economics and in behavioral economics, and between the experiencing and the remembering selves. This enlightening 512-page book is composed of thirty-eight chapters and broken out by the following five Parts: Part I. Two Systems, Part II. Heuristics and Biases, Part III. Overconfidence, Part IV. Choices, and Part V. Two Selves.Positives:1.	Award-winning research. A masterpiece of behavioral economics knowledge. Overall accessible.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of a master. How the mind works. The biases of intuition, judgment, and decision making. 3.	Excellent format. Each chapter is well laid out and ends with a Speaking of section that summarizes the content via quotes.4.	A great job of defining and summarizing new terms. ""In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."" 5.	Supports findings with countless research. Provides many accessible and practical examples that help readers understand the insightful conclusions.6.	A great job of letting us what we know and to what degree. ""It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work.""7.	You are guaranteed to learn something. Countless tidbits of knowledge throughout this insightful book and how it applies to the read world. ""The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.""8.	The differences of Systems 1 and 2 and how they function with one another. ""System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."" ""System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.""9.	Important recurring concepts like WYSIATI (What You See Is All There IS). ""You surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle.""10.	Understanding heuristics and biases. ""The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.""11.	Paradoxical results for your enjoyment. ""People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it.""12.	Understanding how our brains work, ""The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.""13.	Wisdom. ""'Risk' does not exist 'out there,' independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as 'real risk' or 'objective risk.'"" Bonus. ""To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.""14.	You will learn lessons that are practical. ""Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.""15.	An interesting look at overconfidence. ""Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."" ""Remember this rule: intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.""16.	Have you ever had to plan anything in your life? Meet the planning fallacy. ""This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an “outside view” and is the cure to the planning fallacy.""17.	A very interesting look at Econs and Humans. ""Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices.""18.	 Prospect theory explained. ""The pain of losing $900 is more than 90% of the pain of losing $1,000. These two insights are the essence of prospect theory.""19.	Avoiding poor psychology. ""The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.""20.	Great stuff on well being. 21.	An excellent Conclusions chapter that ties the book up comprehensively.Negatives:1.	Notes not linked up.2.	No formal separate bibliography.3.	Requires an investment of time. Thankfully, the book is worthy of your time.4.	The book overall is very well-written and accessible but some topics are challenging. 5.	Wanted more clarification on how Bayes's rules work.In summary, a masterpiece on behavioral economics. Dr. Kahneman shares his years of research and provides readers with an education on how the mind works. It requires an investment of your time but it so well worth it.

Overall, I think the book is a decent introduction for someone who is interested in why we make the choices we do, who doesn't already have a grasp of the theories or recently published studies in psychology and economics. That said, if you do, I don't think you'd find this book as interesting or helpful in extending your knowledge. Though by no means an expert in either, I have followed both fields, particularly where they intersect and have to do with consumer decision-making, and subsequently felt the book dragged on in parts and at times, even felt a little dated.Overall, a very solid 4* read.

""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is an amazing book, but it's not a casual read. That being said, I think it's one of the most important books of our time.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is a book about how we, as humans, make decisions. The author, Daniel Kahneman is an Economist and Nobel Laureate who has spent a lifetime (he's 82 years old) studying why we make stupid decisions. Alright, that's actually a bit simplistic. He and his partner, Amos Tversky, spent their entire careers studying how we decide things.In this book, Kahneman asks us to imagine that our minds are actually two distinct beings - beings that he (and other economists and psychologists) refer to as 'System 1' and 'System 2'. ""... I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make."" - Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 13). I would describe the 'two agents' as follows: System 1 is intuitive, emotional, artistic, imaginative, creative, spontaneous, forgetful, vain, superstitious, illogical, and capricious. System 2 is logical, deliberative, suspicious, wary, calculating, practical, attentive, just, predictable, and (unfortunately) indolent.Now, when you think about it, this internal dynamic is not really a new discovery. The innate dichotomy of the human mind has been a source of introspection, conversation, speculation, and proselytization for thousands of years. What makes this book different than the rest, though, is the lack of condemnation of either of the Systems of thought. Instead of venerating one and vilifying the other, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" focuses on the dynamic between the two systems of thought and shows how, if we understand and accept ourselves fully, we can make full use of the best aspects of our two selves and avoid the less desirable aspects.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is full to the brim with statistics and survey results and laborious studies and quotes from esoteric scientific papers. As such, I found it a very challenging read. Nonetheless, in spite of the difficult subject matter, Kahneman is able to keep it real. Real world anecdotes and easy to imagine thought experiments are woven into the narrative to help the lay person (like me) to more fully grok the subject matter. Additionally, each chapter sticks to one topic and ends with a summery that's designed to help the reader remember what was covered and to provide some simple ways that we can use the chapters lessons in our everyday lives. Theses summaries take the form ""Speaking of........) Here are some examples from the book:Chapter 1 - Speaking of System 1 and System 2 “He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.” “This was a pure System 1 response. She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.” “This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.”Chapter 5 -Speaking of Cognitive Ease""Let's not dismiss their business plan just because the font makes it hard to read.""""We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but let's think it through again.""""Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.""""I'm in a good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.""Chapter 36 - Speaking of Life as a Story “He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.” “The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.” “You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?” “She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”Chapter 37 - Speaking of Experienced Well-Being “The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.” “The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?” “Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.”Although the author didn't say anything in the book about spiritual growth, from my perspective, the entire book was a textbook on the subject of self mastery. I believe that it could be used in combination with specifically adapted meditation practices and lifestyle changes as primary source-book for a serious spiritual development class or group."

771,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9485245-prashant,5,"Thinking fast and slow is a book that came along in 2011 though I still feel that it’s one of the most relevant and important books of its times. Personally, for me, it’s one of those books where every time you read it, you are able to learn something new.Though there is a caveat: This is a book which will scare you the moment you will pick it, as it's a heavy book to read, though if you can fight back and finish the first 100 pages then I can assure you that the writing of Daniel Kanheman will be able to keep you intrigued in the book until you finish it. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.  Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Though we do need to talk a little about the author as well i.e. Daniel Kahneman, is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is seen by many as one of the world’s most important thinkers. So, If you are thinking, I am in sales and how would this book help in my subject then for your surprise, his research influences our daily lives in a big way, for example, he gives an example of a situation in which people who are risk-averse, becomes risky and vice versa. He helps us understand, how our minds work in perceiving a statement and how it influences our decisions. If you are feeling that I have a boring, normal job then why should I read this book- then it could help you understand when we should approach people to get a decision in our favor i.e. you should approach your boss for raise when his tummy is full and he is happy as that’s the time when people actually put their guards down and use their intuitions more than their brains.If you are a stock-broker then it gives the perfect advice to not follow your stocks on a regular basis and looking them only once a quarter to generate better returns. There are so many words of wisdom in this book that it’s difficult for me to capture all over here and I can assure you that it’s tougher to implement those in your life, ergo, I have decided to read this book every year and I feel that it’s definitely not a bad decision. The last section of the book explores the contrasting ‘selves’ embodied in every individual: the remembering self and the experiencing self. The remembering self refers to the aspect in our nature that evaluates episodes by the lasting memory they leave; the one that keeps track of goals and keeps mental accounts; that answers the question: how satisfied are you with your life? The experiencing self is the aspect that feels every moment; that evaluates pleasure and pain on the go. Interestingly, these two selves are in conflict. The remembering self overweights the end of an episode and is indifferent to duration; it often promotes actions based on the memory that will result. Paradoxically, people may prefer an experience that is more painful in aggregate sum than another simply as a result of it ending on a less painful note.Kahneman concludes that both selves are necessary for evaluating subjective wellbeing, as both give us important information. Focusing exclusively on one or the other therefore excludes an important aspect of wellbeing.This book succeeds in instilling an awareness of the many biases and heuristics that lead to errors of judgments and poor decision-making. Above all, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a highly enjoyable and informative read for anyone wanting an insight into the human mind. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."

Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."
773,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3279705-vivian-zhang,4,My goodness. I did not know our thoughts could be so contradictory!I definitely did not take the right type of notes while reading this book to best navigate how I will think in the future... would love to hear how others have internalized their lessons learned.
774,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,4,"Daniel Kahneman was one of my professor's phd advisor at Princeton, and you can tell. Before reading this book I had a chance to be part of all these tiny experiments and see on my own mind where I have a bias and where I naturally tend to use ""system 2"" for my own good. Like everyone else, I have my goods and bads too, and this book does a very good job to explain *why* one might respond in a particular way to a question, but I have no idea how to correct them besides trying hard to be careful - which contradicts the definition of a bias really, so maybe they're not fixable. Having been through many of the experiments in this book (as well as the ones in Choices, values & frames, which I plan to read as well soon), I'm now really glad that I postponed reading this by two years! (The size was initially overwhelming, but it turned out to be a very casual read)The book feels very cozy after having been through the experiments, but it's great nevertheless, regardless of this practical stuff. I do wish that more of those posting on fb 10 strong opinions on 10 different subjects / day would read it too :)Some of my favorite quotes:In 1955, as a twenty-one-year-old lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces, I was assigned to set up an interview system for the entire army. If you wonder why such a responsibility would be forced upon someone so young, bear in mind that the state of Israel itself was only seven years old at the time.Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgement is missing - what we see is all there is. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. [...] Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.""How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?"" The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the ""Moses illusion"". Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did."
775,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is a book I'm more glad I have read than I actually enjoyed reading it. My favorite passage, incidentally, came in the introduction, when the author describes his working relationship with a close collaborator and which I identified with strongly. Several other points I took away are as follows:--the difference between thinking actively and passively, and particularly, that active thinking affects behavior in other ways (making people more selfish, superficial, and sexist). I identify with this based on how people perceive me when I'm exceptionally busy.--the concept of ""what you see is all there is,"" and particularly of priming effects, and implicit influence of what's in front of you. (My boss seems especially vulnerable to this!) As well this makes me rededicate myself to the theory that you should hire people based on their resumes rather than interviews; or at the very least employ your judgment only after scoring candidates (or other things, it's relevant more broadly) on more objective metrics--a valuable construct in business, to postulate how things could go wrong, as a method to avoid groupthink, encourage creative thinking, and make sure opposing ideas are heard--the difference in risk aversion with respect to gains and losses...not taking good gambles, and preferring risky gambles to limit losses. The author points out that most people avoid this pitfall when the games are presented as one they would play multiple times, but also highlight that in life, any gamble is almost certainly one of many. However, despite this interesting research, I found this book rather dry, and I read almost exclusively non-fiction. As well, the author's many references to the influence of his work, his Nobel Prize, etc., grew old by the end. The format, of repeating the research results in several different ways, with somewhat cheesy examples at the end of each chapter, was a bit didactic for me. But I did learn a good amount. "
776,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8070622-adam-morva,5,"When I'm hungry I tend to make myself bigger servings of meals than I can comfortably eat, and I always want to buy more food and snacks in the supermarket than I need. We could call this a bias, I suppose. Some primal part of my mind gets bathed in hunger hormones and such, and it makes me do things I shouldn't be doing, and those things would make me fat, so I learned to control this hellish urge, and whenever I do the groceries hungry, I remind myself of this fact. Whenever I start a meal really hungry I pick less food than what my eyes desire, and even gulp down a glass of water in order to ease my sense of hunger a bit.Why do I tell you this?Because some reviewers have said that it's useless to read about our mental short circuits, because we can't possibly do anything about them.Wrong. We can!Identifying your biases and intellectual pitfalls is the first step to combating them.Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about much more nuanced, and much less obvious circuits of thinking, and boy, it talks about a lot of them. I fancy myself a skeptic, a scientist, a student of thinking, so I've already known about most of the topics this book touches, and while it is not a complete list of all our intellectual quirks, IT TOOK ME YEARS to learn about the ones found in the book. So dear potential reader, you are lucky, because thanks to this wonderful book, you get to learn about them in the space of a lazy weekend (499 pages).Whether you are a big time corporate fatcat, a teacher, or a soccer mom, you'll benefit greatly from keeping at least some of Kahneman's conclusions in mind, because you are human, and we humans need to learn how to think, because we tend to make all sorts of mistakes."
777,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013427-laura,4,"A groundbreaking book on the pitfalls of subconscious thought. Thinking, Fast and Slow is the product of new (at the time) research on quick, mostly subconscious, intuitive thought and deliberate, logical thought. The major insight from this book is the many, many ways that the intuition can be misled and provide one with faulty conclusions. This insight was most applicable to me as I consider my role on a book acquisition committee, as my team meets regularly to collectively decide which book proposals to accept and reject. There is immense potential for intuitive factors to weigh largely in these decisions as we make a long series of important decisions carefully but with necessary time restrictions. I strongly advise anyone in similar decision-making situations to read this book, or another book on this topic. It will give you good tools for careful thinking and for helping others avoid unwarranted conclusions. One reason you might choose not to read this book is that it is quite long and dedicates too much space to describing his research methodology. I would also have preferred more discussion of ways that a well-developed intuition can be an asset (though Kahnneman appropriately points out that awareness of intuition pitfalls can, over time, lead to better intuition). Another book I've read, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do does this well and would be a good companion or follow-up to this book."

Most of the books I give 4-star reviews to are well written and interesting, but not important per se, like Harry Potter or David McCulluogh's book on the building of the Panama Canal. No matter how good those books are, they're not exactly life changing. Thinking, Fast and Slow is well written and quite interesting, but beyond that I think it's an important book because it explains so much about how we think, why we make the choices we make, and how we can make better choices as well as help others to make better choices. As I read it I found myself thinking I need to read this about 10 times and take notes about how to apply it to my business, my family, and my other relationships. There is just so much useful stuff in the book. I could use it to change the language I use on my business website, I could use it to change how I communicate with my children, and I could use it to change how I interact with my spouse. There is so much knowledge packed into this, and I especially appreciate how, at the end of each chapter, Kahneman gives a few 1-2 sentence practical examples of how his research can be used in the real world."
779,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre,3,"I bought the audiobook for this after a reviewer of Chuck Klosterman's latest book drew a parallel with THINKING, FAST AND SLOW and OF COURSE both books have nothing to do with one another. How do I keep getting suckered into reading these books about cognitive biases and heuristics, I do not know. This one's pretty well made though and exposes a theory of two thought system: an intuitive one that takes instant decisions (like putting pants on in the morning) and hardwired to create coherence out of everything. It is this brain that scares people watching horror movies. There is also the second thought system that can very well override the first, which leads to conscious cognition. So that's cool and it's very enlightening to learn how to differentiate the two in your daily reactions.The book can't transcend its nature though as it plays it safe with its own scientific angle and ends up being just a list of situations where heuristics are involved. There are a lot of books like this available on the market albeit it is quite well done. It can get mind-numbing after a while and especially if you read the audiobook version like I did. Wanted to throw myself off a cliff after 15 or so hours."

I had put this in my every year to-read-list for 3 consecutive years and the hope of finishing it had been thin. This time last year I picked up Leonardo da Vinci and it dragged on for 6 months. I learned a valuable lesson from then on, that’s it’s okay to have an affair with books. While reading this book, I've swept through a whole YA Fantasy series and even started another book. What kept me afloat was a simple rule, I only had to read this book 1 hour every day, then I could be off to read whatever I want. There were days my will power was too low that I might give myself a break by immersing on a romance novel and come back fresher the next day.   2 months came by like a rush, and now I feel sorry this book ended so soon.    Why do we need to read this book when we can read a summary version of it online and eagerly tell anyone who asks that this book was a-okay? Because you read to understand. Only when you can summarise this book from your own understanding of it can you know that it will stick with you and be of help in your life for a long time. Please do not read this if you have no interest in human behaviors, you do not really care why we do what we do, or how we make mistakes, how we come up with decisions. That time can be well spent doing many things else but reading Thinking, Fast and SlowHowever if you need to understand this fast for work or any project, you can read 2 of the authors’ researches that built up this book, then start reading the book when you feel up for the commitment.And now the question is, when will I finish Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder? "
781,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"My favorite passage: ""When I asked my large undergraduate class in some indignation, 'Do you realize that you have violated an elementary logical rule?' someone in the back row shouted, 'So what?'"" (p.158).Most relevant for me were the many examples of the striking differences in between subjects and within subjects experiments. So, for example, when subjects were asked to judge the value of the following sets of dinnerware presented together, they judged set A as more valuable:SET A: 40 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good condition8 cups, 2 of them broken8 saucers, 7 of them brokenSET B: 24 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good conditionBut when subjects saw only one or the other of the two sets, they judged SET B to be worth more than SET A. Why? When presented with the sets together, they could make a comparative judgment and see that SET A contained more items in good shape than set B. But seen individually, they make a snap judgment of average value of the items in the set, which is higher in SET B than in SET A. I couldn't help but think about the relevance of this idea when you're putting your CV together. Say there are two candidates for a job. Candidate A has two publications in really good journals. Candidate B has two publications in equally good journals, and also two publications in unrefereed conference proceedings or journals edited by her friends. Considered side by side, maybe Candidate B has a slight advantage over A, but considered individually, Candidate A looks better. The average level of her publications is higher than B's. Maybe I should prune my list of conference presentations in light of this finding.Kahneman says (p.354) that ""We normally experience life in the between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent..."" and that in making decisions we should encourage consideration of ""broad context"", which includes alternatives (p.361). This is clearly relevant to debates about contextualism and invariantism, conversational context, and the standard linguistic methodology of eliciting intuitions from subjects about individual cases isolated from contrasting cases.

Maybe it's my problem. Maybe I just think differently. I suspect this book is written for left brained thinkers. I am very much a right brained thinker. Consequently, the author would pose a problem, assume the reader came to a certain conclusion, then built his thesis on the conclusion he assumes the reader arrived at. The problem was I never I arrived at his preconceived conclusions. Maybe because he assumes our brains all work a certain way. Ironic at that.Here's some examples. He gives a problem and tells us not to try to solve it but listen to our intuition:A ball and a bat cost $1.10The bat cost one dollar more than the bat.How much does the ball cost?Then he goes on to explain that the number that came to our mind was 10 cents because the ""distinctive mark of an easy puzzle is intuitive, appealing and wrong."" Then he informs us that the actual cost of the ball is 5 cents.But that is not how I read the problem. And since I didn't know where he was going with the puzzle, I assumed he was testing our ability to catch logical fallacies.When the statement said a ball and a bat cost $1.10, I assumed that he meant they EACH cost $1.10. After all he did not say the sum of the cost or that ""together"" they cost. I then went on to conclude the next two sentences were wrong.So does that make me stupid?Here's another one: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?According to the author the answer is determined whether the reader will remember that Detroit is in Michigan.OK. But the question was not whether Michigan has a high rate of murders, or higher than other states. The question was what number of murders occur in Michigan. Isn't that what ""how many murders"" means?My answer was, how the heck do I know the number of murders that occur anywhere without consulting a reliable census source?Needless to say I found this book frustrating and not a very reliable source for learning about cognitive functions."

It also means I finished a book that I bought in 2015 ""because it was a book one ought to read"". I couldn't voluntarily take it off the shelf to read. What got me to read and finish and enjoy this book was reading it with some colleagues at work. The issue came up during a training class - I actually do not remember how - and several of us decided that we would read a section of the book every two weeks. There were five sections so we would finish in approximately 10 weeks. This way, there was room for busy events at work that could keep us from reading or the events of our own lives. The period of two weeks wasn't too long so that fast readers would get impatient or bored, or that anyone would forget anything. We met for only 30 minutes - either during lunch or a short time after where we each stated one thing we liked and one thing we disliked, after which we could have a free discussion. Stating one thing we liked or disliked was merely a device for ensuring all could be heard and to try to structure our thoughts in the short time frame.It worked. But I am not finished with the book. Oh yes, I read the book. However, this is not a quick read that you put back on the shelf and ignore. There are some heavy-duty thoughts in here that I, for one, will need to lean on for a long time when referencing points during a discussion. Also, some parts were a little over my head - I haven't studied probability so I lacked the vocabulary to grasp those areas well. However, to Kahneman's praise, his writing meant that I could plow through those bits and still get his point.I have already been recommending this book to others. While carrying it around at work for our meetings, some people I knew would say ""oh, excellent book"", so it almost became a secret handshake. :)All in all, I had a good experience reading and digesting this book. :)"
784,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"If you want to read a layman's introduction into the psychology of decision making, Kahneman's book is probably the best. Dan Ariely has written similar books, but his are kind of jokey, lightweight, and unnuanced. Thinking, Fast and Slow is unlike most bestsellers in that it assumes the reader is intelligent and isn't on the beach or skimming. It's not particularly engaging - Kahneman's writing is on the dry and pedantic side - but this book is carefully written, and packed with fifty years of work in the field of decision making. While of course Kahneman tends to focus on his own research, he is very generous in citing and lauding the work of others. In a lot of ways, this book is a very impressive achievement.Unlike Ariely, Kahneman doesn't emphasize the follies in the way our brain works. Rather he very simply, plainly, and convincingly shows how we as humans tend to go from point A to point B in our thinking. The examples he uses are very easy to grasp if you are a careful reader. I'd say, using the parlance of Kahneman, that if you have a well developed System 2 - patience and a love of slow thinking - and an interest in how humans think you'll enjoy this book. It's probably also true that the kind of person who'll find Thinking, Fast and Slow interesting will consistently find that he or she is in the minority population in the examples cited. At least that's what I found. If Kahneman says something like 84 percent will say A and 16 percent will say B in response to a question, I'll be in the 16 percent. Finding myself consistently in the minority was an illuminating thing, actually. I've always ascribed my tendency for oddball thinking to my strange background of growing up around war survivors and Hassidic Jews. Nope. Now I realize that I'm just a System 2 kind of guy."
785,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"4Thinking, Fast and Slow for the better part is a solid and interesting read. My central complaint is the repetitive later sections of the book. Apart from that this is a must-read book for everybody. Understanding the way you think is worth the early chapters, and it's quite a simplistic design for consumption. It does get heavy in the latter half of the book, and to be honest I was quite bored here myself. But, make no mistake, Daniel Kahneman has created something unique and informative. The structure of the book was interesting, with the common stage 1 & 2 mapped throughout. I will say this, you won't finish the book and not understand these two meanings. There feels like a repeat of information here, but there is a lot to digest. I quite liked the idea of the book and I think structurally it's okay. Some of the information should've been condensed at times, but more might be something the majority of readers wanted. I enjoy reading books like this to understand the why. This book explains so much and that's why I continued to read and finish it. Why the 4?I can understand why certain reviews have marked it tedious. I get that. I did found it tough to read in that final 100 pages, but I was more engaged with finishing and information overload. This is a good book. The author has thrown in so much, so in hindsight I would recommend slowly digesting if you're allowed. That comment is more to the owner of the book, the library reader has to make the call based on the amount of people in the waiting list. I discovered a lot here, and as creatures of habit, you will notice these examples day after day. You can't unread what you've learned. I recommend reading this and not force reading it like I did. It's a book to slow down and read from time to time. "

I would just like to be able to memorize it all.The insight of making us understand how the human mind works and why we make some choices, is just brilliant.The only regret I have is that even if you read and understand things， the way our brain is wired， its software， can not be easily changed. This means that even if you are aware of things， it does not mean you are not susceptible for falling into traps. I cannot copy here the entire book content， but I will give an example:<“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion”. Moses took no animals into the ark;Noah did. The Moses illusion is explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context， and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him， but the mention of his name is not surprising. It also helps that Moses and Noah have the same vowel sound and number of syllables， so you unconsciously detect associative coherence between “Moses” and “ark” and so quickly accept the question. Replace Moses with George W Bush in this sentence and you will have a poor political joke but no illusion.>"
787,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16459651-allie,1,"This book was repetitive and tedious. I had to read it for a course, and I would definitely not have bothered otherwise. Within the first part of this book you've experienced all there is to experience. Kahneman goes through this book repeating the same theories in different ways again and again. Every now and then there will be a brief interlude of him bragging about his Nobel Prize or some other research he did that doesn't fully apply. This book got off to quite a bad start with me as it is 100% directed at Americans. I felt like many of the examples just confused the points more as they were based on knowledge that I, as an Australian, do not have just generally. He also frequently gives an example of an effect and then says ""You thought this"". A majority of the time though I did not think what he claimed, making me frustrated at the writing and the theory he then presented. I feel like this book was very much a cocky piece of writing in which the author frequently claimed that as a population we're pretty stupid. I can understand this was not his intention, but it came across that way. If you do want to read this book, I suggest a brief skimming of the conclusions section in the back. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. "

Curiously; he only devotes one chapter of this book to his field of expertise (but it is a heck of a chapter; I tell ya) He explains how our brains think in two ways: slow and fast. Our fast brain help us make quick decisions so we don't get ran over by cars or hit by balls; or stand up for days on the supermarket isles deciding which product to buy. The second system thinks more slowly and that is the one that help us make the most important decisions in our lives like to whom we will get married and for whom we should work. Well; those two systems trend to interact and screw up each other; so this is why the world is so screwed up. The book is pretty scientific; and dense. I understood probably a third of it; but I liked chap. 1 and the conclussions; and I honestly tried the statistics one (chap 3;4) and the economics ones (5); but as I said it was difficult. I think this book would be very good as an object of study in specialized classes. I really liked it. I gave it 9 weeks of my time. It is really good.
789,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16430203-swaroop,4,"This is a great book to read for anyone with a passing interest in behavioral economics. It's significantly more detailed and scientific than other pop-science books in the genre by Malcolm Gladwell et al.You can break up the book into 3 parts.In the first part, he dismantles the rational choice theory. Kahneman says he is not out to dismantle classical economic theory, according to him, he is not questioning the rational agent theory, he is just establishing that humans are not rational agents. (Cool story bro.)He then proceeds to dismantle another popular assumption, that humans always try to maximize utility. The third part of the book, about the 'science of happiness' was easily the least interesting part of the book. Coincidentally, this part of the book comprises mostly of work done after Tversky's death. My biggest problem with this book and many other books of this genre is the constant repetition. Frankly, this book is much better than others in this respect. That only speaks to how absurd other books are.This was a fantastic read but I think I am done with books like this for a while."

I had put this book down when I was younger and determined to take up this challenge for myself, I decided to read 50 pages per day years later. And I completed it within a month! Undoubtedly, my most difficult and yet enriching, it almost felt like attending economics classes and feeling doubly intelligent while reading this one. Daniel Kahneman is a Genius...He talks about how our mind processes things, how judgements happen and why we jump to conclusions, why we always chose the easy way to do things, risk luck and intuition and many more theories. ..Don’t buy this one if you’re looking for an easy-breezy read, but if you’re willing to dive into making your brain take the harder way into understanding these concepts, on Economics and Behavioural Psychology with interesting case studies, don’t miss this one written by a Nobel Laureate ⭐️"

I had initially dismissed this book without reading it, thinking it would be about business/economics (I’d blame it on the blurb found on the cover, something from the author of Freakonomics). I read it because I found out it’s a pretty famous book on Goodreads.com I enjoyed parts of the book; I’d say 3/5th of it. I had skimmed through mostly the rest of it as it was too technical. The book is a very deep and technical study (as far as I’m concerned) on behavioural sciences and economics. But whatever I did read, it was excellent. The use of examples and sample question scenarios helped in understanding how the brain works and how & why we think the way we think. It is not a light read; it required me to sit up and actively understand it. Not really my type of a book, and I probably wouldn’t want to read anything similar. "

Although I appreciate the detail in which the author goes into, at times it was a bit much for me, which made it a sluggish read at times.I did like how Kahneman, to demonstrate concepts, asks you questions or has you look at pictures, and then explains what was occurring in your mind during that exercise.

Drawing on knowledge acquired from years of research in cognitive and social psychology, Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Daniel Kahneman delivers his magnum opus on Behavioral Economics. This excellent book focuses on the three key sets of distinctions: between the automatic System 1 and the effortful System 2, between the conception of agents in classical economics and in behavioral economics, and between the experiencing and the remembering selves. This enlightening 512-page book is composed of thirty-eight chapters and broken out by the following five Parts: Part I. Two Systems, Part II. Heuristics and Biases, Part III. Overconfidence, Part IV. Choices, and Part V. Two Selves.Positives:1.	Award-winning research. A masterpiece of behavioral economics knowledge. Overall accessible.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of a master. How the mind works. The biases of intuition, judgment, and decision making. 3.	Excellent format. Each chapter is well laid out and ends with a Speaking of section that summarizes the content via quotes.4.	A great job of defining and summarizing new terms. ""In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."" 5.	Supports findings with countless research. Provides many accessible and practical examples that help readers understand the insightful conclusions.6.	A great job of letting us what we know and to what degree. ""It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work.""7.	You are guaranteed to learn something. Countless tidbits of knowledge throughout this insightful book and how it applies to the read world. ""The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.""8.	The differences of Systems 1 and 2 and how they function with one another. ""System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."" ""System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.""9.	Important recurring concepts like WYSIATI (What You See Is All There IS). ""You surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle.""10.	Understanding heuristics and biases. ""The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.""11.	Paradoxical results for your enjoyment. ""People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it.""12.	Understanding how our brains work, ""The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.""13.	Wisdom. ""'Risk' does not exist 'out there,' independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as 'real risk' or 'objective risk.'"" Bonus. ""To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.""14.	You will learn lessons that are practical. ""Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.""15.	An interesting look at overconfidence. ""Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."" ""Remember this rule: intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.""16.	Have you ever had to plan anything in your life? Meet the planning fallacy. ""This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an “outside view” and is the cure to the planning fallacy.""17.	A very interesting look at Econs and Humans. ""Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices.""18.	 Prospect theory explained. ""The pain of losing $900 is more than 90% of the pain of losing $1,000. These two insights are the essence of prospect theory.""19.	Avoiding poor psychology. ""The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.""20.	Great stuff on well being. 21.	An excellent Conclusions chapter that ties the book up comprehensively.Negatives:1.	Notes not linked up.2.	No formal separate bibliography.3.	Requires an investment of time. Thankfully, the book is worthy of your time.4.	The book overall is very well-written and accessible but some topics are challenging. 5.	Wanted more clarification on how Bayes's rules work.In summary, a masterpiece on behavioral economics. Dr. Kahneman shares his years of research and provides readers with an education on how the mind works. It requires an investment of your time but it so well worth it.

798,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41549696-jennifer-malinowski,4,"Very long book (the audiobook seemed to drag on interminably at times) describing Kahneman's premise that people have two different strategies for decision-making, called System 1 and System 2 (Fast and Slow). Overall, I think the book is a decent introduction for someone who is interested in why we make the choices we do, who doesn't already have a grasp of the theories or recently published studies in psychology and economics. That said, if you do, I don't think you'd find this book as interesting or helpful in extending your knowledge. Though by no means an expert in either, I have followed both fields, particularly where they intersect and have to do with consumer decision-making, and subsequently felt the book dragged on in parts and at times, even felt a little dated.Overall, a very solid 4* read. "
799,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009217-jonathan-donihue,5,"First off, I just want to say that this was one of the most arduous reading experiences of my life. ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is an amazing book, but it's not a casual read. That being said, I think it's one of the most important books of our time.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is a book about how we, as humans, make decisions. The author, Daniel Kahneman is an Economist and Nobel Laureate who has spent a lifetime (he's 82 years old) studying why we make stupid decisions. Alright, that's actually a bit simplistic. He and his partner, Amos Tversky, spent their entire careers studying how we decide things.In this book, Kahneman asks us to imagine that our minds are actually two distinct beings - beings that he (and other economists and psychologists) refer to as 'System 1' and 'System 2'. ""... I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make."" - Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 13). I would describe the 'two agents' as follows: System 1 is intuitive, emotional, artistic, imaginative, creative, spontaneous, forgetful, vain, superstitious, illogical, and capricious. System 2 is logical, deliberative, suspicious, wary, calculating, practical, attentive, just, predictable, and (unfortunately) indolent.Now, when you think about it, this internal dynamic is not really a new discovery. The innate dichotomy of the human mind has been a source of introspection, conversation, speculation, and proselytization for thousands of years. What makes this book different than the rest, though, is the lack of condemnation of either of the Systems of thought. Instead of venerating one and vilifying the other, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" focuses on the dynamic between the two systems of thought and shows how, if we understand and accept ourselves fully, we can make full use of the best aspects of our two selves and avoid the less desirable aspects.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is full to the brim with statistics and survey results and laborious studies and quotes from esoteric scientific papers. As such, I found it a very challenging read. Nonetheless, in spite of the difficult subject matter, Kahneman is able to keep it real. Real world anecdotes and easy to imagine thought experiments are woven into the narrative to help the lay person (like me) to more fully grok the subject matter. Additionally, each chapter sticks to one topic and ends with a summery that's designed to help the reader remember what was covered and to provide some simple ways that we can use the chapters lessons in our everyday lives. Theses summaries take the form ""Speaking of........) Here are some examples from the book:Chapter 1 - Speaking of System 1 and System 2 “He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.” “This was a pure System 1 response. She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.” “This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.”Chapter 5 -Speaking of Cognitive Ease""Let's not dismiss their business plan just because the font makes it hard to read.""""We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but let's think it through again.""""Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.""""I'm in a good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.""Chapter 36 - Speaking of Life as a Story “He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.” “The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.” “You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?” “She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”Chapter 37 - Speaking of Experienced Well-Being “The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.” “The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?” “Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.”Although the author didn't say anything in the book about spiritual growth, from my perspective, the entire book was a textbook on the subject of self mastery. I believe that it could be used in combination with specifically adapted meditation practices and lifestyle changes as primary source-book for a serious spiritual development class or group."
800,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57346995-lexy,3,I thought that this book was okay 
801,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9485245-prashant,5,"Thinking fast and slow is a book that came along in 2011 though I still feel that it’s one of the most relevant and important books of its times. Personally, for me, it’s one of those books where every time you read it, you are able to learn something new.Though there is a caveat: This is a book which will scare you the moment you will pick it, as it's a heavy book to read, though if you can fight back and finish the first 100 pages then I can assure you that the writing of Daniel Kanheman will be able to keep you intrigued in the book until you finish it. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.  Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Though we do need to talk a little about the author as well i.e. Daniel Kahneman, is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is seen by many as one of the world’s most important thinkers. So, If you are thinking, I am in sales and how would this book help in my subject then for your surprise, his research influences our daily lives in a big way, for example, he gives an example of a situation in which people who are risk-averse, becomes risky and vice versa. He helps us understand, how our minds work in perceiving a statement and how it influences our decisions. If you are feeling that I have a boring, normal job then why should I read this book- then it could help you understand when we should approach people to get a decision in our favor i.e. you should approach your boss for raise when his tummy is full and he is happy as that’s the time when people actually put their guards down and use their intuitions more than their brains.If you are a stock-broker then it gives the perfect advice to not follow your stocks on a regular basis and looking them only once a quarter to generate better returns. There are so many words of wisdom in this book that it’s difficult for me to capture all over here and I can assure you that it’s tougher to implement those in your life, ergo, I have decided to read this book every year and I feel that it’s definitely not a bad decision. The last section of the book explores the contrasting ‘selves’ embodied in every individual: the remembering self and the experiencing self. The remembering self refers to the aspect in our nature that evaluates episodes by the lasting memory they leave; the one that keeps track of goals and keeps mental accounts; that answers the question: how satisfied are you with your life? The experiencing self is the aspect that feels every moment; that evaluates pleasure and pain on the go. Interestingly, these two selves are in conflict. The remembering self overweights the end of an episode and is indifferent to duration; it often promotes actions based on the memory that will result. Paradoxically, people may prefer an experience that is more painful in aggregate sum than another simply as a result of it ending on a less painful note.Kahneman concludes that both selves are necessary for evaluating subjective wellbeing, as both give us important information. Focusing exclusively on one or the other therefore excludes an important aspect of wellbeing.This book succeeds in instilling an awareness of the many biases and heuristics that lead to errors of judgments and poor decision-making. Above all, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a highly enjoyable and informative read for anyone wanting an insight into the human mind. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."

Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."

804,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,4,"Daniel Kahneman was one of my professor's phd advisor at Princeton, and you can tell. Before reading this book I had a chance to be part of all these tiny experiments and see on my own mind where I have a bias and where I naturally tend to use ""system 2"" for my own good. Like everyone else, I have my goods and bads too, and this book does a very good job to explain *why* one might respond in a particular way to a question, but I have no idea how to correct them besides trying hard to be careful - which contradicts the definition of a bias really, so maybe they're not fixable. Having been through many of the experiments in this book (as well as the ones in Choices, values & frames, which I plan to read as well soon), I'm now really glad that I postponed reading this by two years! (The size was initially overwhelming, but it turned out to be a very casual read)The book feels very cozy after having been through the experiments, but it's great nevertheless, regardless of this practical stuff. I do wish that more of those posting on fb 10 strong opinions on 10 different subjects / day would read it too :)Some of my favorite quotes:In 1955, as a twenty-one-year-old lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces, I was assigned to set up an interview system for the entire army. If you wonder why such a responsibility would be forced upon someone so young, bear in mind that the state of Israel itself was only seven years old at the time.Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgement is missing - what we see is all there is. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. [...] Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.""How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?"" The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the ""Moses illusion"". Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did."
805,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is a book I'm more glad I have read than I actually enjoyed reading it. My favorite passage, incidentally, came in the introduction, when the author describes his working relationship with a close collaborator and which I identified with strongly. Several other points I took away are as follows:--the difference between thinking actively and passively, and particularly, that active thinking affects behavior in other ways (making people more selfish, superficial, and sexist). I identify with this based on how people perceive me when I'm exceptionally busy.--the concept of ""what you see is all there is,"" and particularly of priming effects, and implicit influence of what's in front of you. (My boss seems especially vulnerable to this!) As well this makes me rededicate myself to the theory that you should hire people based on their resumes rather than interviews; or at the very least employ your judgment only after scoring candidates (or other things, it's relevant more broadly) on more objective metrics--a valuable construct in business, to postulate how things could go wrong, as a method to avoid groupthink, encourage creative thinking, and make sure opposing ideas are heard--the difference in risk aversion with respect to gains and losses...not taking good gambles, and preferring risky gambles to limit losses. The author points out that most people avoid this pitfall when the games are presented as one they would play multiple times, but also highlight that in life, any gamble is almost certainly one of many. However, despite this interesting research, I found this book rather dry, and I read almost exclusively non-fiction. As well, the author's many references to the influence of his work, his Nobel Prize, etc., grew old by the end. The format, of repeating the research results in several different ways, with somewhat cheesy examples at the end of each chapter, was a bit didactic for me. But I did learn a good amount. "
806,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8070622-adam-morva,5,"When I'm hungry I tend to make myself bigger servings of meals than I can comfortably eat, and I always want to buy more food and snacks in the supermarket than I need. We could call this a bias, I suppose. Some primal part of my mind gets bathed in hunger hormones and such, and it makes me do things I shouldn't be doing, and those things would make me fat, so I learned to control this hellish urge, and whenever I do the groceries hungry, I remind myself of this fact. Whenever I start a meal really hungry I pick less food than what my eyes desire, and even gulp down a glass of water in order to ease my sense of hunger a bit.Why do I tell you this?Because some reviewers have said that it's useless to read about our mental short circuits, because we can't possibly do anything about them.Wrong. We can!Identifying your biases and intellectual pitfalls is the first step to combating them.Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about much more nuanced, and much less obvious circuits of thinking, and boy, it talks about a lot of them. I fancy myself a skeptic, a scientist, a student of thinking, so I've already known about most of the topics this book touches, and while it is not a complete list of all our intellectual quirks, IT TOOK ME YEARS to learn about the ones found in the book. So dear potential reader, you are lucky, because thanks to this wonderful book, you get to learn about them in the space of a lazy weekend (499 pages).Whether you are a big time corporate fatcat, a teacher, or a soccer mom, you'll benefit greatly from keeping at least some of Kahneman's conclusions in mind, because you are human, and we humans need to learn how to think, because we tend to make all sorts of mistakes."

Thinking, Fast and Slow is the product of new (at the time) research on quick, mostly subconscious, intuitive thought and deliberate, logical thought. The major insight from this book is the many, many ways that the intuition can be misled and provide one with faulty conclusions. This insight was most applicable to me as I consider my role on a book acquisition committee, as my team meets regularly to collectively decide which book proposals to accept and reject. There is immense potential for intuitive factors to weigh largely in these decisions as we make a long series of important decisions carefully but with necessary time restrictions. I strongly advise anyone in similar decision-making situations to read this book, or another book on this topic. It will give you good tools for careful thinking and for helping others avoid unwarranted conclusions. One reason you might choose not to read this book is that it is quite long and dedicates too much space to describing his research methodology. I would also have preferred more discussion of ways that a well-developed intuition can be an asset (though Kahnneman appropriately points out that awareness of intuition pitfalls can, over time, lead to better intuition). Another book I've read, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do does this well and would be a good companion or follow-up to this book."

Most of the books I give 4-star reviews to are well written and interesting, but not important per se, like Harry Potter or David McCulluogh's book on the building of the Panama Canal. No matter how good those books are, they're not exactly life changing. Thinking, Fast and Slow is well written and quite interesting, but beyond that I think it's an important book because it explains so much about how we think, why we make the choices we make, and how we can make better choices as well as help others to make better choices. As I read it I found myself thinking I need to read this about 10 times and take notes about how to apply it to my business, my family, and my other relationships. There is just so much useful stuff in the book. I could use it to change the language I use on my business website, I could use it to change how I communicate with my children, and I could use it to change how I interact with my spouse. There is so much knowledge packed into this, and I especially appreciate how, at the end of each chapter, Kahneman gives a few 1-2 sentence practical examples of how his research can be used in the real world."
809,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre,3,"I bought the audiobook for this after a reviewer of Chuck Klosterman's latest book drew a parallel with THINKING, FAST AND SLOW and OF COURSE both books have nothing to do with one another. How do I keep getting suckered into reading these books about cognitive biases and heuristics, I do not know. This one's pretty well made though and exposes a theory of two thought system: an intuitive one that takes instant decisions (like putting pants on in the morning) and hardwired to create coherence out of everything. It is this brain that scares people watching horror movies. There is also the second thought system that can very well override the first, which leads to conscious cognition. So that's cool and it's very enlightening to learn how to differentiate the two in your daily reactions.The book can't transcend its nature though as it plays it safe with its own scientific angle and ends up being just a list of situations where heuristics are involved. There are a lot of books like this available on the market albeit it is quite well done. It can get mind-numbing after a while and especially if you read the audiobook version like I did. Wanted to throw myself off a cliff after 15 or so hours."

I had put this in my every year to-read-list for 3 consecutive years and the hope of finishing it had been thin. This time last year I picked up Leonardo da Vinci and it dragged on for 6 months. I learned a valuable lesson from then on, that’s it’s okay to have an affair with books. While reading this book, I've swept through a whole YA Fantasy series and even started another book. What kept me afloat was a simple rule, I only had to read this book 1 hour every day, then I could be off to read whatever I want. There were days my will power was too low that I might give myself a break by immersing on a romance novel and come back fresher the next day.   2 months came by like a rush, and now I feel sorry this book ended so soon.    Why do we need to read this book when we can read a summary version of it online and eagerly tell anyone who asks that this book was a-okay? Because you read to understand. Only when you can summarise this book from your own understanding of it can you know that it will stick with you and be of help in your life for a long time. Please do not read this if you have no interest in human behaviors, you do not really care why we do what we do, or how we make mistakes, how we come up with decisions. That time can be well spent doing many things else but reading Thinking, Fast and SlowHowever if you need to understand this fast for work or any project, you can read 2 of the authors’ researches that built up this book, then start reading the book when you feel up for the commitment.And now the question is, when will I finish Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder? "
811,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"My favorite passage: ""When I asked my large undergraduate class in some indignation, 'Do you realize that you have violated an elementary logical rule?' someone in the back row shouted, 'So what?'"" (p.158).Most relevant for me were the many examples of the striking differences in between subjects and within subjects experiments. So, for example, when subjects were asked to judge the value of the following sets of dinnerware presented together, they judged set A as more valuable:SET A: 40 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good condition8 cups, 2 of them broken8 saucers, 7 of them brokenSET B: 24 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good conditionBut when subjects saw only one or the other of the two sets, they judged SET B to be worth more than SET A. Why? When presented with the sets together, they could make a comparative judgment and see that SET A contained more items in good shape than set B. But seen individually, they make a snap judgment of average value of the items in the set, which is higher in SET B than in SET A. I couldn't help but think about the relevance of this idea when you're putting your CV together. Say there are two candidates for a job. Candidate A has two publications in really good journals. Candidate B has two publications in equally good journals, and also two publications in unrefereed conference proceedings or journals edited by her friends. Considered side by side, maybe Candidate B has a slight advantage over A, but considered individually, Candidate A looks better. The average level of her publications is higher than B's. Maybe I should prune my list of conference presentations in light of this finding.Kahneman says (p.354) that ""We normally experience life in the between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent..."" and that in making decisions we should encourage consideration of ""broad context"", which includes alternatives (p.361). This is clearly relevant to debates about contextualism and invariantism, conversational context, and the standard linguistic methodology of eliciting intuitions from subjects about individual cases isolated from contrasting cases.

Maybe it's my problem. Maybe I just think differently. I suspect this book is written for left brained thinkers. I am very much a right brained thinker. Consequently, the author would pose a problem, assume the reader came to a certain conclusion, then built his thesis on the conclusion he assumes the reader arrived at. The problem was I never I arrived at his preconceived conclusions. Maybe because he assumes our brains all work a certain way. Ironic at that.Here's some examples. He gives a problem and tells us not to try to solve it but listen to our intuition:A ball and a bat cost $1.10The bat cost one dollar more than the bat.How much does the ball cost?Then he goes on to explain that the number that came to our mind was 10 cents because the ""distinctive mark of an easy puzzle is intuitive, appealing and wrong."" Then he informs us that the actual cost of the ball is 5 cents.But that is not how I read the problem. And since I didn't know where he was going with the puzzle, I assumed he was testing our ability to catch logical fallacies.When the statement said a ball and a bat cost $1.10, I assumed that he meant they EACH cost $1.10. After all he did not say the sum of the cost or that ""together"" they cost. I then went on to conclude the next two sentences were wrong.So does that make me stupid?Here's another one: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?According to the author the answer is determined whether the reader will remember that Detroit is in Michigan.OK. But the question was not whether Michigan has a high rate of murders, or higher than other states. The question was what number of murders occur in Michigan. Isn't that what ""how many murders"" means?My answer was, how the heck do I know the number of murders that occur anywhere without consulting a reliable census source?Needless to say I found this book frustrating and not a very reliable source for learning about cognitive functions."
813,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,5,"Finishing this book means I completed my 2017 Reading Challenge here on Goodreads. It also means I finished a book that I bought in 2015 ""because it was a book one ought to read"". I couldn't voluntarily take it off the shelf to read. What got me to read and finish and enjoy this book was reading it with some colleagues at work. The issue came up during a training class - I actually do not remember how - and several of us decided that we would read a section of the book every two weeks. There were five sections so we would finish in approximately 10 weeks. This way, there was room for busy events at work that could keep us from reading or the events of our own lives. The period of two weeks wasn't too long so that fast readers would get impatient or bored, or that anyone would forget anything. We met for only 30 minutes - either during lunch or a short time after where we each stated one thing we liked and one thing we disliked, after which we could have a free discussion. Stating one thing we liked or disliked was merely a device for ensuring all could be heard and to try to structure our thoughts in the short time frame.It worked. But I am not finished with the book. Oh yes, I read the book. However, this is not a quick read that you put back on the shelf and ignore. There are some heavy-duty thoughts in here that I, for one, will need to lean on for a long time when referencing points during a discussion. Also, some parts were a little over my head - I haven't studied probability so I lacked the vocabulary to grasp those areas well. However, to Kahneman's praise, his writing meant that I could plow through those bits and still get his point.I have already been recommending this book to others. While carrying it around at work for our meetings, some people I knew would say ""oh, excellent book"", so it almost became a secret handshake. :)All in all, I had a good experience reading and digesting this book. :)"
814,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"If you want to read a layman's introduction into the psychology of decision making, Kahneman's book is probably the best. Dan Ariely has written similar books, but his are kind of jokey, lightweight, and unnuanced. Thinking, Fast and Slow is unlike most bestsellers in that it assumes the reader is intelligent and isn't on the beach or skimming. It's not particularly engaging - Kahneman's writing is on the dry and pedantic side - but this book is carefully written, and packed with fifty years of work in the field of decision making. While of course Kahneman tends to focus on his own research, he is very generous in citing and lauding the work of others. In a lot of ways, this book is a very impressive achievement.Unlike Ariely, Kahneman doesn't emphasize the follies in the way our brain works. Rather he very simply, plainly, and convincingly shows how we as humans tend to go from point A to point B in our thinking. The examples he uses are very easy to grasp if you are a careful reader. I'd say, using the parlance of Kahneman, that if you have a well developed System 2 - patience and a love of slow thinking - and an interest in how humans think you'll enjoy this book. It's probably also true that the kind of person who'll find Thinking, Fast and Slow interesting will consistently find that he or she is in the minority population in the examples cited. At least that's what I found. If Kahneman says something like 84 percent will say A and 16 percent will say B in response to a question, I'll be in the 16 percent. Finding myself consistently in the minority was an illuminating thing, actually. I've always ascribed my tendency for oddball thinking to my strange background of growing up around war survivors and Hassidic Jews. Nope. Now I realize that I'm just a System 2 kind of guy."
815,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"4Thinking, Fast and Slow for the better part is a solid and interesting read. My central complaint is the repetitive later sections of the book. Apart from that this is a must-read book for everybody. Understanding the way you think is worth the early chapters, and it's quite a simplistic design for consumption. It does get heavy in the latter half of the book, and to be honest I was quite bored here myself. But, make no mistake, Daniel Kahneman has created something unique and informative. The structure of the book was interesting, with the common stage 1 & 2 mapped throughout. I will say this, you won't finish the book and not understand these two meanings. There feels like a repeat of information here, but there is a lot to digest. I quite liked the idea of the book and I think structurally it's okay. Some of the information should've been condensed at times, but more might be something the majority of readers wanted. I enjoy reading books like this to understand the why. This book explains so much and that's why I continued to read and finish it. Why the 4?I can understand why certain reviews have marked it tedious. I get that. I did found it tough to read in that final 100 pages, but I was more engaged with finishing and information overload. This is a good book. The author has thrown in so much, so in hindsight I would recommend slowly digesting if you're allowed. That comment is more to the owner of the book, the library reader has to make the call based on the amount of people in the waiting list. I discovered a lot here, and as creatures of habit, you will notice these examples day after day. You can't unread what you've learned. I recommend reading this and not force reading it like I did. It's a book to slow down and read from time to time. "
816,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33537328-gheorghina,5,"This is one of the best books I have read. And for sure it is one that I will return to. I would just like to be able to memorize it all.The insight of making us understand how the human mind works and why we make some choices, is just brilliant.The only regret I have is that even if you read and understand things， the way our brain is wired， its software， can not be easily changed. This means that even if you are aware of things， it does not mean you are not susceptible for falling into traps. I cannot copy here the entire book content， but I will give an example:<“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion”. Moses took no animals into the ark;Noah did. The Moses illusion is explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context， and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him， but the mention of his name is not surprising. It also helps that Moses and Noah have the same vowel sound and number of syllables， so you unconsciously detect associative coherence between “Moses” and “ark” and so quickly accept the question. Replace Moses with George W Bush in this sentence and you will have a poor political joke but no illusion.>"
817,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16459651-allie,1,"This book was repetitive and tedious. I had to read it for a course, and I would definitely not have bothered otherwise. Within the first part of this book you've experienced all there is to experience. Kahneman goes through this book repeating the same theories in different ways again and again. Every now and then there will be a brief interlude of him bragging about his Nobel Prize or some other research he did that doesn't fully apply. This book got off to quite a bad start with me as it is 100% directed at Americans. I felt like many of the examples just confused the points more as they were based on knowledge that I, as an Australian, do not have just generally. He also frequently gives an example of an effect and then says ""You thought this"". A majority of the time though I did not think what he claimed, making me frustrated at the writing and the theory he then presented. I feel like this book was very much a cocky piece of writing in which the author frequently claimed that as a population we're pretty stupid. I can understand this was not his intention, but it came across that way. If you do want to read this book, I suggest a brief skimming of the conclusions section in the back. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. "
818,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7541671-ariadna73,5,Here is my comment in Spanish: http://bit.ly/XhWvoUDaniel Kahneman is a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. Curiously; he only devotes one chapter of this book to his field of expertise (but it is a heck of a chapter; I tell ya) He explains how our brains think in two ways: slow and fast. Our fast brain help us make quick decisions so we don't get ran over by cars or hit by balls; or stand up for days on the supermarket isles deciding which product to buy. The second system thinks more slowly and that is the one that help us make the most important decisions in our lives like to whom we will get married and for whom we should work. Well; those two systems trend to interact and screw up each other; so this is why the world is so screwed up. The book is pretty scientific; and dense. I understood probably a third of it; but I liked chap. 1 and the conclussions; and I honestly tried the statistics one (chap 3;4) and the economics ones (5); but as I said it was difficult. I think this book would be very good as an object of study in specialized classes. I really liked it. I gave it 9 weeks of my time. It is really good.
819,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16430203-swaroop,4,"This is a great book to read for anyone with a passing interest in behavioral economics. It's significantly more detailed and scientific than other pop-science books in the genre by Malcolm Gladwell et al.You can break up the book into 3 parts.In the first part, he dismantles the rational choice theory. Kahneman says he is not out to dismantle classical economic theory, according to him, he is not questioning the rational agent theory, he is just establishing that humans are not rational agents. (Cool story bro.)He then proceeds to dismantle another popular assumption, that humans always try to maximize utility. The third part of the book, about the 'science of happiness' was easily the least interesting part of the book. Coincidentally, this part of the book comprises mostly of work done after Tversky's death. My biggest problem with this book and many other books of this genre is the constant repetition. Frankly, this book is much better than others in this respect. That only speaks to how absurd other books are.This was a fantastic read but I think I am done with books like this for a while."

I had put this book down when I was younger and determined to take up this challenge for myself, I decided to read 50 pages per day years later. And I completed it within a month! Undoubtedly, my most difficult and yet enriching, it almost felt like attending economics classes and feeling doubly intelligent while reading this one. Daniel Kahneman is a Genius...He talks about how our mind processes things, how judgements happen and why we jump to conclusions, why we always chose the easy way to do things, risk luck and intuition and many more theories. ..Don’t buy this one if you’re looking for an easy-breezy read, but if you’re willing to dive into making your brain take the harder way into understanding these concepts, on Economics and Behavioural Psychology with interesting case studies, don’t miss this one written by a Nobel Laureate ⭐️"

I had initially dismissed this book without reading it, thinking it would be about business/economics (I’d blame it on the blurb found on the cover, something from the author of Freakonomics). I read it because I found out it’s a pretty famous book on Goodreads.com I enjoyed parts of the book; I’d say 3/5th of it. I had skimmed through mostly the rest of it as it was too technical. The book is a very deep and technical study (as far as I’m concerned) on behavioural sciences and economics. But whatever I did read, it was excellent. The use of examples and sample question scenarios helped in understanding how the brain works and how & why we think the way we think. It is not a light read; it required me to sit up and actively understand it. Not really my type of a book, and I probably wouldn’t want to read anything similar. "

Although I appreciate the detail in which the author goes into, at times it was a bit much for me, which made it a sluggish read at times.I did like how Kahneman, to demonstrate concepts, asks you questions or has you look at pictures, and then explains what was occurring in your mind during that exercise.

Drawing on knowledge acquired from years of research in cognitive and social psychology, Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Daniel Kahneman delivers his magnum opus on Behavioral Economics. This excellent book focuses on the three key sets of distinctions: between the automatic System 1 and the effortful System 2, between the conception of agents in classical economics and in behavioral economics, and between the experiencing and the remembering selves. This enlightening 512-page book is composed of thirty-eight chapters and broken out by the following five Parts: Part I. Two Systems, Part II. Heuristics and Biases, Part III. Overconfidence, Part IV. Choices, and Part V. Two Selves.Positives:1.	Award-winning research. A masterpiece of behavioral economics knowledge. Overall accessible.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of a master. How the mind works. The biases of intuition, judgment, and decision making. 3.	Excellent format. Each chapter is well laid out and ends with a Speaking of section that summarizes the content via quotes.4.	A great job of defining and summarizing new terms. ""In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."" 5.	Supports findings with countless research. Provides many accessible and practical examples that help readers understand the insightful conclusions.6.	A great job of letting us what we know and to what degree. ""It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work.""7.	You are guaranteed to learn something. Countless tidbits of knowledge throughout this insightful book and how it applies to the read world. ""The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.""8.	The differences of Systems 1 and 2 and how they function with one another. ""System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."" ""System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.""9.	Important recurring concepts like WYSIATI (What You See Is All There IS). ""You surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle.""10.	Understanding heuristics and biases. ""The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.""11.	Paradoxical results for your enjoyment. ""People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it.""12.	Understanding how our brains work, ""The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.""13.	Wisdom. ""'Risk' does not exist 'out there,' independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as 'real risk' or 'objective risk.'"" Bonus. ""To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.""14.	You will learn lessons that are practical. ""Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.""15.	An interesting look at overconfidence. ""Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."" ""Remember this rule: intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.""16.	Have you ever had to plan anything in your life? Meet the planning fallacy. ""This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an “outside view” and is the cure to the planning fallacy.""17.	A very interesting look at Econs and Humans. ""Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices.""18.	 Prospect theory explained. ""The pain of losing $900 is more than 90% of the pain of losing $1,000. These two insights are the essence of prospect theory.""19.	Avoiding poor psychology. ""The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.""20.	Great stuff on well being. 21.	An excellent Conclusions chapter that ties the book up comprehensively.Negatives:1.	Notes not linked up.2.	No formal separate bibliography.3.	Requires an investment of time. Thankfully, the book is worthy of your time.4.	The book overall is very well-written and accessible but some topics are challenging. 5.	Wanted more clarification on how Bayes's rules work.In summary, a masterpiece on behavioral economics. Dr. Kahneman shares his years of research and provides readers with an education on how the mind works. It requires an investment of your time but it so well worth it.

"
828,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41549696-jennifer-malinowski,4,"Very long book (the audiobook seemed to drag on interminably at times) describing Kahneman's premise that people have two different strategies for decision-making, called System 1 and System 2 (Fast and Slow). Overall, I think the book is a decent introduction for someone who is interested in why we make the choices we do, who doesn't already have a grasp of the theories or recently published studies in psychology and economics. That said, if you do, I don't think you'd find this book as interesting or helpful in extending your knowledge. Though by no means an expert in either, I have followed both fields, particularly where they intersect and have to do with consumer decision-making, and subsequently felt the book dragged on in parts and at times, even felt a little dated.Overall, a very solid 4* read. "
829,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009217-jonathan-donihue,5,"First off, I just want to say that this was one of the most arduous reading experiences of my life. ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is an amazing book, but it's not a casual read. That being said, I think it's one of the most important books of our time.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is a book about how we, as humans, make decisions. The author, Daniel Kahneman is an Economist and Nobel Laureate who has spent a lifetime (he's 82 years old) studying why we make stupid decisions. Alright, that's actually a bit simplistic. He and his partner, Amos Tversky, spent their entire careers studying how we decide things.In this book, Kahneman asks us to imagine that our minds are actually two distinct beings - beings that he (and other economists and psychologists) refer to as 'System 1' and 'System 2'. ""... I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make."" - Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 13). I would describe the 'two agents' as follows: System 1 is intuitive, emotional, artistic, imaginative, creative, spontaneous, forgetful, vain, superstitious, illogical, and capricious. System 2 is logical, deliberative, suspicious, wary, calculating, practical, attentive, just, predictable, and (unfortunately) indolent.Now, when you think about it, this internal dynamic is not really a new discovery. The innate dichotomy of the human mind has been a source of introspection, conversation, speculation, and proselytization for thousands of years. What makes this book different than the rest, though, is the lack of condemnation of either of the Systems of thought. Instead of venerating one and vilifying the other, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" focuses on the dynamic between the two systems of thought and shows how, if we understand and accept ourselves fully, we can make full use of the best aspects of our two selves and avoid the less desirable aspects.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is full to the brim with statistics and survey results and laborious studies and quotes from esoteric scientific papers. As such, I found it a very challenging read. Nonetheless, in spite of the difficult subject matter, Kahneman is able to keep it real. Real world anecdotes and easy to imagine thought experiments are woven into the narrative to help the lay person (like me) to more fully grok the subject matter. Additionally, each chapter sticks to one topic and ends with a summery that's designed to help the reader remember what was covered and to provide some simple ways that we can use the chapters lessons in our everyday lives. Theses summaries take the form ""Speaking of........) Here are some examples from the book:Chapter 1 - Speaking of System 1 and System 2 “He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.” “This was a pure System 1 response. She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.” “This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.”Chapter 5 -Speaking of Cognitive Ease""Let's not dismiss their business plan just because the font makes it hard to read.""""We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but let's think it through again.""""Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.""""I'm in a good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.""Chapter 36 - Speaking of Life as a Story “He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.” “The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.” “You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?” “She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”Chapter 37 - Speaking of Experienced Well-Being “The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.” “The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?” “Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.”Although the author didn't say anything in the book about spiritual growth, from my perspective, the entire book was a textbook on the subject of self mastery. I believe that it could be used in combination with specifically adapted meditation practices and lifestyle changes as primary source-book for a serious spiritual development class or group."

831,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9485245-prashant,5,"Thinking fast and slow is a book that came along in 2011 though I still feel that it’s one of the most relevant and important books of its times. Personally, for me, it’s one of those books where every time you read it, you are able to learn something new.Though there is a caveat: This is a book which will scare you the moment you will pick it, as it's a heavy book to read, though if you can fight back and finish the first 100 pages then I can assure you that the writing of Daniel Kanheman will be able to keep you intrigued in the book until you finish it. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.  Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Though we do need to talk a little about the author as well i.e. Daniel Kahneman, is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is seen by many as one of the world’s most important thinkers. So, If you are thinking, I am in sales and how would this book help in my subject then for your surprise, his research influences our daily lives in a big way, for example, he gives an example of a situation in which people who are risk-averse, becomes risky and vice versa. He helps us understand, how our minds work in perceiving a statement and how it influences our decisions. If you are feeling that I have a boring, normal job then why should I read this book- then it could help you understand when we should approach people to get a decision in our favor i.e. you should approach your boss for raise when his tummy is full and he is happy as that’s the time when people actually put their guards down and use their intuitions more than their brains.If you are a stock-broker then it gives the perfect advice to not follow your stocks on a regular basis and looking them only once a quarter to generate better returns. There are so many words of wisdom in this book that it’s difficult for me to capture all over here and I can assure you that it’s tougher to implement those in your life, ergo, I have decided to read this book every year and I feel that it’s definitely not a bad decision. The last section of the book explores the contrasting ‘selves’ embodied in every individual: the remembering self and the experiencing self. The remembering self refers to the aspect in our nature that evaluates episodes by the lasting memory they leave; the one that keeps track of goals and keeps mental accounts; that answers the question: how satisfied are you with your life? The experiencing self is the aspect that feels every moment; that evaluates pleasure and pain on the go. Interestingly, these two selves are in conflict. The remembering self overweights the end of an episode and is indifferent to duration; it often promotes actions based on the memory that will result. Paradoxically, people may prefer an experience that is more painful in aggregate sum than another simply as a result of it ending on a less painful note.Kahneman concludes that both selves are necessary for evaluating subjective wellbeing, as both give us important information. Focusing exclusively on one or the other therefore excludes an important aspect of wellbeing.This book succeeds in instilling an awareness of the many biases and heuristics that lead to errors of judgments and poor decision-making. Above all, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a highly enjoyable and informative read for anyone wanting an insight into the human mind. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."
832,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82596342-iman-shabani,5,"I still haven't read the whole book as most reviews mention the main topic could be said in a lot less pages without leaving out anything important, so I listened (and read) a couple of well-written summaries of it.However now that I'm done, and know what the book has to offer, I'm going to spend some more time on it and read it more thoroughly, maybe not very soon, considering its volume, but not-so-late either.I can recommend this book to you for sure, even if you're listening to only a summary of it. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."
833,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3279705-vivian-zhang,4,My goodness. I did not know our thoughts could be so contradictory!I definitely did not take the right type of notes while reading this book to best navigate how I will think in the future... would love to hear how others have internalized their lessons learned.
834,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,4,"Daniel Kahneman was one of my professor's phd advisor at Princeton, and you can tell. Before reading this book I had a chance to be part of all these tiny experiments and see on my own mind where I have a bias and where I naturally tend to use ""system 2"" for my own good. Like everyone else, I have my goods and bads too, and this book does a very good job to explain *why* one might respond in a particular way to a question, but I have no idea how to correct them besides trying hard to be careful - which contradicts the definition of a bias really, so maybe they're not fixable. Having been through many of the experiments in this book (as well as the ones in Choices, values & frames, which I plan to read as well soon), I'm now really glad that I postponed reading this by two years! (The size was initially overwhelming, but it turned out to be a very casual read)The book feels very cozy after having been through the experiments, but it's great nevertheless, regardless of this practical stuff. I do wish that more of those posting on fb 10 strong opinions on 10 different subjects / day would read it too :)Some of my favorite quotes:In 1955, as a twenty-one-year-old lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces, I was assigned to set up an interview system for the entire army. If you wonder why such a responsibility would be forced upon someone so young, bear in mind that the state of Israel itself was only seven years old at the time.Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgement is missing - what we see is all there is. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. [...] Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.""How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?"" The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the ""Moses illusion"". Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did."
835,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is a book I'm more glad I have read than I actually enjoyed reading it. My favorite passage, incidentally, came in the introduction, when the author describes his working relationship with a close collaborator and which I identified with strongly. Several other points I took away are as follows:--the difference between thinking actively and passively, and particularly, that active thinking affects behavior in other ways (making people more selfish, superficial, and sexist). I identify with this based on how people perceive me when I'm exceptionally busy.--the concept of ""what you see is all there is,"" and particularly of priming effects, and implicit influence of what's in front of you. (My boss seems especially vulnerable to this!) As well this makes me rededicate myself to the theory that you should hire people based on their resumes rather than interviews; or at the very least employ your judgment only after scoring candidates (or other things, it's relevant more broadly) on more objective metrics--a valuable construct in business, to postulate how things could go wrong, as a method to avoid groupthink, encourage creative thinking, and make sure opposing ideas are heard--the difference in risk aversion with respect to gains and losses...not taking good gambles, and preferring risky gambles to limit losses. The author points out that most people avoid this pitfall when the games are presented as one they would play multiple times, but also highlight that in life, any gamble is almost certainly one of many. However, despite this interesting research, I found this book rather dry, and I read almost exclusively non-fiction. As well, the author's many references to the influence of his work, his Nobel Prize, etc., grew old by the end. The format, of repeating the research results in several different ways, with somewhat cheesy examples at the end of each chapter, was a bit didactic for me. But I did learn a good amount. "
836,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8070622-adam-morva,5,"When I'm hungry I tend to make myself bigger servings of meals than I can comfortably eat, and I always want to buy more food and snacks in the supermarket than I need. We could call this a bias, I suppose. Some primal part of my mind gets bathed in hunger hormones and such, and it makes me do things I shouldn't be doing, and those things would make me fat, so I learned to control this hellish urge, and whenever I do the groceries hungry, I remind myself of this fact. Whenever I start a meal really hungry I pick less food than what my eyes desire, and even gulp down a glass of water in order to ease my sense of hunger a bit.Why do I tell you this?Because some reviewers have said that it's useless to read about our mental short circuits, because we can't possibly do anything about them.Wrong. We can!Identifying your biases and intellectual pitfalls is the first step to combating them.Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about much more nuanced, and much less obvious circuits of thinking, and boy, it talks about a lot of them. I fancy myself a skeptic, a scientist, a student of thinking, so I've already known about most of the topics this book touches, and while it is not a complete list of all our intellectual quirks, IT TOOK ME YEARS to learn about the ones found in the book. So dear potential reader, you are lucky, because thanks to this wonderful book, you get to learn about them in the space of a lazy weekend (499 pages).Whether you are a big time corporate fatcat, a teacher, or a soccer mom, you'll benefit greatly from keeping at least some of Kahneman's conclusions in mind, because you are human, and we humans need to learn how to think, because we tend to make all sorts of mistakes."
837,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013427-laura,4,"A groundbreaking book on the pitfalls of subconscious thought. Thinking, Fast and Slow is the product of new (at the time) research on quick, mostly subconscious, intuitive thought and deliberate, logical thought. The major insight from this book is the many, many ways that the intuition can be misled and provide one with faulty conclusions. This insight was most applicable to me as I consider my role on a book acquisition committee, as my team meets regularly to collectively decide which book proposals to accept and reject. There is immense potential for intuitive factors to weigh largely in these decisions as we make a long series of important decisions carefully but with necessary time restrictions. I strongly advise anyone in similar decision-making situations to read this book, or another book on this topic. It will give you good tools for careful thinking and for helping others avoid unwarranted conclusions. One reason you might choose not to read this book is that it is quite long and dedicates too much space to describing his research methodology. I would also have preferred more discussion of ways that a well-developed intuition can be an asset (though Kahnneman appropriately points out that awareness of intuition pitfalls can, over time, lead to better intuition). Another book I've read, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do does this well and would be a good companion or follow-up to this book."

Most of the books I give 4-star reviews to are well written and interesting, but not important per se, like Harry Potter or David McCulluogh's book on the building of the Panama Canal. No matter how good those books are, they're not exactly life changing. Thinking, Fast and Slow is well written and quite interesting, but beyond that I think it's an important book because it explains so much about how we think, why we make the choices we make, and how we can make better choices as well as help others to make better choices. As I read it I found myself thinking I need to read this about 10 times and take notes about how to apply it to my business, my family, and my other relationships. There is just so much useful stuff in the book. I could use it to change the language I use on my business website, I could use it to change how I communicate with my children, and I could use it to change how I interact with my spouse. There is so much knowledge packed into this, and I especially appreciate how, at the end of each chapter, Kahneman gives a few 1-2 sentence practical examples of how his research can be used in the real world."
839,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre,3,"I bought the audiobook for this after a reviewer of Chuck Klosterman's latest book drew a parallel with THINKING, FAST AND SLOW and OF COURSE both books have nothing to do with one another. How do I keep getting suckered into reading these books about cognitive biases and heuristics, I do not know. This one's pretty well made though and exposes a theory of two thought system: an intuitive one that takes instant decisions (like putting pants on in the morning) and hardwired to create coherence out of everything. It is this brain that scares people watching horror movies. There is also the second thought system that can very well override the first, which leads to conscious cognition. So that's cool and it's very enlightening to learn how to differentiate the two in your daily reactions.The book can't transcend its nature though as it plays it safe with its own scientific angle and ends up being just a list of situations where heuristics are involved. There are a lot of books like this available on the market albeit it is quite well done. It can get mind-numbing after a while and especially if you read the audiobook version like I did. Wanted to throw myself off a cliff after 15 or so hours."

I had put this in my every year to-read-list for 3 consecutive years and the hope of finishing it had been thin. This time last year I picked up Leonardo da Vinci and it dragged on for 6 months. I learned a valuable lesson from then on, that’s it’s okay to have an affair with books. While reading this book, I've swept through a whole YA Fantasy series and even started another book. What kept me afloat was a simple rule, I only had to read this book 1 hour every day, then I could be off to read whatever I want. There were days my will power was too low that I might give myself a break by immersing on a romance novel and come back fresher the next day.   2 months came by like a rush, and now I feel sorry this book ended so soon.    Why do we need to read this book when we can read a summary version of it online and eagerly tell anyone who asks that this book was a-okay? Because you read to understand. Only when you can summarise this book from your own understanding of it can you know that it will stick with you and be of help in your life for a long time. Please do not read this if you have no interest in human behaviors, you do not really care why we do what we do, or how we make mistakes, how we come up with decisions. That time can be well spent doing many things else but reading Thinking, Fast and SlowHowever if you need to understand this fast for work or any project, you can read 2 of the authors’ researches that built up this book, then start reading the book when you feel up for the commitment.And now the question is, when will I finish Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder? "
841,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"My favorite passage: ""When I asked my large undergraduate class in some indignation, 'Do you realize that you have violated an elementary logical rule?' someone in the back row shouted, 'So what?'"" (p.158).Most relevant for me were the many examples of the striking differences in between subjects and within subjects experiments. So, for example, when subjects were asked to judge the value of the following sets of dinnerware presented together, they judged set A as more valuable:SET A: 40 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good condition8 cups, 2 of them broken8 saucers, 7 of them brokenSET B: 24 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good conditionBut when subjects saw only one or the other of the two sets, they judged SET B to be worth more than SET A. Why? When presented with the sets together, they could make a comparative judgment and see that SET A contained more items in good shape than set B. But seen individually, they make a snap judgment of average value of the items in the set, which is higher in SET B than in SET A. I couldn't help but think about the relevance of this idea when you're putting your CV together. Say there are two candidates for a job. Candidate A has two publications in really good journals. Candidate B has two publications in equally good journals, and also two publications in unrefereed conference proceedings or journals edited by her friends. Considered side by side, maybe Candidate B has a slight advantage over A, but considered individually, Candidate A looks better. The average level of her publications is higher than B's. Maybe I should prune my list of conference presentations in light of this finding.Kahneman says (p.354) that ""We normally experience life in the between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent..."" and that in making decisions we should encourage consideration of ""broad context"", which includes alternatives (p.361). This is clearly relevant to debates about contextualism and invariantism, conversational context, and the standard linguistic methodology of eliciting intuitions from subjects about individual cases isolated from contrasting cases.

Maybe it's my problem. Maybe I just think differently. I suspect this book is written for left brained thinkers. I am very much a right brained thinker. Consequently, the author would pose a problem, assume the reader came to a certain conclusion, then built his thesis on the conclusion he assumes the reader arrived at. The problem was I never I arrived at his preconceived conclusions. Maybe because he assumes our brains all work a certain way. Ironic at that.Here's some examples. He gives a problem and tells us not to try to solve it but listen to our intuition:A ball and a bat cost $1.10The bat cost one dollar more than the bat.How much does the ball cost?Then he goes on to explain that the number that came to our mind was 10 cents because the ""distinctive mark of an easy puzzle is intuitive, appealing and wrong."" Then he informs us that the actual cost of the ball is 5 cents.But that is not how I read the problem. And since I didn't know where he was going with the puzzle, I assumed he was testing our ability to catch logical fallacies.When the statement said a ball and a bat cost $1.10, I assumed that he meant they EACH cost $1.10. After all he did not say the sum of the cost or that ""together"" they cost. I then went on to conclude the next two sentences were wrong.So does that make me stupid?Here's another one: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?According to the author the answer is determined whether the reader will remember that Detroit is in Michigan.OK. But the question was not whether Michigan has a high rate of murders, or higher than other states. The question was what number of murders occur in Michigan. Isn't that what ""how many murders"" means?My answer was, how the heck do I know the number of murders that occur anywhere without consulting a reliable census source?Needless to say I found this book frustrating and not a very reliable source for learning about cognitive functions."

It also means I finished a book that I bought in 2015 ""because it was a book one ought to read"". I couldn't voluntarily take it off the shelf to read. What got me to read and finish and enjoy this book was reading it with some colleagues at work. The issue came up during a training class - I actually do not remember how - and several of us decided that we would read a section of the book every two weeks. There were five sections so we would finish in approximately 10 weeks. This way, there was room for busy events at work that could keep us from reading or the events of our own lives. The period of two weeks wasn't too long so that fast readers would get impatient or bored, or that anyone would forget anything. We met for only 30 minutes - either during lunch or a short time after where we each stated one thing we liked and one thing we disliked, after which we could have a free discussion. Stating one thing we liked or disliked was merely a device for ensuring all could be heard and to try to structure our thoughts in the short time frame.It worked. But I am not finished with the book. Oh yes, I read the book. However, this is not a quick read that you put back on the shelf and ignore. There are some heavy-duty thoughts in here that I, for one, will need to lean on for a long time when referencing points during a discussion. Also, some parts were a little over my head - I haven't studied probability so I lacked the vocabulary to grasp those areas well. However, to Kahneman's praise, his writing meant that I could plow through those bits and still get his point.I have already been recommending this book to others. While carrying it around at work for our meetings, some people I knew would say ""oh, excellent book"", so it almost became a secret handshake. :)All in all, I had a good experience reading and digesting this book. :)"
844,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"If you want to read a layman's introduction into the psychology of decision making, Kahneman's book is probably the best. Dan Ariely has written similar books, but his are kind of jokey, lightweight, and unnuanced. Thinking, Fast and Slow is unlike most bestsellers in that it assumes the reader is intelligent and isn't on the beach or skimming. It's not particularly engaging - Kahneman's writing is on the dry and pedantic side - but this book is carefully written, and packed with fifty years of work in the field of decision making. While of course Kahneman tends to focus on his own research, he is very generous in citing and lauding the work of others. In a lot of ways, this book is a very impressive achievement.Unlike Ariely, Kahneman doesn't emphasize the follies in the way our brain works. Rather he very simply, plainly, and convincingly shows how we as humans tend to go from point A to point B in our thinking. The examples he uses are very easy to grasp if you are a careful reader. I'd say, using the parlance of Kahneman, that if you have a well developed System 2 - patience and a love of slow thinking - and an interest in how humans think you'll enjoy this book. It's probably also true that the kind of person who'll find Thinking, Fast and Slow interesting will consistently find that he or she is in the minority population in the examples cited. At least that's what I found. If Kahneman says something like 84 percent will say A and 16 percent will say B in response to a question, I'll be in the 16 percent. Finding myself consistently in the minority was an illuminating thing, actually. I've always ascribed my tendency for oddball thinking to my strange background of growing up around war survivors and Hassidic Jews. Nope. Now I realize that I'm just a System 2 kind of guy."
845,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"4Thinking, Fast and Slow for the better part is a solid and interesting read. My central complaint is the repetitive later sections of the book. Apart from that this is a must-read book for everybody. Understanding the way you think is worth the early chapters, and it's quite a simplistic design for consumption. It does get heavy in the latter half of the book, and to be honest I was quite bored here myself. But, make no mistake, Daniel Kahneman has created something unique and informative. The structure of the book was interesting, with the common stage 1 & 2 mapped throughout. I will say this, you won't finish the book and not understand these two meanings. There feels like a repeat of information here, but there is a lot to digest. I quite liked the idea of the book and I think structurally it's okay. Some of the information should've been condensed at times, but more might be something the majority of readers wanted. I enjoy reading books like this to understand the why. This book explains so much and that's why I continued to read and finish it. Why the 4?I can understand why certain reviews have marked it tedious. I get that. I did found it tough to read in that final 100 pages, but I was more engaged with finishing and information overload. This is a good book. The author has thrown in so much, so in hindsight I would recommend slowly digesting if you're allowed. That comment is more to the owner of the book, the library reader has to make the call based on the amount of people in the waiting list. I discovered a lot here, and as creatures of habit, you will notice these examples day after day. You can't unread what you've learned. I recommend reading this and not force reading it like I did. It's a book to slow down and read from time to time. "
846,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33537328-gheorghina,5,"This is one of the best books I have read. And for sure it is one that I will return to. I would just like to be able to memorize it all.The insight of making us understand how the human mind works and why we make some choices, is just brilliant.The only regret I have is that even if you read and understand things， the way our brain is wired， its software， can not be easily changed. This means that even if you are aware of things， it does not mean you are not susceptible for falling into traps. I cannot copy here the entire book content， but I will give an example:<“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion”. Moses took no animals into the ark;Noah did. The Moses illusion is explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context， and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him， but the mention of his name is not surprising. It also helps that Moses and Noah have the same vowel sound and number of syllables， so you unconsciously detect associative coherence between “Moses” and “ark” and so quickly accept the question. Replace Moses with George W Bush in this sentence and you will have a poor political joke but no illusion.>"
847,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16459651-allie,1,"This book was repetitive and tedious. I had to read it for a course, and I would definitely not have bothered otherwise. Within the first part of this book you've experienced all there is to experience. Kahneman goes through this book repeating the same theories in different ways again and again. Every now and then there will be a brief interlude of him bragging about his Nobel Prize or some other research he did that doesn't fully apply. This book got off to quite a bad start with me as it is 100% directed at Americans. I felt like many of the examples just confused the points more as they were based on knowledge that I, as an Australian, do not have just generally. He also frequently gives an example of an effect and then says ""You thought this"". A majority of the time though I did not think what he claimed, making me frustrated at the writing and the theory he then presented. I feel like this book was very much a cocky piece of writing in which the author frequently claimed that as a population we're pretty stupid. I can understand this was not his intention, but it came across that way. If you do want to read this book, I suggest a brief skimming of the conclusions section in the back. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. "
848,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7541671-ariadna73,5,Here is my comment in Spanish: http://bit.ly/XhWvoUDaniel Kahneman is a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. Curiously; he only devotes one chapter of this book to his field of expertise (but it is a heck of a chapter; I tell ya) He explains how our brains think in two ways: slow and fast. Our fast brain help us make quick decisions so we don't get ran over by cars or hit by balls; or stand up for days on the supermarket isles deciding which product to buy. The second system thinks more slowly and that is the one that help us make the most important decisions in our lives like to whom we will get married and for whom we should work. Well; those two systems trend to interact and screw up each other; so this is why the world is so screwed up. The book is pretty scientific; and dense. I understood probably a third of it; but I liked chap. 1 and the conclussions; and I honestly tried the statistics one (chap 3;4) and the economics ones (5); but as I said it was difficult. I think this book would be very good as an object of study in specialized classes. I really liked it. I gave it 9 weeks of my time. It is really good.
849,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16430203-swaroop,4,"This is a great book to read for anyone with a passing interest in behavioral economics. It's significantly more detailed and scientific than other pop-science books in the genre by Malcolm Gladwell et al.You can break up the book into 3 parts.In the first part, he dismantles the rational choice theory. Kahneman says he is not out to dismantle classical economic theory, according to him, he is not questioning the rational agent theory, he is just establishing that humans are not rational agents. (Cool story bro.)He then proceeds to dismantle another popular assumption, that humans always try to maximize utility. The third part of the book, about the 'science of happiness' was easily the least interesting part of the book. Coincidentally, this part of the book comprises mostly of work done after Tversky's death. My biggest problem with this book and many other books of this genre is the constant repetition. Frankly, this book is much better than others in this respect. That only speaks to how absurd other books are.This was a fantastic read but I think I am done with books like this for a while."

I had put this book down when I was younger and determined to take up this challenge for myself, I decided to read 50 pages per day years later. And I completed it within a month! Undoubtedly, my most difficult and yet enriching, it almost felt like attending economics classes and feeling doubly intelligent while reading this one. Daniel Kahneman is a Genius...He talks about how our mind processes things, how judgements happen and why we jump to conclusions, why we always chose the easy way to do things, risk luck and intuition and many more theories. ..Don’t buy this one if you’re looking for an easy-breezy read, but if you’re willing to dive into making your brain take the harder way into understanding these concepts, on Economics and Behavioural Psychology with interesting case studies, don’t miss this one written by a Nobel Laureate ⭐️"

I had initially dismissed this book without reading it, thinking it would be about business/economics (I’d blame it on the blurb found on the cover, something from the author of Freakonomics). I read it because I found out it’s a pretty famous book on Goodreads.com I enjoyed parts of the book; I’d say 3/5th of it. I had skimmed through mostly the rest of it as it was too technical. The book is a very deep and technical study (as far as I’m concerned) on behavioural sciences and economics. But whatever I did read, it was excellent. The use of examples and sample question scenarios helped in understanding how the brain works and how & why we think the way we think. It is not a light read; it required me to sit up and actively understand it. Not really my type of a book, and I probably wouldn’t want to read anything similar. "

Although I appreciate the detail in which the author goes into, at times it was a bit much for me, which made it a sluggish read at times.I did like how Kahneman, to demonstrate concepts, asks you questions or has you look at pictures, and then explains what was occurring in your mind during that exercise.

856,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman“Thinking, Fast and Slow” is a fascinating look at how the mind works. Drawing on knowledge acquired from years of research in cognitive and social psychology, Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Daniel Kahneman delivers his magnum opus on Behavioral Economics. This excellent book focuses on the three key sets of distinctions: between the automatic System 1 and the effortful System 2, between the conception of agents in classical economics and in behavioral economics, and between the experiencing and the remembering selves. This enlightening 512-page book is composed of thirty-eight chapters and broken out by the following five Parts: Part I. Two Systems, Part II. Heuristics and Biases, Part III. Overconfidence, Part IV. Choices, and Part V. Two Selves.Positives:1.	Award-winning research. A masterpiece of behavioral economics knowledge. Overall accessible.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of a master. How the mind works. The biases of intuition, judgment, and decision making. 3.	Excellent format. Each chapter is well laid out and ends with a Speaking of section that summarizes the content via quotes.4.	A great job of defining and summarizing new terms. ""In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."" 5.	Supports findings with countless research. Provides many accessible and practical examples that help readers understand the insightful conclusions.6.	A great job of letting us what we know and to what degree. ""It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work.""7.	You are guaranteed to learn something. Countless tidbits of knowledge throughout this insightful book and how it applies to the read world. ""The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.""8.	The differences of Systems 1 and 2 and how they function with one another. ""System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."" ""System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.""9.	Important recurring concepts like WYSIATI (What You See Is All There IS). ""You surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle.""10.	Understanding heuristics and biases. ""The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.""11.	Paradoxical results for your enjoyment. ""People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it.""12.	Understanding how our brains work, ""The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.""13.	Wisdom. ""'Risk' does not exist 'out there,' independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as 'real risk' or 'objective risk.'"" Bonus. ""To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.""14.	You will learn lessons that are practical. ""Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.""15.	An interesting look at overconfidence. ""Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."" ""Remember this rule: intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.""16.	Have you ever had to plan anything in your life? Meet the planning fallacy. ""This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an “outside view” and is the cure to the planning fallacy.""17.	A very interesting look at Econs and Humans. ""Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices.""18.	 Prospect theory explained. ""The pain of losing $900 is more than 90% of the pain of losing $1,000. These two insights are the essence of prospect theory.""19.	Avoiding poor psychology. ""The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty. The expectation principle, by which values are weighted by their probability, is poor psychology.""20.	Great stuff on well being. 21.	An excellent Conclusions chapter that ties the book up comprehensively.Negatives:1.	Notes not linked up.2.	No formal separate bibliography.3.	Requires an investment of time. Thankfully, the book is worthy of your time.4.	The book overall is very well-written and accessible but some topics are challenging. 5.	Wanted more clarification on how Bayes's rules work.In summary, a masterpiece on behavioral economics. Dr. Kahneman shares his years of research and provides readers with an education on how the mind works. It requires an investment of your time but it so well worth it.

858,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41549696-jennifer-malinowski,4,"Very long book (the audiobook seemed to drag on interminably at times) describing Kahneman's premise that people have two different strategies for decision-making, called System 1 and System 2 (Fast and Slow). Overall, I think the book is a decent introduction for someone who is interested in why we make the choices we do, who doesn't already have a grasp of the theories or recently published studies in psychology and economics. That said, if you do, I don't think you'd find this book as interesting or helpful in extending your knowledge. Though by no means an expert in either, I have followed both fields, particularly where they intersect and have to do with consumer decision-making, and subsequently felt the book dragged on in parts and at times, even felt a little dated.Overall, a very solid 4* read. "
859,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009217-jonathan-donihue,5,"First off, I just want to say that this was one of the most arduous reading experiences of my life. ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is an amazing book, but it's not a casual read. That being said, I think it's one of the most important books of our time.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is a book about how we, as humans, make decisions. The author, Daniel Kahneman is an Economist and Nobel Laureate who has spent a lifetime (he's 82 years old) studying why we make stupid decisions. Alright, that's actually a bit simplistic. He and his partner, Amos Tversky, spent their entire careers studying how we decide things.In this book, Kahneman asks us to imagine that our minds are actually two distinct beings - beings that he (and other economists and psychologists) refer to as 'System 1' and 'System 2'. ""... I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make."" - Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 13). I would describe the 'two agents' as follows: System 1 is intuitive, emotional, artistic, imaginative, creative, spontaneous, forgetful, vain, superstitious, illogical, and capricious. System 2 is logical, deliberative, suspicious, wary, calculating, practical, attentive, just, predictable, and (unfortunately) indolent.Now, when you think about it, this internal dynamic is not really a new discovery. The innate dichotomy of the human mind has been a source of introspection, conversation, speculation, and proselytization for thousands of years. What makes this book different than the rest, though, is the lack of condemnation of either of the Systems of thought. Instead of venerating one and vilifying the other, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" focuses on the dynamic between the two systems of thought and shows how, if we understand and accept ourselves fully, we can make full use of the best aspects of our two selves and avoid the less desirable aspects.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is full to the brim with statistics and survey results and laborious studies and quotes from esoteric scientific papers. As such, I found it a very challenging read. Nonetheless, in spite of the difficult subject matter, Kahneman is able to keep it real. Real world anecdotes and easy to imagine thought experiments are woven into the narrative to help the lay person (like me) to more fully grok the subject matter. Additionally, each chapter sticks to one topic and ends with a summery that's designed to help the reader remember what was covered and to provide some simple ways that we can use the chapters lessons in our everyday lives. Theses summaries take the form ""Speaking of........) Here are some examples from the book:Chapter 1 - Speaking of System 1 and System 2 “He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.” “This was a pure System 1 response. She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.” “This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.”Chapter 5 -Speaking of Cognitive Ease""Let's not dismiss their business plan just because the font makes it hard to read.""""We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but let's think it through again.""""Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.""""I'm in a good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.""Chapter 36 - Speaking of Life as a Story “He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.” “The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.” “You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?” “She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”Chapter 37 - Speaking of Experienced Well-Being “The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.” “The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?” “Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.”Although the author didn't say anything in the book about spiritual growth, from my perspective, the entire book was a textbook on the subject of self mastery. I believe that it could be used in combination with specifically adapted meditation practices and lifestyle changes as primary source-book for a serious spiritual development class or group."
860,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57346995-lexy,3,I thought that this book was okay 
861,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9485245-prashant,5,"Thinking fast and slow is a book that came along in 2011 though I still feel that it’s one of the most relevant and important books of its times. Personally, for me, it’s one of those books where every time you read it, you are able to learn something new.Though there is a caveat: This is a book which will scare you the moment you will pick it, as it's a heavy book to read, though if you can fight back and finish the first 100 pages then I can assure you that the writing of Daniel Kanheman will be able to keep you intrigued in the book until you finish it. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.  Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Though we do need to talk a little about the author as well i.e. Daniel Kahneman, is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is seen by many as one of the world’s most important thinkers. So, If you are thinking, I am in sales and how would this book help in my subject then for your surprise, his research influences our daily lives in a big way, for example, he gives an example of a situation in which people who are risk-averse, becomes risky and vice versa. He helps us understand, how our minds work in perceiving a statement and how it influences our decisions. If you are feeling that I have a boring, normal job then why should I read this book- then it could help you understand when we should approach people to get a decision in our favor i.e. you should approach your boss for raise when his tummy is full and he is happy as that’s the time when people actually put their guards down and use their intuitions more than their brains.If you are a stock-broker then it gives the perfect advice to not follow your stocks on a regular basis and looking them only once a quarter to generate better returns. There are so many words of wisdom in this book that it’s difficult for me to capture all over here and I can assure you that it’s tougher to implement those in your life, ergo, I have decided to read this book every year and I feel that it’s definitely not a bad decision. The last section of the book explores the contrasting ‘selves’ embodied in every individual: the remembering self and the experiencing self. The remembering self refers to the aspect in our nature that evaluates episodes by the lasting memory they leave; the one that keeps track of goals and keeps mental accounts; that answers the question: how satisfied are you with your life? The experiencing self is the aspect that feels every moment; that evaluates pleasure and pain on the go. Interestingly, these two selves are in conflict. The remembering self overweights the end of an episode and is indifferent to duration; it often promotes actions based on the memory that will result. Paradoxically, people may prefer an experience that is more painful in aggregate sum than another simply as a result of it ending on a less painful note.Kahneman concludes that both selves are necessary for evaluating subjective wellbeing, as both give us important information. Focusing exclusively on one or the other therefore excludes an important aspect of wellbeing.This book succeeds in instilling an awareness of the many biases and heuristics that lead to errors of judgments and poor decision-making. Above all, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a highly enjoyable and informative read for anyone wanting an insight into the human mind. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."

Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."

I did not know our thoughts could be so contradictory!I definitely did not take the right type of notes while reading this book to best navigate how I will think in the future... would love to hear how others have internalized their lessons learned.
864,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,4,"Daniel Kahneman was one of my professor's phd advisor at Princeton, and you can tell. Before reading this book I had a chance to be part of all these tiny experiments and see on my own mind where I have a bias and where I naturally tend to use ""system 2"" for my own good. Like everyone else, I have my goods and bads too, and this book does a very good job to explain *why* one might respond in a particular way to a question, but I have no idea how to correct them besides trying hard to be careful - which contradicts the definition of a bias really, so maybe they're not fixable. Having been through many of the experiments in this book (as well as the ones in Choices, values & frames, which I plan to read as well soon), I'm now really glad that I postponed reading this by two years! (The size was initially overwhelming, but it turned out to be a very casual read)The book feels very cozy after having been through the experiments, but it's great nevertheless, regardless of this practical stuff. I do wish that more of those posting on fb 10 strong opinions on 10 different subjects / day would read it too :)Some of my favorite quotes:In 1955, as a twenty-one-year-old lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces, I was assigned to set up an interview system for the entire army. If you wonder why such a responsibility would be forced upon someone so young, bear in mind that the state of Israel itself was only seven years old at the time.Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgement is missing - what we see is all there is. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. [...] Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.""How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?"" The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the ""Moses illusion"". Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did."
865,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is a book I'm more glad I have read than I actually enjoyed reading it. My favorite passage, incidentally, came in the introduction, when the author describes his working relationship with a close collaborator and which I identified with strongly. Several other points I took away are as follows:--the difference between thinking actively and passively, and particularly, that active thinking affects behavior in other ways (making people more selfish, superficial, and sexist). I identify with this based on how people perceive me when I'm exceptionally busy.--the concept of ""what you see is all there is,"" and particularly of priming effects, and implicit influence of what's in front of you. (My boss seems especially vulnerable to this!) As well this makes me rededicate myself to the theory that you should hire people based on their resumes rather than interviews; or at the very least employ your judgment only after scoring candidates (or other things, it's relevant more broadly) on more objective metrics--a valuable construct in business, to postulate how things could go wrong, as a method to avoid groupthink, encourage creative thinking, and make sure opposing ideas are heard--the difference in risk aversion with respect to gains and losses...not taking good gambles, and preferring risky gambles to limit losses. The author points out that most people avoid this pitfall when the games are presented as one they would play multiple times, but also highlight that in life, any gamble is almost certainly one of many. However, despite this interesting research, I found this book rather dry, and I read almost exclusively non-fiction. As well, the author's many references to the influence of his work, his Nobel Prize, etc., grew old by the end. The format, of repeating the research results in several different ways, with somewhat cheesy examples at the end of each chapter, was a bit didactic for me. But I did learn a good amount. "

We could call this a bias, I suppose. Some primal part of my mind gets bathed in hunger hormones and such, and it makes me do things I shouldn't be doing, and those things would make me fat, so I learned to control this hellish urge, and whenever I do the groceries hungry, I remind myself of this fact. Whenever I start a meal really hungry I pick less food than what my eyes desire, and even gulp down a glass of water in order to ease my sense of hunger a bit.Why do I tell you this?Because some reviewers have said that it's useless to read about our mental short circuits, because we can't possibly do anything about them.Wrong. We can!Identifying your biases and intellectual pitfalls is the first step to combating them.Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about much more nuanced, and much less obvious circuits of thinking, and boy, it talks about a lot of them. I fancy myself a skeptic, a scientist, a student of thinking, so I've already known about most of the topics this book touches, and while it is not a complete list of all our intellectual quirks, IT TOOK ME YEARS to learn about the ones found in the book. So dear potential reader, you are lucky, because thanks to this wonderful book, you get to learn about them in the space of a lazy weekend (499 pages).Whether you are a big time corporate fatcat, a teacher, or a soccer mom, you'll benefit greatly from keeping at least some of Kahneman's conclusions in mind, because you are human, and we humans need to learn how to think, because we tend to make all sorts of mistakes."
867,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013427-laura,4,"A groundbreaking book on the pitfalls of subconscious thought. Thinking, Fast and Slow is the product of new (at the time) research on quick, mostly subconscious, intuitive thought and deliberate, logical thought. The major insight from this book is the many, many ways that the intuition can be misled and provide one with faulty conclusions. This insight was most applicable to me as I consider my role on a book acquisition committee, as my team meets regularly to collectively decide which book proposals to accept and reject. There is immense potential for intuitive factors to weigh largely in these decisions as we make a long series of important decisions carefully but with necessary time restrictions. I strongly advise anyone in similar decision-making situations to read this book, or another book on this topic. It will give you good tools for careful thinking and for helping others avoid unwarranted conclusions. One reason you might choose not to read this book is that it is quite long and dedicates too much space to describing his research methodology. I would also have preferred more discussion of ways that a well-developed intuition can be an asset (though Kahnneman appropriately points out that awareness of intuition pitfalls can, over time, lead to better intuition). Another book I've read, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do does this well and would be a good companion or follow-up to this book."

Most of the books I give 4-star reviews to are well written and interesting, but not important per se, like Harry Potter or David McCulluogh's book on the building of the Panama Canal. No matter how good those books are, they're not exactly life changing. Thinking, Fast and Slow is well written and quite interesting, but beyond that I think it's an important book because it explains so much about how we think, why we make the choices we make, and how we can make better choices as well as help others to make better choices. As I read it I found myself thinking I need to read this about 10 times and take notes about how to apply it to my business, my family, and my other relationships. There is just so much useful stuff in the book. I could use it to change the language I use on my business website, I could use it to change how I communicate with my children, and I could use it to change how I interact with my spouse. There is so much knowledge packed into this, and I especially appreciate how, at the end of each chapter, Kahneman gives a few 1-2 sentence practical examples of how his research can be used in the real world."
869,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre,3,"I bought the audiobook for this after a reviewer of Chuck Klosterman's latest book drew a parallel with THINKING, FAST AND SLOW and OF COURSE both books have nothing to do with one another. How do I keep getting suckered into reading these books about cognitive biases and heuristics, I do not know. This one's pretty well made though and exposes a theory of two thought system: an intuitive one that takes instant decisions (like putting pants on in the morning) and hardwired to create coherence out of everything. It is this brain that scares people watching horror movies. There is also the second thought system that can very well override the first, which leads to conscious cognition. So that's cool and it's very enlightening to learn how to differentiate the two in your daily reactions.The book can't transcend its nature though as it plays it safe with its own scientific angle and ends up being just a list of situations where heuristics are involved. There are a lot of books like this available on the market albeit it is quite well done. It can get mind-numbing after a while and especially if you read the audiobook version like I did. Wanted to throw myself off a cliff after 15 or so hours."

I had put this in my every year to-read-list for 3 consecutive years and the hope of finishing it had been thin. This time last year I picked up Leonardo da Vinci and it dragged on for 6 months. I learned a valuable lesson from then on, that’s it’s okay to have an affair with books. While reading this book, I've swept through a whole YA Fantasy series and even started another book. What kept me afloat was a simple rule, I only had to read this book 1 hour every day, then I could be off to read whatever I want. There were days my will power was too low that I might give myself a break by immersing on a romance novel and come back fresher the next day.   2 months came by like a rush, and now I feel sorry this book ended so soon.    Why do we need to read this book when we can read a summary version of it online and eagerly tell anyone who asks that this book was a-okay? Because you read to understand. Only when you can summarise this book from your own understanding of it can you know that it will stick with you and be of help in your life for a long time. Please do not read this if you have no interest in human behaviors, you do not really care why we do what we do, or how we make mistakes, how we come up with decisions. That time can be well spent doing many things else but reading Thinking, Fast and SlowHowever if you need to understand this fast for work or any project, you can read 2 of the authors’ researches that built up this book, then start reading the book when you feel up for the commitment.And now the question is, when will I finish Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder? "
871,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"My favorite passage: ""When I asked my large undergraduate class in some indignation, 'Do you realize that you have violated an elementary logical rule?' someone in the back row shouted, 'So what?'"" (p.158).Most relevant for me were the many examples of the striking differences in between subjects and within subjects experiments. So, for example, when subjects were asked to judge the value of the following sets of dinnerware presented together, they judged set A as more valuable:SET A: 40 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good condition8 cups, 2 of them broken8 saucers, 7 of them brokenSET B: 24 pieces8 dinner plates in good condition8 soup/salad bowls in good condition8 dessert plates in good conditionBut when subjects saw only one or the other of the two sets, they judged SET B to be worth more than SET A. Why? When presented with the sets together, they could make a comparative judgment and see that SET A contained more items in good shape than set B. But seen individually, they make a snap judgment of average value of the items in the set, which is higher in SET B than in SET A. I couldn't help but think about the relevance of this idea when you're putting your CV together. Say there are two candidates for a job. Candidate A has two publications in really good journals. Candidate B has two publications in equally good journals, and also two publications in unrefereed conference proceedings or journals edited by her friends. Considered side by side, maybe Candidate B has a slight advantage over A, but considered individually, Candidate A looks better. The average level of her publications is higher than B's. Maybe I should prune my list of conference presentations in light of this finding.Kahneman says (p.354) that ""We normally experience life in the between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might change your mind are absent..."" and that in making decisions we should encourage consideration of ""broad context"", which includes alternatives (p.361). This is clearly relevant to debates about contextualism and invariantism, conversational context, and the standard linguistic methodology of eliciting intuitions from subjects about individual cases isolated from contrasting cases.

Maybe it's my problem. Maybe I just think differently. I suspect this book is written for left brained thinkers. I am very much a right brained thinker. Consequently, the author would pose a problem, assume the reader came to a certain conclusion, then built his thesis on the conclusion he assumes the reader arrived at. The problem was I never I arrived at his preconceived conclusions. Maybe because he assumes our brains all work a certain way. Ironic at that.Here's some examples. He gives a problem and tells us not to try to solve it but listen to our intuition:A ball and a bat cost $1.10The bat cost one dollar more than the bat.How much does the ball cost?Then he goes on to explain that the number that came to our mind was 10 cents because the ""distinctive mark of an easy puzzle is intuitive, appealing and wrong."" Then he informs us that the actual cost of the ball is 5 cents.But that is not how I read the problem. And since I didn't know where he was going with the puzzle, I assumed he was testing our ability to catch logical fallacies.When the statement said a ball and a bat cost $1.10, I assumed that he meant they EACH cost $1.10. After all he did not say the sum of the cost or that ""together"" they cost. I then went on to conclude the next two sentences were wrong.So does that make me stupid?Here's another one: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?According to the author the answer is determined whether the reader will remember that Detroit is in Michigan.OK. But the question was not whether Michigan has a high rate of murders, or higher than other states. The question was what number of murders occur in Michigan. Isn't that what ""how many murders"" means?My answer was, how the heck do I know the number of murders that occur anywhere without consulting a reliable census source?Needless to say I found this book frustrating and not a very reliable source for learning about cognitive functions."
873,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,5,"Finishing this book means I completed my 2017 Reading Challenge here on Goodreads. It also means I finished a book that I bought in 2015 ""because it was a book one ought to read"". I couldn't voluntarily take it off the shelf to read. What got me to read and finish and enjoy this book was reading it with some colleagues at work. The issue came up during a training class - I actually do not remember how - and several of us decided that we would read a section of the book every two weeks. There were five sections so we would finish in approximately 10 weeks. This way, there was room for busy events at work that could keep us from reading or the events of our own lives. The period of two weeks wasn't too long so that fast readers would get impatient or bored, or that anyone would forget anything. We met for only 30 minutes - either during lunch or a short time after where we each stated one thing we liked and one thing we disliked, after which we could have a free discussion. Stating one thing we liked or disliked was merely a device for ensuring all could be heard and to try to structure our thoughts in the short time frame.It worked. But I am not finished with the book. Oh yes, I read the book. However, this is not a quick read that you put back on the shelf and ignore. There are some heavy-duty thoughts in here that I, for one, will need to lean on for a long time when referencing points during a discussion. Also, some parts were a little over my head - I haven't studied probability so I lacked the vocabulary to grasp those areas well. However, to Kahneman's praise, his writing meant that I could plow through those bits and still get his point.I have already been recommending this book to others. While carrying it around at work for our meetings, some people I knew would say ""oh, excellent book"", so it almost became a secret handshake. :)All in all, I had a good experience reading and digesting this book. :)"
874,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"If you want to read a layman's introduction into the psychology of decision making, Kahneman's book is probably the best. Dan Ariely has written similar books, but his are kind of jokey, lightweight, and unnuanced. Thinking, Fast and Slow is unlike most bestsellers in that it assumes the reader is intelligent and isn't on the beach or skimming. It's not particularly engaging - Kahneman's writing is on the dry and pedantic side - but this book is carefully written, and packed with fifty years of work in the field of decision making. While of course Kahneman tends to focus on his own research, he is very generous in citing and lauding the work of others. In a lot of ways, this book is a very impressive achievement.Unlike Ariely, Kahneman doesn't emphasize the follies in the way our brain works. Rather he very simply, plainly, and convincingly shows how we as humans tend to go from point A to point B in our thinking. The examples he uses are very easy to grasp if you are a careful reader. I'd say, using the parlance of Kahneman, that if you have a well developed System 2 - patience and a love of slow thinking - and an interest in how humans think you'll enjoy this book. It's probably also true that the kind of person who'll find Thinking, Fast and Slow interesting will consistently find that he or she is in the minority population in the examples cited. At least that's what I found. If Kahneman says something like 84 percent will say A and 16 percent will say B in response to a question, I'll be in the 16 percent. Finding myself consistently in the minority was an illuminating thing, actually. I've always ascribed my tendency for oddball thinking to my strange background of growing up around war survivors and Hassidic Jews. Nope. Now I realize that I'm just a System 2 kind of guy."
875,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"4Thinking, Fast and Slow for the better part is a solid and interesting read. My central complaint is the repetitive later sections of the book. Apart from that this is a must-read book for everybody. Understanding the way you think is worth the early chapters, and it's quite a simplistic design for consumption. It does get heavy in the latter half of the book, and to be honest I was quite bored here myself. But, make no mistake, Daniel Kahneman has created something unique and informative. The structure of the book was interesting, with the common stage 1 & 2 mapped throughout. I will say this, you won't finish the book and not understand these two meanings. There feels like a repeat of information here, but there is a lot to digest. I quite liked the idea of the book and I think structurally it's okay. Some of the information should've been condensed at times, but more might be something the majority of readers wanted. I enjoy reading books like this to understand the why. This book explains so much and that's why I continued to read and finish it. Why the 4?I can understand why certain reviews have marked it tedious. I get that. I did found it tough to read in that final 100 pages, but I was more engaged with finishing and information overload. This is a good book. The author has thrown in so much, so in hindsight I would recommend slowly digesting if you're allowed. That comment is more to the owner of the book, the library reader has to make the call based on the amount of people in the waiting list. I discovered a lot here, and as creatures of habit, you will notice these examples day after day. You can't unread what you've learned. I recommend reading this and not force reading it like I did. It's a book to slow down and read from time to time. "

I would just like to be able to memorize it all.The insight of making us understand how the human mind works and why we make some choices, is just brilliant.The only regret I have is that even if you read and understand things， the way our brain is wired， its software， can not be easily changed. This means that even if you are aware of things， it does not mean you are not susceptible for falling into traps. I cannot copy here the entire book content， but I will give an example:<“How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?” The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the “Moses illusion”. Moses took no animals into the ark;Noah did. The Moses illusion is explained by norm theory. The idea of animals going into the ark sets up a biblical context， and Moses is not abnormal in that context. You did not positively expect him， but the mention of his name is not surprising. It also helps that Moses and Noah have the same vowel sound and number of syllables， so you unconsciously detect associative coherence between “Moses” and “ark” and so quickly accept the question. Replace Moses with George W Bush in this sentence and you will have a poor political joke but no illusion.>"

Within the first part of this book you've experienced all there is to experience. Kahneman goes through this book repeating the same theories in different ways again and again. Every now and then there will be a brief interlude of him bragging about his Nobel Prize or some other research he did that doesn't fully apply. This book got off to quite a bad start with me as it is 100% directed at Americans. I felt like many of the examples just confused the points more as they were based on knowledge that I, as an Australian, do not have just generally. He also frequently gives an example of an effect and then says ""You thought this"". A majority of the time though I did not think what he claimed, making me frustrated at the writing and the theory he then presented. I feel like this book was very much a cocky piece of writing in which the author frequently claimed that as a population we're pretty stupid. I can understand this was not his intention, but it came across that way. If you do want to read this book, I suggest a brief skimming of the conclusions section in the back. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. "

Curiously; he only devotes one chapter of this book to his field of expertise (but it is a heck of a chapter; I tell ya) He explains how our brains think in two ways: slow and fast. Our fast brain help us make quick decisions so we don't get ran over by cars or hit by balls; or stand up for days on the supermarket isles deciding which product to buy. The second system thinks more slowly and that is the one that help us make the most important decisions in our lives like to whom we will get married and for whom we should work. Well; those two systems trend to interact and screw up each other; so this is why the world is so screwed up. The book is pretty scientific; and dense. I understood probably a third of it; but I liked chap. 1 and the conclussions; and I honestly tried the statistics one (chap 3;4) and the economics ones (5); but as I said it was difficult. I think this book would be very good as an object of study in specialized classes. I really liked it. I gave it 9 weeks of my time. It is really good.

It's significantly more detailed and scientific than other pop-science books in the genre by Malcolm Gladwell et al.You can break up the book into 3 parts.In the first part, he dismantles the rational choice theory. Kahneman says he is not out to dismantle classical economic theory, according to him, he is not questioning the rational agent theory, he is just establishing that humans are not rational agents. (Cool story bro.)He then proceeds to dismantle another popular assumption, that humans always try to maximize utility. The third part of the book, about the 'science of happiness' was easily the least interesting part of the book. Coincidentally, this part of the book comprises mostly of work done after Tversky's death. My biggest problem with this book and many other books of this genre is the constant repetition. Frankly, this book is much better than others in this respect. That only speaks to how absurd other books are.This was a fantastic read but I think I am done with books like this for a while."

Undoubtedly, my most difficult and yet enriching, it almost felt like attending economics classes and feeling doubly intelligent while reading this one. Daniel Kahneman is a Genius...He talks about how our mind processes things, how judgements happen and why we jump to conclusions, why we always chose the easy way to do things, risk luck and intuition and many more theories. ..Don’t buy this one if you’re looking for an easy-breezy read, but if you’re willing to dive into making your brain take the harder way into understanding these concepts, on Economics and Behavioural Psychology with interesting case studies, don’t miss this one written by a Nobel Laureate ⭐️"

I read it because I found out it’s a pretty famous book on Goodreads.com I enjoyed parts of the book; I’d say 3/5th of it. I had skimmed through mostly the rest of it as it was too technical. The book is a very deep and technical study (as far as I’m concerned) on behavioural sciences and economics. But whatever I did read, it was excellent. The use of examples and sample question scenarios helped in understanding how the brain works and how & why we think the way we think.

Drawing on knowledge acquired from years of research in cognitive and social psychology, Nobel Prize Winner, Dr. Daniel Kahneman delivers his magnum opus on Behavioral Economics. This excellent book focuses on the three key sets of distinctions: between the automatic System 1 and the effortful System 2, between the conception of agents in classical economics and in behavioral economics, and between the experiencing and the remembering selves. This enlightening 512-page book is composed of thirty-eight chapters and broken out by the following five Parts: Part I. Two Systems, Part II. Heuristics and Biases, Part III. Overconfidence, Part IV. Choices, and Part V. Two Selves.Positives:1.	Award-winning research. A masterpiece of behavioral economics knowledge. Overall accessible.2.	Fascinating topic in the hands of a master. How the mind works. The biases of intuition, judgment, and decision making. 3.	Excellent format. Each chapter is well laid out and ends with a Speaking of section that summarizes the content via quotes.4.	A great job of defining and summarizing new terms. ""In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."" 5.	Supports findings with countless research. Provides many accessible and practical examples that help readers understand the insightful conclusions.6.	A great job of letting us what we know and to what degree. ""It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work.""7.	You are guaranteed to learn something. Countless tidbits of knowledge throughout this insightful book and how it applies to the read world. ""The best possible account of the data provides bad news: tired and hungry judges tend to fall back on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. Both fatigue and hunger probably play a role.""8.	The differences of Systems 1 and 2 and how they function with one another. ""System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."" ""System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.""9.	Important recurring concepts like WYSIATI (What You See Is All There IS). ""You surely understand in principle that worthless information should not be treated differently from a complete lack of information, but WYSIATI makes it very difficult to apply that principle.""10.	Understanding heuristics and biases. ""The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.""11.	Paradoxical results for your enjoyment. ""People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it.""12.	Understanding how our brains work, ""The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.""13.	Wisdom. ""'Risk' does not exist 'out there,' independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as 'real risk' or 'objective risk.'"" Bonus. ""To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability.""14.	You will learn lessons that are practical. ""Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.""15.	An interesting look at overconfidence. ""Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."" ""Remember this rule: intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment.""16.	Have you ever had to plan anything in your life? Meet the planning fallacy. ""This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an “outside view” and is the cure to the planning fallacy.""17.	A very interesting look at Econs and Humans. ""Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices.""18.	 Prospect theory explained.

""The conclusion is straightforward: the decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes, contrary to the expectation principle. Improbable outcomes are overweighted—this is the possibility effect. Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty.

An excellent Conclusions chapter that ties the book up comprehensively.Negatives:1.	Notes not linked up.2.	No formal separate bibliography.3.	Requires an investment of time. Thankfully, the book is worthy of your time.4.	The book overall is very well-written and accessible but some topics are challenging. 5.	Wanted more clarification on how Bayes's rules work.In summary, a masterpiece on behavioral economics. Dr. Kahneman shares his years of research and provides readers with an education on how the mind works. It requires an investment of your time but it so well worth it.

Book is flooded with exceptional insights of how our brain works on these two modes. These  evolutionary adapted system works friend and foe. People make guesses based on a anchor value given, with no correlation in between. Why we simply neglect base rate when we make guesses or predication. How mind is able to construct a whole story with very little information available. We certainly understand less about the past, so is our future. why should be vary when consistent patterns success emerge. why even better stock predictors as themselves call them no better than random chimpanzees. Do you know something about 'cost sunk fallacy'. You will learn about your surprising brain and it absolute jewels of insight from this book, which apparently paved new branch in economics called behavioral economics, earned Nobel prize for Kahneman and Amorsky.Wonderful book never to be missed. "
888,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41549696-jennifer-malinowski,4,"Very long book (the audiobook seemed to drag on interminably at times) describing Kahneman's premise that people have two different strategies for decision-making, called System 1 and System 2 (Fast and Slow). Overall, I think the book is a decent introduction for someone who is interested in why we make the choices we do, who doesn't already have a grasp of the theories or recently published studies in psychology and economics. That said, if you do, I don't think you'd find this book as interesting or helpful in extending your knowledge. Though by no means an expert in either, I have followed both fields, particularly where they intersect and have to do with consumer decision-making, and subsequently felt the book dragged on in parts and at times, even felt a little dated.Overall, a very solid 4* read. "
889,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009217-jonathan-donihue,5,"First off, I just want to say that this was one of the most arduous reading experiences of my life. ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is an amazing book, but it's not a casual read. That being said, I think it's one of the most important books of our time.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is a book about how we, as humans, make decisions. The author, Daniel Kahneman is an Economist and Nobel Laureate who has spent a lifetime (he's 82 years old) studying why we make stupid decisions. Alright, that's actually a bit simplistic. He and his partner, Amos Tversky, spent their entire careers studying how we decide things.In this book, Kahneman asks us to imagine that our minds are actually two distinct beings - beings that he (and other economists and psychologists) refer to as 'System 1' and 'System 2'. ""... I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind. In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make."" - Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 13). I would describe the 'two agents' as follows: System 1 is intuitive, emotional, artistic, imaginative, creative, spontaneous, forgetful, vain, superstitious, illogical, and capricious. System 2 is logical, deliberative, suspicious, wary, calculating, practical, attentive, just, predictable, and (unfortunately) indolent.Now, when you think about it, this internal dynamic is not really a new discovery. The innate dichotomy of the human mind has been a source of introspection, conversation, speculation, and proselytization for thousands of years. What makes this book different than the rest, though, is the lack of condemnation of either of the Systems of thought. Instead of venerating one and vilifying the other, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" focuses on the dynamic between the two systems of thought and shows how, if we understand and accept ourselves fully, we can make full use of the best aspects of our two selves and avoid the less desirable aspects.""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" is full to the brim with statistics and survey results and laborious studies and quotes from esoteric scientific papers. As such, I found it a very challenging read. Nonetheless, in spite of the difficult subject matter, Kahneman is able to keep it real. Real world anecdotes and easy to imagine thought experiments are woven into the narrative to help the lay person (like me) to more fully grok the subject matter. Additionally, each chapter sticks to one topic and ends with a summery that's designed to help the reader remember what was covered and to provide some simple ways that we can use the chapters lessons in our everyday lives. Theses summaries take the form ""Speaking of........) Here are some examples from the book:Chapter 1 - Speaking of System 1 and System 2 “He had an impression, but some of his impressions are illusions.” “This was a pure System 1 response. She reacted to the threat before she recognized it.” “This is your System 1 talking. Slow down and let your System 2 take control.”Chapter 5 -Speaking of Cognitive Ease""Let's not dismiss their business plan just because the font makes it hard to read.""""We must be inclined to believe it because it has been repeated so often, but let's think it through again.""""Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.""""I'm in a good mood today, and my System 2 is weaker than usual. I should be extra careful.""Chapter 36 - Speaking of Life as a Story “He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.” “The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter is a sign of total duration neglect.” “You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not very memorable?” “She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to beauty and gentleness.”Chapter 37 - Speaking of Experienced Well-Being “The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and extreme poverty should be a priority.” “The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?” “Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to enjoy the less expensive ones.”Although the author didn't say anything in the book about spiritual growth, from my perspective, the entire book was a textbook on the subject of self mastery. I believe that it could be used in combination with specifically adapted meditation practices and lifestyle changes as primary source-book for a serious spiritual development class or group."

891,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9485245-prashant,5,"Thinking fast and slow is a book that came along in 2011 though I still feel that it’s one of the most relevant and important books of its times. Personally, for me, it’s one of those books where every time you read it, you are able to learn something new.Though there is a caveat: This is a book which will scare you the moment you will pick it, as it's a heavy book to read, though if you can fight back and finish the first 100 pages then I can assure you that the writing of Daniel Kanheman will be able to keep you intrigued in the book until you finish it. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior.  Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Though we do need to talk a little about the author as well i.e. Daniel Kahneman, is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology challenging the rational model of judgment and decision making, is seen by many as one of the world’s most important thinkers. So, If you are thinking, I am in sales and how would this book help in my subject then for your surprise, his research influences our daily lives in a big way, for example, he gives an example of a situation in which people who are risk-averse, becomes risky and vice versa. He helps us understand, how our minds work in perceiving a statement and how it influences our decisions. If you are feeling that I have a boring, normal job then why should I read this book- then it could help you understand when we should approach people to get a decision in our favor i.e. you should approach your boss for raise when his tummy is full and he is happy as that’s the time when people actually put their guards down and use their intuitions more than their brains.If you are a stock-broker then it gives the perfect advice to not follow your stocks on a regular basis and looking them only once a quarter to generate better returns. There are so many words of wisdom in this book that it’s difficult for me to capture all over here and I can assure you that it’s tougher to implement those in your life, ergo, I have decided to read this book every year and I feel that it’s definitely not a bad decision. The last section of the book explores the contrasting ‘selves’ embodied in every individual: the remembering self and the experiencing self. The remembering self refers to the aspect in our nature that evaluates episodes by the lasting memory they leave; the one that keeps track of goals and keeps mental accounts; that answers the question: how satisfied are you with your life? The experiencing self is the aspect that feels every moment; that evaluates pleasure and pain on the go. Interestingly, these two selves are in conflict. The remembering self overweights the end of an episode and is indifferent to duration; it often promotes actions based on the memory that will result. Paradoxically, people may prefer an experience that is more painful in aggregate sum than another simply as a result of it ending on a less painful note.Kahneman concludes that both selves are necessary for evaluating subjective wellbeing, as both give us important information. Focusing exclusively on one or the other therefore excludes an important aspect of wellbeing.This book succeeds in instilling an awareness of the many biases and heuristics that lead to errors of judgments and poor decision-making. Above all, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a highly enjoyable and informative read for anyone wanting an insight into the human mind. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking."
892,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82596342-iman-shabani,5,"I still haven't read the whole book as most reviews mention the main topic could be said in a lot less pages without leaving out anything important, so I listened (and read) a couple of well-written summaries of it.However now that I'm done, and know what the book has to offer, I'm going to spend some more time on it and read it more thoroughly, maybe not very soon, considering its volume, but not-so-late either.I can recommend this book to you for sure, even if you're listening to only a summary of it. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."
893,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3279705-vivian-zhang,4,My goodness. I did not know our thoughts could be so contradictory!I definitely did not take the right type of notes while reading this book to best navigate how I will think in the future... would love to hear how others have internalized their lessons learned.
894,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,4,"Daniel Kahneman was one of my professor's phd advisor at Princeton, and you can tell. Before reading this book I had a chance to be part of all these tiny experiments and see on my own mind where I have a bias and where I naturally tend to use ""system 2"" for my own good. Like everyone else, I have my goods and bads too, and this book does a very good job to explain *why* one might respond in a particular way to a question, but I have no idea how to correct them besides trying hard to be careful - which contradicts the definition of a bias really, so maybe they're not fixable. Having been through many of the experiments in this book (as well as the ones in Choices, values & frames, which I plan to read as well soon), I'm now really glad that I postponed reading this by two years! (The size was initially overwhelming, but it turned out to be a very casual read)The book feels very cozy after having been through the experiments, but it's great nevertheless, regardless of this practical stuff. I do wish that more of those posting on fb 10 strong opinions on 10 different subjects / day would read it too :)Some of my favorite quotes:In 1955, as a twenty-one-year-old lieutenant in the Israeli Defense Forces, I was assigned to set up an interview system for the entire army. If you wonder why such a responsibility would be forced upon someone so young, bear in mind that the state of Israel itself was only seven years old at the time.Neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgement is missing - what we see is all there is. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. [...] Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.""How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?"" The number of people who detect what is wrong with this question is so small that it has been dubbed the ""Moses illusion"". Moses took no animals into the ark; Noah did."
895,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is a book I'm more glad I have read than I actually enjoyed reading it. My favorite passage, incidentally, came in the introduction, when the author describes his working relationship with a close collaborator and which I identified with strongly. Several other points I took away are as follows:--the difference between thinking actively and passively, and particularly, that active thinking affects behavior in other ways (making people more selfish, superficial, and sexist). I identify with this based on how people perceive me when I'm exceptionally busy.--the concept of ""what you see is all there is,"" and particularly of priming effects, and implicit influence of what's in front of you. (My boss seems especially vulnerable to this!) As well this makes me rededicate myself to the theory that you should hire people based on their resumes rather than interviews; or at the very least employ your judgment only after scoring candidates (or other things, it's relevant more broadly) on more objective metrics--a valuable construct in business, to postulate how things could go wrong, as a method to avoid groupthink, encourage creative thinking, and make sure opposing ideas are heard--the difference in risk aversion with respect to gains and losses...not taking good gambles, and preferring risky gambles to limit losses. The author points out that most people avoid this pitfall when the games are presented as one they would play multiple times, but also highlight that in life, any gamble is almost certainly one of many. However, despite this interesting research, I found this book rather dry, and I read almost exclusively non-fiction. As well, the author's many references to the influence of his work, his Nobel Prize, etc., grew old by the end. The format, of repeating the research results in several different ways, with somewhat cheesy examples at the end of each chapter, was a bit didactic for me. But I did learn a good amount. "
896,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8070622-adam-morva,5,"When I'm hungry I tend to make myself bigger servings of meals than I can comfortably eat, and I always want to buy more food and snacks in the supermarket than I need. We could call this a bias, I suppose. Some primal part of my mind gets bathed in hunger hormones and such, and it makes me do things I shouldn't be doing, and those things would make me fat, so I learned to control this hellish urge, and whenever I do the groceries hungry, I remind myself of this fact. Whenever I start a meal really hungry I pick less food than what my eyes desire, and even gulp down a glass of water in order to ease my sense of hunger a bit.Why do I tell you this?Because some reviewers have said that it's useless to read about our mental short circuits, because we can't possibly do anything about them.Wrong. We can!Identifying your biases and intellectual pitfalls is the first step to combating them.Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow talks about much more nuanced, and much less obvious circuits of thinking, and boy, it talks about a lot of them. I fancy myself a skeptic, a scientist, a student of thinking, so I've already known about most of the topics this book touches, and while it is not a complete list of all our intellectual quirks, IT TOOK ME YEARS to learn about the ones found in the book. So dear potential reader, you are lucky, because thanks to this wonderful book, you get to learn about them in the space of a lazy weekend (499 pages).Whether you are a big time corporate fatcat, a teacher, or a soccer mom, you'll benefit greatly from keeping at least some of Kahneman's conclusions in mind, because you are human, and we humans need to learn how to think, because we tend to make all sorts of mistakes."
897,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013427-laura,4,"A groundbreaking book on the pitfalls of subconscious thought. Thinking, Fast and Slow is the product of new (at the time) research on quick, mostly subconscious, intuitive thought and deliberate, logical thought. The major insight from this book is the many, many ways that the intuition can be misled and provide one with faulty conclusions. This insight was most applicable to me as I consider my role on a book acquisition committee, as my team meets regularly to collectively decide which book proposals to accept and reject. There is immense potential for intuitive factors to weigh largely in these decisions as we make a long series of important decisions carefully but with necessary time restrictions. I strongly advise anyone in similar decision-making situations to read this book, or another book on this topic. It will give you good tools for careful thinking and for helping others avoid unwarranted conclusions. One reason you might choose not to read this book is that it is quite long and dedicates too much space to describing his research methodology. I would also have preferred more discussion of ways that a well-developed intuition can be an asset (though Kahnneman appropriately points out that awareness of intuition pitfalls can, over time, lead to better intuition). Another book I've read, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do does this well and would be a good companion or follow-up to this book."
898,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4752106-josh-steimle,5,"I give 5-star reviews to books that I think are well written, fascinating, and important imo. Most of the books I give 4-star reviews to are well written and interesting, but not important per se, like Harry Potter or David McCulluogh's book on the building of the Panama Canal. No matter how good those books are, they're not exactly life changing. Thinking, Fast and Slow is well written and quite interesting, but beyond that I think it's an important book because it explains so much about how we think, why we make the choices we make, and how we can make better choices as well as help others to make better choices. As I read it I found myself thinking I need to read this about 10 times and take notes about how to apply it to my business, my family, and my other relationships. There is just so much useful stuff in the book. I could use it to change the language I use on my business website, I could use it to change how I communicate with my children, and I could use it to change how I interact with my spouse. There is so much knowledge packed into this, and I especially appreciate how, at the end of each chapter, Kahneman gives a few 1-2 sentence practical examples of how his research can be used in the real world."
899,0374275637,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre,3,"I bought the audiobook for this after a reviewer of Chuck Klosterman's latest book drew a parallel with THINKING, FAST AND SLOW and OF COURSE both books have nothing to do with one another. How do I keep getting suckered into reading these books about cognitive biases and heuristics, I do not know. This one's pretty well made though and exposes a theory of two thought system: an intuitive one that takes instant decisions (like putting pants on in the morning) and hardwired to create coherence out of everything. It is this brain that scares people watching horror movies. There is also the second thought system that can very well override the first, which leads to conscious cognition. So that's cool and it's very enlightening to learn how to differentiate the two in your daily reactions.The book can't transcend its nature though as it plays it safe with its own scientific angle and ends up being just a list of situations where heuristics are involved. There are a lot of books like this available on the market albeit it is quite well done. It can get mind-numbing after a while and especially if you read the audiobook version like I did. Wanted to throw myself off a cliff after 15 or so hours."
