0,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25493797-khurram,5,"A great book, by a great man. I had heard the name Steven Hawking, but never read any of his theories. Simply for the very reason the something coming from the smartest men of the previous 2 generations would be overly complicated and beyond my understanding. What I discovered in this book is Steven Hawking was just a great man as we was a scientist, but an incredible teacher as well. His method of writing allows people like, who have a passing interest in but only a vacation of his ability in science to understand his work. This skill cannot be understated as if the most knowledgeable person in the world cannot comuninate their knowledge it is list with them. Sort of like sending it into a black hole. The book is easily readable, Hawking' s dry wit and sense of humour makes reading and learning from it a pleasure. The metaphors on this book allowed me to grasp the basics of even the most complicated theories easily. Though I differ from him from a belief perspective, I do respect his ideas and I think like any great teacher Hawking would have welcomed this difference of opinion as a show of curiosity towards finding the truth.I am sure his views, and more in-depth theories will go a long way towards solving many of the great world wide problems highlighted in this book that we face today.I would recommend this book to any. It is a great read, and I don't thing anyone can read this book without learning something from it or seeing something a different way. Also it give a great insight into Steven Hawking as a person for people who know him best or colleagues of his, but from his own writing style. He has a great sense of humour, and amazing determination. This is a great final word and goodbye to a man who's theories will inspire many and live on far into the future. One day some of these theories might even become scientific laws one day."

2,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21575078-florencia,4,"A few years ago, The Times newspaper ran a headline on the front page which said 'Hawking: God Did Not Create Universe'. The article was illustrated. God was shown in a drawing by Michelangelo, looking thunderous. They printed a photo of me, looking smug. They made it look like a duel between us. But I don't have a grudge against God. I do not want to give the impression that my work is about proving or disproving the existence of God. My work is about finding a rational framework to understand the universe around us.Catechist, atheist, agnostic; I've been there. So naturally, my main interest in this book is that haunting question regarding the existence of a god, the creation of things. I had faith, I don't know where it went; perhaps a part of it went with the books I've read that made it impossible for me to absorb some notions without questioning them. I told a priest once and he looked at me as if I were selling drugs and tickets to strip clubs at school, not without expressing how presumptuous human beings are for wanting to know everything. A similar reaction is mentioned in this book.Needless remarks aside, a feeble faith tinged with fear - whereas it represents some obvious disadvantages - keeps the mind open. What do you have? The laws of nature or a self-existent and eternal being that created time and space. The complete absence of destiny or someone to blame for lousy decisions. The serenity of dust or the afterlife - on whichever side you get, because you believe or you don't. There is no wager here. There's a chance that an omniscient designer is going to notice that you're believing ""just in case"". I prefer the afterlife Hawking describes: 
wishful thinking.
 This scientist, key factor in singularities and father of Hawking Radiation, is also the master of analogies. The content of this book is a pedagogic challenge and yet, he makes it approachable. Some ideas and quotes appear more than once throughout the book (those already familiar with Hawking's work may be less enthusiastic about this) but I didn't mind; more resources for me to retain rather complex processes, while there's still light. Some of the Big Questions and one-sentence quotes:Is there a God?If you accept, as I do, that the laws of nature are fixed, then it doesn't take long to ask: what role is there for God?How did it all begin?We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe.Is there other intelligent life in the universe?I shall take this [intelligent life] to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid survival of the species.What is inside a black hole?Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science-fiction writers, but they are firmly matters of science fact.Is time travel possible?
There was a young lady of Wight Who travelled much faster than lightShe departed one day In a relative way And arrived on the previous night.
How do we shape the future?If you know how something works, you can control it.The book includes comments of those who knew Hawking: 
teacher, mentor and friend.

“While there’s life, there is hope.” 

Stephen Hawking was such an inspirational man. When he first received his diagnosis, he was ready to give up on life; he was ready to abandon his studies as his body slowly diminished, but with the help of a few friends and loved ones he managed to carry on and complete his work. And, to his surprise, he carried on living beyond what he thought was capable. So, he made the most of every moment as he pursued his academic goals. 

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

He truly was a great man. And the best thing about this book is its simplicity. Stephen Hawking is not dealing with simple things here; he is dealing with complexities that he has spent his life researching and pondering over. Yet, for all that, he makes it approachable and readable to the everyday reader. He knows his audience, and he writes for them, which is fantastic because with a book like this one could easily have become alienated. He was the leading expert in his field of theoretical physics, but he knew exactly how to communicate his ideas to the public.And that is so important. He considers huge questions in this book. Questions about time travel and alternate universes, but he discusses them in a friendly way. Anybody could read this without getting lost. I really do recommend this one. It’s a book that will make you think, and it’s a book that will make you appreciate one of the greatest scientists of his generation."
4,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Stephen HawkingStephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist who's considered one of the most brilliant scientists since Albert Einstein. In addition to making huge contributions to physics, Hawking strove to share his discoveries with the general public, and his book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a best seller. Moreover, Hawking did most of his research while battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which makes his accomplishments even more remarkable. In 'Brief Answers to Big Questions', completed after Hawking's death (from his speeches, interviews, essays, notes and lectures), the gifted scientist responds to a number of queries that are relevant to our time. However it's Hawking's QUESTIONS about relativity and quantum mechanics that will resonate going forward. In the introduction to this book, American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne writes: ""Newton gave us answers, Hawking gave us questions. And Hawking's questions themselves keep on giving, generating breakthroughs decades later. When ultimately we master the quantum gravity laws and comprehend fully the birth of our universe it may largely be by standing on the shoulders of Hawking.""Kip Thorne is an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. One of Hawking's most important contributions to science was his discovery of 'Hawking Radiation', composed of particles emitted from black holes. It was once thought that NOTHING could escape from a black hole, but this isn't the case. The idea goes as follows: Quantum mechanics implies that space is filled with particles and anti-particles - which are constantly appearing in pairs, separating, them coming together again and annihilating each other. In the presence of a black hole one member of the pair may fall into the black hole, leaving the other member without a partner to engage in mutual annihilation. This particle (or anti-particle) may escape as 'radiation' from the black hole. Sketches depicting Hawking RadiationScientists speculate that, unless a black hole gains mass (by engulfing other objects), it will eventually vanish.*****In this book Hawking answers questions he's been asked over the years. I'll give a brief synopsis of his responses, and leave you to read the book if you want more information.- Is there a God?No. Everything can be explained by the laws of nature. Matter and energy and space were spontaneously created by the Big Bang. - What came before the Big Bang?This is a meaningless question because there was no 'before' the Big Bang. Time (actually spacetime) was created BY the Big Bang. It's like asking 'what is south of the South Pole?'Spacetime (which is warped by the presence of solid matter) was formed by the Big Bang There's no 'south' of the South Pole- Is there other intelligent life in the universe?We don't know (yet) but Hawking likes to think there are other forms of intelligent life out there. They just haven't contacted Earth....perhaps because they're too far away. In any case, meeting an advanced civilization would be unadvisable (for us). Remember European settlers and American Indians? If aliens came here it would be like the film 'Independence Day.' - Can we predict the future?No. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates that we can't know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same instant. Thus we can't predict what will happen to a particle (or things made of particles) at a future time. Hawking observes: “No matter how powerful a computer you have, if you put lousy data in you will get lousy predictions out.” - What is inside a black hole? A black hole - which is single point of infinite density - is a star that's exhausted its nuclear fuel and collapsed.....but no one REALLY knows what's inside.- Is time travel possible?Theoretically yes. If spacetime was warped enough to form a loop, time travel would be possible. However, it time travel WAS possible, someone from the future would probably have come back to visit us already. In 2009, Hawking held a party for time travelers in his college at Cambridge, for a film about time travel. No one came.😊- Will we survive on Earth?Not forever. Nuclear war is a dire threat and there will be a meteorite strike at some point. Moreover, global warming is likely to make Earth uninhabitable, since our climate could become like that of Venus - boiling hot and raining sulfuric acid."" Hawking notes: ""One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will, therefore, survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a race.""- Should we colonize space?Yes. In order to survive long term, humans need to colonize other planets. This won't be cheap. Hawking helped initiate a research and engineering project called 'Breakthrough Starshot"", which strives to develop spacecraft capable of reaching the star system Alpha Centauri - which is 4.37 light-years (about 26 trillion miles) away. Hawking believes that in the next hundred years humans will be able to travel to the inner planets of the solar system and in 500 years we will have visited the nearest stars.Breakthrough Starshot- What are the prospects that scientists will unite Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum theory to achieve a complete theory of the laws of the universe?This will happen within the next millennium. - Will human genetic engineering occur?Yes. If scientists learn how to do something, SOMEONE will do it.....even if it's illegal. - Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?Yes. Computers are likely to overtake human intelligence in the next 100 years. Thus we need to ensure that computers have goals in line with ours. Just to be safe, robotic designs should always incorporate a 'kill switch.'- What world changing idea would you like to see implemented by humanity? The development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy. It would be an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming. *****Despite everything, Hawking was an optimistic soul. He advocates that we should: “Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done."" I found the book interesting and informative and would recommend it to people interested in Hawking's view of the 'big questions.'You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
5,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"Well, this was certainly a bitter-sweet read, knowing it is the last book of Steven Hawking. I wish I'd borrowed the e-book instead of the print because there are so many things I'd have loved to highlight. In Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Stephen Hawking attempts to answer 10 big questions, such as: •How did the universe begin?•Is there a god?•What is inside a black hole?•Is it possible to time travel?•Will AI outsmart us and if so, should we be worried?These and other questions are answered with brief, simple explanations. Steven Hawking's brilliance shines through on every page. His wittiness is prevalent throughout the book as well (including some wonderful jabs at Donnie-johnnie Trump. Suffice it to say, Mr. Hawking was not a fan!).I absolutely loved this book. I only wish it could have been longer. Steven Hawking was such a gift to humanity, his genius will live on for as long as there is intelligent life to appreciate his many contributions. I am so sad to have finished this book, but so glad to have read it.
""This is not the end of the story, but just the beginning of what I hope will be billions of years of life flourishing in the cosmos.”

6,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25398561-andr-oliveira,5,"In this book Stephen Hawking, possibly the last book written by him, answers some big questions and makes some predictions for the future taking into account the current state of science. How did it all begin? Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Is time travel possible? Obviously, I wasn't expecting solutions for these questions, but Stephen Hawking is able to explain complicated questions in a way that everyone would understand. Also, I love how Stephen Hawking answers those questions without disregarding other's beliefs.

""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

7,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709846-manuel-ant-o,4,"If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Closed Time-like Curves: “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” by Stephen Hawking“Is there any point in hosting a party for time travelers? Would you hope anyone would turn up?Hawking’s answer: In 2009 I held a party for time travelers in my college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge, for a film about time travel. To ensure that only genuine time travelers came, I didn’t send out the invitation until after the party. On the day of the party, I sat in college, hoping but no one came. I was disappointed, but not surprised, because I had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is positive, time travel is not possible. I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong.”In “Brief Answers to the Big Questions – The Final Book” by Stephen Hawking.I'm not really asking a question - a lot of what Hawking talks about really isn't even theoretically testable. Theoretical physics does tend in that direction - often it talks about ideas that are not testable yet, and may not be for a long time, or which are mathematical speculation as much as observation."
8,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10039791-giorgio,3,"Why 3 stars if the book is well-written?Well, there is NOTHING NEW.He just said again and again what he always said...Maybe it should be sold as ""Hawking in 90 minutes"" or ""Hawking for Dummies""...Yes, his life was really RICH in experiencies, and pain, and fight to overcome an ammount of things that almost nobody could... but...At the end, I did not feel any ""answer"", just plain stabilishment cientific thinking.Not enough for me."
9,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Part of the legacy of an exceptional genius, a source of inspiration and a science communicator.Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Hawking understood how to use his life in many ways in exemplary fashion, despite his adverse health, and to research with full vigor. He was an inspiration to millions of people despite all the restrictions. And he used the nimbus as a genius, who is caged in his body, to achieve that goal. The press loved Hawking and he played with the media channels like a virtuoso. He was for understandable and entertaining science journalism away from the academic ivory tower. Far away from academics who fail because of their inability to explain their theses understandably and rousingly. And feast themselves on their lonely genius instead. Hawking wanted to make science accessible to the masses of people, fueling joy and enthusiasm, inspiring a new generation of researchers. Like other visionaries like Neil de Grasse Tyson, Carl Sagan and many others. The generation of bloggers known in the new media, Youtubers, etc. is inspired by him too.His unusual life enabled him to gain a reputation he probably would never have attained to that extent. And he was an inspiring model to all procrastinating, passive, blaming, quarreling, ... people in the affluent societies. How ridiculous is it when healthy people wallow in their self-pity or are unable to control their emotions. A quick look at the philanthropy and kindness of an exceptional explorer like Hawking would suffice. To shamefully take consequences and prioritize self-discipline, in order not to stagnate further.Concerning the ideological aspects of Hawking's work, every reader has to find his own approach. Depending on one´s preferred beliefs, agnosticism, atheism, nihilism, pastafarianism, ... his interpretations have a different status. Hawking's metaphysical hypotheses permeate his work and are relevant to readers who are not only interested in pure science. As well as his political analyzes and warnings.In addition to inspirational quotes, Hawking also left warnings of various, future dangers. Both should be used in the sense of a productive use of his legacy. The wisdom of his mantras and the pessimism of his warnings of AI and alien intelligences.The safety of AI depends on two factors: human competence and computer security. That sounds very frightening, but it should work in practice because a lot of infrastructures depends on it. Although similar thoughts revolved around the safety of nuclear weapons: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...But as long as capable programmers implement sufficient security mechanisms to never provide the AI with too much power and access rights, this danger is eliminated. And if these KIs are sufficiently protected against infiltration and sabotage, its fatal manipulation and misappropriation can be prevented. The only problem is that autonomous physical and purely virtual weapons systems need a lot of self-sufficiency and networking to work ""well."" Like all logistical, economic and process engineering applications. This will be a balancing act. Hopefully, nobody will stumble over the Terminator.The extraterrestrial intelligences are a different caliber and no approach is consistent. One can optimistically run to ruin or pessimistically pursue isolationism. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages. In Hawking's opinion, we would do well to behave as inconspicuously as possible and quietly evolve as quickly as possible. And in as little space as possible with fewer signals, emissions and detectable activities on just a few planets. This would entail restrictions on the use of new communications capabilities that are yet to be developed, space colonization, asteroid mining, and so on — all key technologies for the further development of humanity. For economic reasons, one will take all risks and expand as far as technically possible forever until it becomes clear which assumption was correct. There is a contradiction between Hawking's urge for space colonization with self-sufficient settlements with independent populations and his warning to be unobtrusive. Both are not possible at the same time. Humanity will gamble and hopefully win. The dangers of improving humans through genetic engineering and implants are small footnotes in relation to machine apocalypse or alien invasion. China has most likely already begun and everyone else will follow. As always, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Lapidar and soberly said, there were always hierarchies and society pyramids. It would be hypocritical now to pretend that immediate improvement and gene optimization would make a difference and break the taboo. Much ideology plays into it. The poverty that arises from the lack of distributive justice is the problem. And not whether the one human is breathing with gills underwater and lives 1000 years or forever and the other with fewer enhancements can only live 500 years and can afford a little less intelligence increase. There is no difference to today. For Hawking, the easily preventable diseases of civilization are incomprehensible. That so many people fail to get up regularly from sitting, eat less and move their lazy posteriors. Instead of just eating from 7 to 22 and not moving at all. Because it really is not rocket technology to get some ambitions not to die earlier because of stupid and preventable reasons. The criticized hostility to science will become another embarrassing footnote in history. One just has to sit out the time and mindfully avoid dealing with such channels. Prefer to actively participate in the dissemination of knowledge and the passing of the torch to the youth. Because with personified stupidity, ignorance, counseling resistance and lack of learning ability cannot be discussed. Therefore, it would be lost love and waste of time even to seek dialogue with such individuals engaging in those political agendas. Neither of both sides would benefit from it. It´s just a great pity that problems such as declining biodiversity, environmental degradation, global warming,… can only be resolved by a common consensus.Especially now that research is opening up more doors than ever before, a healthy mix of caution and curiosity is required. One never knows what one awakens. Be it in machines, unstoppable processes or in the vastness of space.Ein Teil des Vermächtnisses eines Jahrhundertgenies, einer Inspirationsquelle und Wissenschaftskommunikators.Hawking verstand es, sein Leben trotz widrigen Gesundheitszustandes in vielfacher Weise vorbildhaft zu nutzen und voller Elan zu forschen. Er war trotz aller Einschränkungen eine Inspiration für Millionen Menschen. Und er nutzte den Nimbus als in seinem Körper eingesperrtes Genie geschickt, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Die Presse liebte Hawking und er spielte auf ihre wie ein Virtuose.Er war für einen verständlichen und unterhaltsamen Wissenschaftsjournalismus abseits vom akademischen Elfenbeinturm. Weit weg von Akademikern, die an der Unfähigkeit scheitern, ihre Thesen verständlich und mitreißend erklären zu können. Und sich stattdessen an ihrem einsamen Genie ergötzen. Hawking wollte Wissenschaft für die breite Masse der Menschen zugänglich machen, Freude und Begeisterung schüren und damit eine neue Generation von Forschern inspirieren. Wie andere Visionäre wie Neil de GrasseTyson, Carl Sagan und viele andere. Auch die Generation der in den neuen Medien bekannten Blogger, Youtuber, etc. ist von ihm inspiriert. Sein ungewöhnliches Leben ermöglichte es ihm, eine Bekanntheit zu erlangen, die er so wahrscheinlich nie in diesem Ausmaß erlangt hätte. Und er war für alle prokrastinierenden, passiven, anderen die Schuld zuschiebenden, hadernden,…Menschen in den Wohlstandsgesellschaften ein Mahnmal. Denn wie lächerlich ist es, wenn gesunde Menschen sich in ihrem eigenen Selbstmitleid suhlen oder unfähig sind, ihre Emotionen zu kontrollieren. Dabei würde ein kurzer Blick auf die Philantrophie und Güte eines Ausnahmeforschers wie Hawking genügen. Um peinlich berührt Konsequenz und Selbstdisziplin zu forcieren, um nicht weiter zu stagnieren.Hinsichtlich der ideologischen Aspekte in Hawkings Werk muss jeder Leser seine eigene Herangehensweise finden. Je nach präferierten Glauben, Agnostizismus, Atheismus, Nihilismus, Pastafarismus,… haben sie einen anderen Stellenwert. Hawkings metaphysische Hypothesen durchziehen sein Werk und sind für Leser relevant, die nicht nur an der reinen Naturwissenschaft interessiert sind. Gleich wie auch seine politischen Analysen und Warnungen. Neben inspirierenden Zitaten hinterließ Hawking auch Warnungen vor diversen, zukünftigen Gefahren. Im Sinne einer fruchtbaren Nutzung seines Vermächtnisses sollte beides genutzt werden. Die Weisheit seiner Mantras und der Pessimismus seiner Warnungen vor KIs und außerirdischen Intelligenzen.Die Sicherheit von KIs hängt an 2 Faktoren: menschlicher Kompetenz und Computersicherheit. Das klingt sehr erschreckend, dürfte in der Praxis aber funktionieren, weil viel Infrastruktur daran hängt. Obwohl man das bei Kernwaffen auch dachte: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...Aber solange fähige Programmierer ausreichende Sicherheitsmechanismen einbauen, um die KI nie mit zu viel Machtfülle und Zugriffsrechten auszustatten, ist diese Gefahr ausgeräumt. Und wenn diese KIs ausreichend vor Infiltration und Sabotage geschützt sind, lässt sich ihre fatale Manipulation und Zwecksentfremdung verhindern. Das Problem ist nur, dass autonome physische und rein virtuelle Waffensysteme viel Autarkie und Vernetzung benötigen, um ""gut"" funktionieren zu können. Wie auch alle logistischen, wirtschaftlichen und prozesstechnischen Anwendungen. Das wird ein Balanceakt werden, bei dem hoffentlich niemand über den Terminator stolpert. Die außerirdischen Intelligenzen sind ein anderes Kaliber und kein Lösungsansatz ist konsistent. Grundsätzlich kann man optimistisch ins Verderben rennen oder pessimistisch Isolationismus betreiben. Jede Option hat für sich Vorteile und Nachteile. Nach Hawkings Meinung täten wir gut daran, uns möglichst unauffällig zu verhalten und still und heimlich möglichst schnell weiter zu evolvieren. Und das auf so wenig Raum wie möglich mit so wenig Signalen, Emissionen und detektierbaren Aktivitäten wie möglich. Das würde Einschränkungen bei dem Einsatz neuer, noch zu entwickelnder Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten, Weltraumkolonisation, Asteroidenbergbau, usw. mit sich bringen. Alles Schlüsseltechnologien für die weitere Entwicklung der Menschheit. Man wird aus ökonomischen Gründen alle Risiken eingehen und so weit wie technisch möglich expandieren. Bis sich zeigt, welche Annahme richtig war. Es besteht ein Widerspruch zwischen Hawkings drängen auf eine Weltraumkolonisation mit autarken Siedlungen mit ausreichender Population und seiner Warnung. Die Gefahren der Verbesserung des Menschen mittels Gentechnik und Implantaten sind in Relation zu Maschinenapokalypse oder einer Alieninvasion kleine Fußnoten. China hat sehr wahrscheinlich längst damit begonnen und alle anderen werden folgen. Wie immer, ""It´s the economy, stupid."" Lapidar und nüchtern gesagt gab es immer Hierarchien und Gesellschaftspyramiden. Es wäre jetzt scheinheilig, so zu tun als würde unmittelbare Verbesserung und Optimierung einen Unterschied machen und einen ach so großen Tabubruch darstellen. Viel Ideologie spielt da mit hinein. Die Armut, die aus der mangelnden Verteilungsgerechtigkeit erwächst, ist das Problem. Und nicht, ob der eine Mensch mit Kiemen unter Wasser atmen und 1000 Jahre alt werden und der andere ""nur"" halb so alt wird und sich etwas weniger Intelligenzsteigerung leisten kann.Nicht nachvollziehbar sind für Hawking die so leicht zu verhindernden Zivilisationskrankheiten. Dass so viele Menschen es nicht schaffen, regelmäßig vom Sitzen aufzustehen, weniger zu essen und sich zu bewegen. Anstatt nur zu essen und sich gar nicht zu bewegen. Denn es ist wirklich keine Raketentechnik. Die von ihm kritisierte Wissenschaftsfeindlichkeit wird eine weitere peinliche Fußnote in der Geschichte werden. Man muss die Zeit nur aussitzen und achtsam den Umgang mit derartigen Kanälen meiden. Lieber aktiv an der Verbreitung von Wissen und dem Reichen der Fackel an die Jugend partizipieren. Denn mit Dummheit, Ignoranz, Beratungsresistenz und mangelnder Lernfähigkeit lässt sich nicht diskutieren. Deswegen wäre es verlorene Liebemühe und Zeitverschwendung, mit solchen Individuen und politischen Strömungen überhaupt einen Dialog zu suchen. Keine der Parteien hätte davon irgendeinen Nutzen. Blöd nur, dass Probleme wie zurück gehende Biodiversität, Umweltzerstörung und Klimaerwärmung nur auf Basis eines gemeinsamen Konsens gelöst werden können.Gerade jetzt, wo die Forschung so viele Türen aufstößt wie noch nie, ist eine gesunde Mischung aus Vorsicht und Neugierde angesagt. Man weiß nie, was man weckt. Sei es in Maschinen, nicht mehr aufzuhaltenden Prozessen oder in den Weiten des Alls."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

★ This is the book that I decided to start my year with and I am glad that I did so. I have been meaning to read more non-fiction and more science books and I believe that this was a very good choice! It was my first exposure to Hawking as an author and I certainly want to read his other book (which I already own) later this year.★ As the name implies, the book asks ten grand questions and then try to answer them briefly and simply and if you are curious to what these questions are then here is a small list of them:1. Is there a God?2. How did it all begin?3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe?4. Can we predict the future?5. What is inside a black hole?6. Is time travel possible?7. Will we survive on Earth?8. Should we colonize space?9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?10. How do we shape the future?★ I think there are 2 things regarding those questions and answers that I should mention and that you should know if you ever decided that you want to read the book: The first thing is that the author does not hold back and he tries to explain everything and he sometimes opposes the religion so you have to read this with an open-mind. The second thing is that the language was scientific but it was as simple as it could be. I have to be honest and admit that I did not understand 100% of what was written as I am also not a physicists but a physician! I think that it is okay though because it was written by one of the world’s smartest authors (quite literally) and I am not one of the world’s smartest readers!★ I found this book to be real eye-opening and it made me ask questions, it has been 2 weeks since I finished it but I am still thinking about it! The way the questions were tackled was very logical and you could tell Hawking knows how we think! I was amazed by how humble and funny he was as a human being (Even when he addressed his personal life and health issues) and the journey through this book was really inspiring! I may not agree with all his ideas but I sure respect him as a human and as a man of science!

“While there’s life, there is hope.”

★ Summary: If you are looking for a great science non-fiction book then do no more because Stephen Hawking got you covered with his last book! The book answers ten questions although sometimes it spins in circle before doing so. The writing was easier than expected and the book was a pleasant surprise! I have already recommended it to a couple of friends and I know it will be the catalyst to a few heated-debates with said friends! R.I.P. Stephen Hawking!You can get more books from Book Depository"
11,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"This is my first book of 2019. As a thought-provoking book from one of the leading thinkers till recent times, a good way to start the year. I have previously read his “A brief history of time” and “The grand design” both of which I liked for presenting serious science in a very readable form. This book released after Stephen Hawking’s death does not disappoint, and is a great compilation of the most important topics Hawking dealt with in his lifetime – and these topics are also those most of us are extremely curious about. There are a couple of good forewords from Eddie Redmayne who played him in the movie “The theory of everything” and scientist Kip Thorne, who writes of his inspiration from Stephen Hawking’s life on his work on gravitational waves. The afterword by his daughter Lucy is touching including mentioning the impact he had on people as could be seen by the large crowds which quietly lined the street on his passing. The first topic in the is – “Is there a God?”. Hawking’s views on this are already public, and also included in the movie based on his life. The point he makes is that religion describes God as some kind of a superhuman whom we can discuss/debate with and be judged by (some traditions such as Advaita Vedanta do not do that though). He goes on to discuss how time itself started with the big bang and the universe, and well-defined laws of nature mean there is nothing for a God to do. You may agree, partly agree or disagree with his views, but he certainly offers a lot of food for thought. The next topic is on how it all started with the big bang. While all the answers are yet not there, Hawking is confident that physics will crack the puzzle of how the universe sprang from nothing. There is already a lot of progress made such as with M-theory. The section on black holes is probably the most detailed and it is also a bit dense in parts. This is probably the area Stephen Hawking has contributed the most, and I suppose that explains the level of detail. The discussion is fascinating – do black holes retain context and information of what goes in? How do they come about, and how can study them?In the discussions around climate change, and in fleeting references in other sections as well, Hawking stresses that we are being very irresponsible with respect to Planet Earth, and people in power had better pay attention to this. The other sections on space travel, AI make for interesting reading as well.This book is certainly a tribute to Stephen Hawking’s curiosity, passion for science and intellectual genius. A great book to start the year – very intellectually stimulating.My rating: 4.5 / 5."

I have a pile of friends who have grown a hatred for science merely because of the fact that their teachers couldn't simply explain and illuminate the stuff that Hawking has covered in his books. In this book, he answers 10 questions and some of them have been brought up in his other books, yet this book is the extract of his work and could be recommended to anyone who wants to start reading Hawking. I have summarized the first two questions in the following pic, which were the most important ones to me. The rest of the questions somehow depend on humans and their behaviour, which I personally am so pessimist about.I would love to be as hopeful as Hawking, but let's get real, take a look around, no promising sign! Look at the role models of younger generations, look at the number of followers on Kim Kardashian's Instagram page... I mean seriously 150 million people?? man this fucked up world is doomed! Even Hawking's dead :( matching soundtrack:day one/Hans ZimmerP.s: I almost got 10 years older due to reuploading the pic, I can't help it, if you want a high-quality one just let me know"
13,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,4,"""Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""I loved loved loved this book. I have always been fascinated by science and astronomy and I have never read anything by Stephen Hawking, and this book was absolutely fascinating and thought provoking to me. I loved hearing his theories about our future and I agree with a lot about what he has to say about religion and how human fascination with science and space travel is so important for our future. I really agree with that statement about having all our eggs in one basket and how it's important for us to find a new home.Here is an amazing quote where Stephen Hawking explains better than I could ever attempt to why I'm not a religious person: “Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion. Religion was an early attempt to answer the questions we all ask: why are we here, where did we come from? Long ago, the answer was almost always the same: gods made everything. The world was a scary place, so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning, storms or eclipses. Nowadays, science provides better and more consistent answers, but people will always cling to religion, because it gives comfort, and they do not trust or understand science.” I loved this book. I will admit some if it went way over my head with the mathematics and equations and quantum physics but I did my best and I feel like I learned a lot while reading this. RIP Stephen Hawking."
14,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Having always had much admiration for the way Stephen Hawking has lived his life, overcoming adversity to become one of the brightest stars in our sky (pun absolutely intended), I was intrigued to see what his last contribution would bring with it. One of the things I most appreciate about him and his books is that he makes often complex and complicated topics accessible to everyday individuals such as myself - those without a background or degree in the sciences, and here he explores some of the biggest and most important unanswered questions (hence the title) in a way that is understandable to all and doesn't require expert or previous knowledge on said topics.I am sad that no more of his fantastic works can now be published, and I have huge respect for him as although he certainly had some challenging obstacles to overcome he has contributed so much to what we now know which is more than most of us will achieve in this life - the word inspirational is what immediately comes to mind. A thoroughly engaging, intriguing and enjoyable romp through Hawking's opinion on age-old, philosophical questions right through to some of those at the forefront of current affairs. Rest in peace, Professor Hawking!"

The Big questions are:Is there a God?How did it all begin?Is time travel possible?What is inside of a black hole?Is there other intelligent life in the universe?Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?How do we shape the future?Should we colonize space?Can we predict the future?Will we survive on earth? I highly recommend this book."
17,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Even though the book was meant to be as exoteric as possible, it is still rather thorough for the general public. To me, the answers were prolix and discursive. Much explaining was done, but I often found myself asking ""How's that relevant to the question?""."

19,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,5,"Just as I finished reading Brief Answers to the Big Questions this morning, the power came on again. It had been off since 08:00 to about 12:00, and also from 09:00 to 00:00 last night, in what our South African electricity utility Eskom terms ‘load shedding’ (Stage 2). Due to unplanned breakdowns in its generating capacity, the utility effectively institutes rolling blackouts across the country to reduce peak demand, and to ultimately avoid a total system collapse, following which it will take weeks to restore the national grid.Local municipalities do institute a load-shedding schedule so that we as residents can prepare, but these are invariably outdated or inaccurate. In addition, the electricity supply situation is so volatile it can change faster than you can say ‘lightbulb’ (one night in December we hit a new record of Stage 6 load-shedding, with all the schedules now updated to accommodate up to an ominous-sounding Stage 8.)What does this have to do with Stephen Hawking’s book? In Part 10, ‘How Do We Shape The Future?’, Hawking’s response to what his ‘world-changing idea’ would be is quite simple, and drolly amusing in our own context: “… the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy …”In South Africa, The Powers That Be have deemed that coal-fired power stations are still the way to go, with the State-owned electricity actively legislating against independent power producers and renewable energy due to a perceived threat of competition, and our plentiful supply of cheap coal (a classic monopoly situation, though this is changing as the wheels now start to come off.)What is holding us back in South Africa at this precise point in time? Politics; and self-serving politicians. With the ruling party’s grip on complete power being slowly eroded, and every day bringing more damning news of State capture of the essential organs of government, patronage, and systemic corruption, there is such a bun fight at the moment that everything else that really matters – such as functioning infrastructure and economic growth – go out the window as political fat cats jockey and squabble for their privileged position at the public trough.Ideally, what our electricity utility should do is bring in external experts to conduct a thorough audit of its generating capacity, what the precise technical and coal-supply issues are, and then to devise a proper timetable that can be adhered to, budgeted and costed for, and then also give us a much-needed light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.But as Hawking himself warns in this brilliant book, there is an alarming revolt against expertise in general and science in particular engulfing the world as nationalism and prejudice increase inexorably: “With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.”Hawking calls for a renewed faith in science, as it were, in order to harness the power of technology to solve our current problems, which are alarming in their severity and potential to become exponentially worse. The main issues here, of course, are climate change, the burgeoning global population, and how to ensure dignity and a reasonable quality of life for all.I loved this incredible book, which I think is such a fitting tribute to the legacy of Stephen Hawking, both as a scientist, a teacher and influencer, a father, and a husband. Perhaps Hawking’s daunting physical struggle against his MLS is what influenced his ferocious tenacity in ferreting out scientific questions and implications that continue to have a profound impact on Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in the form of M-theory.From the provocative opening chapter entitled ‘Is There a God?’, the book provides a readily understandable (and equation-free) introduction to Hawking’s major scientific contributions. What I enjoyed the most though were the wide-ranging chapters towards the end, such as ‘Will We Survive on Earth?’ to ‘Should We Colonise Space?’ and ‘Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?’, to the thought-provoking and deeply personal final chapter, ‘How Do We Shape the Future?’In her Afterword, daughter Lucy Hawking reveals that her father knew about, and approved, of this book, which is effectively culled from a lifetime of writing and thinking. Even though it is heavily edited and condensed, the man’s impish humour, compassion, and innate grasp of the essence of any problem, so matter how large or small, is evident on every page.I was also fascinated to learn how Hawking’s legacy is continuing, in the form of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, and the Future of Life Institute. What delighted me equally is Hawking’s abiding love for science fiction. He comments intelligently and fondly on everything from Star Trek to Back to the Future and Interstellar. This is truly a book to cherish."

Included is a foreword from Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne, who played Hawking in the movie The Theory of Everything; an introduction by Nobel Prize-winning physicist and Hawking's lifelong friend, Kip Thorne; and a touching afterword from Hawking's daughter, Lucy.“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.

I get it, when someone with the stature of Hawking passes away, the demand for a book is there. And since I believe Hawking to be an extraordinary person, what objection could there be for this release? My main gripe is the editing. It's beyond my grasp how such a wide-spread book could be edited so poorly, making it feel rushed and cheap. There are a lot of sentences and entire paragraphs being repeated in different chapters. None of which feel right, they could've easily be skipped over or paraphrased in different ways. Other than that, this book gives people who were already familiar with Hawking's beliefs nothing new. Yet the book is very much about those beliefs. I would've understood the appeal of a more personal memoir as a quick posthumous work, but I'm not quite clear what the target audience is in this case.Despite all that, it's Hawking, it's inspiring, it's at times thought provoking. I think the final chapters concerning A.I., space colonisation and the problems humanity faces in this and coming centuries are where this work shines."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

Poignantly bookended by a beautifully written Foreword from Eddie Redmayne and a touching Afterword from his daughter, Lucy Hawking, this book is a collection of essays which attempt to answer some of the biggest questions rooted in science, and to an extent philosophy, posed to humankind. From the existence of God and other intelligent life in the universe, to time and space travel, and whether we will survive on Earth, or will artificial intelligence outsmart humans - Hawking's addressed these issues in his usual authentic, direct and honest manner. While there are some hard science smattered throughout the narrative, especially when the topic centred around cosmology, a substantial chunk of the writing can be easily comprehended without requiring a physics degree. I believe this is a book which should be read by everyone as it tackles some really pressing issues about the future of humanity. 

We spend a great deal of time studying history, which, let's face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it's a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence. We are aware of the potential dangers, but perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialisation.

Reading a tiny piece of his mind is and will always be fascinating! It was such an easy book to read. No need to be a science nerd like in The Big bang Theory to enjoy that book. He is easy to understand and should we talk about his sense of humour? I don't think so but I laughed so much!he was such an inspiration and will keep being an inspirational man...

One may think that this book is indeed what it looks like – a genius addressing big and teeny tiny little bit naïve questions that you and me are longing to ask, such as How Did It All Begin? Is There Other Intelligent Life In The Universe? Can We Predict Future? What Is Inside a Black Hole? Is Time Travel Possible? Will We Survive on Earth? and naturally following Should We Colonise Space? In reality, this book is bigger on the inside. It teaches us (again) to ask bold, big questions – something which seemed perfectly fine for us when we were children and makes us look like dilettantes uttering nonsense now. It kindly reminds us of our endless possibilities no matter how restricted by circumstances we feel. It shows us the infinite beauty of things which are much bigger than our understanding and much older that anything we can possibly imagine for comparison. It tells us stories of stars that died unbelievably long ago and stars that are living so far we most likely will never see them. It proves us why being ”scientifically literate” is important for our future and for the future of our children. And, first and foremost, it tells the story of a boy who passionately, without cease, asked questions and refused to believe in boundaries. Instead, he believed in endless possibilities if not of a single human being, then of the curious, smart and brave generations to come."

I took this one out from a library, but I liked it so much I bought a copy and intend to reread it in the near future. There are passages of beauty and awe throughout his scientific explanations. In addition to explaining the origins of the universe, Hawking described his own origins: ""I wanted to be a great scientist. However, I wasn't a very good student when I was at school, and was rarely more than halfway up my class... but I had good friends at school. And we talked about everything and, specifically, the origin of the universe. this is where my dream began..."" (p. 20).In answering the questions of our origins, Hawking argued:""I have no desire to offend anyone of faith, but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator.."" (p. 34). Hawking continued to explain his thoughts on the question of a afterlife: ""I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think when we die we return to dust. But there's a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life..."" (p. 38).Hawking warns of the dangers of nuclear weapons and climate change. Although he does not endorse genetic engineering of humans, he does warn that it is inevitable.In relation to our future as a species and the connection to technology Hawking writes: ""I believe the future of communication is brain-computer interfaces."" (p. 194). He expands: ""Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it."" (p. 196).There in his final paragraph, Hawking leaves us this memorable advice: ""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet."" (p. 211)."

His research and ideas have forever changed how we see and know the universe around us. His theories on Black Holes have changed Cosmology as much, or more, that the ground breaking works by Galileo and Einstein. His ideas and theories will effect his field forever but it is his personality and drive that we should also not forget. Despite being told in his early twenties that he wouldn't live more than another five years, due to Motor Neuron Disease, Hawking set forth and continued towards his educational, career, family and personal goals and lived another fifty years, succeeding even beyond his own wildest dreams.In this book, Hawking gives us his thoughts and ideas on ten ""big questions"" including; god, other intelligent life in the universe, time travel, the need to colonize space, and artificial intelligence. He writes in a manner that presents the science in a way that is both easy to understand and that shares his personal thoughts and feelings.Hawking pointed out that science is currently out of favor with the general public and that this will prove to be a large problem for both individuals and society as a whole. He presents some ideas on how to get people more excited about both science and how it will effect the world. I think reading this book would be a good start."
28,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"This book has been compiled by daughter Lucy Hawking and contains an anthology of the most important popularizing work of her father Stephen. Although it was published after his death, Hawking was involved in the editing process at the end of his life, but he didn't really finish it. Of course I recognized many pieces from ""A Brief History of Time"", the book for which Hawking is best known to the general public and which I read a few weeks ago. In that sense it did not offer me much new, except for the pieces that dealt with climate change and artificial intelligence.What is striking once again is the remarkable social involvement of Hawking (cf. the aforementioned themes), his humour and his openly professed optimism, which was based on a strong belief in science (he uses the word ‘belief’ explicitly). Just like in ""A Brief History"", his ability to clearly explain extremely difficult matters (on black holes for instance) is striking. The only regrettable, but at the same time unavoidable thing is that it is noticeable that this book consists of cutting and pasting from different sources. (2.5 stars)"

Simply for the very reason the something coming from the smartest men of the previous 2 generations would be overly complicated and beyond my understanding. What I discovered in this book is Steven Hawking was just a great man as we was a scientist, but an incredible teacher as well. His method of writing allows people like, who have a passing interest in but only a vacation of his ability in science to understand his work. This skill cannot be understated as if the most knowledgeable person in the world cannot comuninate their knowledge it is list with them. Sort of like sending it into a black hole. The book is easily readable, Hawking' s dry wit and sense of humour makes reading and learning from it a pleasure. The metaphors on this book allowed me to grasp the basics of even the most complicated theories easily. Though I differ from him from a belief perspective, I do respect his ideas and I think like any great teacher Hawking would have welcomed this difference of opinion as a show of curiosity towards finding the truth.I am sure his views, and more in-depth theories will go a long way towards solving many of the great world wide problems highlighted in this book that we face today.I would recommend this book to any. It is a great read, and I don't thing anyone can read this book without learning something from it or seeing something a different way. Also it give a great insight into Steven Hawking as a person for people who know him best or colleagues of his, but from his own writing style. He has a great sense of humour, and amazing determination. This is a great final word and goodbye to a man who's theories will inspire many and live on far into the future. One day some of these theories might even become scientific laws one day."

32,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21575078-florencia,4,"A few years ago, The Times newspaper ran a headline on the front page which said 'Hawking: God Did Not Create Universe'. The article was illustrated. God was shown in a drawing by Michelangelo, looking thunderous. They printed a photo of me, looking smug. They made it look like a duel between us. But I don't have a grudge against God. I do not want to give the impression that my work is about proving or disproving the existence of God. My work is about finding a rational framework to understand the universe around us.Catechist, atheist, agnostic; I've been there. So naturally, my main interest in this book is that haunting question regarding the existence of a god, the creation of things. I had faith, I don't know where it went; perhaps a part of it went with the books I've read that made it impossible for me to absorb some notions without questioning them. I told a priest once and he looked at me as if I were selling drugs and tickets to strip clubs at school, not without expressing how presumptuous human beings are for wanting to know everything. A similar reaction is mentioned in this book.Needless remarks aside, a feeble faith tinged with fear - whereas it represents some obvious disadvantages - keeps the mind open. What do you have? The laws of nature or a self-existent and eternal being that created time and space. The complete absence of destiny or someone to blame for lousy decisions. The serenity of dust or the afterlife - on whichever side you get, because you believe or you don't. There is no wager here. There's a chance that an omniscient designer is going to notice that you're believing ""just in case"". I prefer the afterlife Hawking describes: 
wishful thinking.
 This scientist, key factor in singularities and father of Hawking Radiation, is also the master of analogies. The content of this book is a pedagogic challenge and yet, he makes it approachable. Some ideas and quotes appear more than once throughout the book (those already familiar with Hawking's work may be less enthusiastic about this) but I didn't mind; more resources for me to retain rather complex processes, while there's still light. Some of the Big Questions and one-sentence quotes:Is there a God?If you accept, as I do, that the laws of nature are fixed, then it doesn't take long to ask: what role is there for God?How did it all begin?We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe.Is there other intelligent life in the universe?I shall take this [intelligent life] to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid survival of the species.What is inside a black hole?Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science-fiction writers, but they are firmly matters of science fact.Is time travel possible?
There was a young lady of Wight Who travelled much faster than lightShe departed one day In a relative way And arrived on the previous night.
How do we shape the future?If you know how something works, you can control it.The book includes comments of those who knew Hawking: 
teacher, mentor and friend.

“While there’s life, there is hope.” 

Stephen Hawking was such an inspirational man. When he first received his diagnosis, he was ready to give up on life; he was ready to abandon his studies as his body slowly diminished, but with the help of a few friends and loved ones he managed to carry on and complete his work. And, to his surprise, he carried on living beyond what he thought was capable. So, he made the most of every moment as he pursued his academic goals. 

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

He truly was a great man. And the best thing about this book is its simplicity. Stephen Hawking is not dealing with simple things here; he is dealing with complexities that he has spent his life researching and pondering over. Yet, for all that, he makes it approachable and readable to the everyday reader. He knows his audience, and he writes for them, which is fantastic because with a book like this one could easily have become alienated. He was the leading expert in his field of theoretical physics, but he knew exactly how to communicate his ideas to the public.And that is so important. He considers huge questions in this book. Questions about time travel and alternate universes, but he discusses them in a friendly way. Anybody could read this without getting lost. I really do recommend this one. It’s a book that will make you think, and it’s a book that will make you appreciate one of the greatest scientists of his generation."
34,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Stephen HawkingStephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist who's considered one of the most brilliant scientists since Albert Einstein. In addition to making huge contributions to physics, Hawking strove to share his discoveries with the general public, and his book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a best seller. Moreover, Hawking did most of his research while battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which makes his accomplishments even more remarkable. In 'Brief Answers to Big Questions', completed after Hawking's death (from his speeches, interviews, essays, notes and lectures), the gifted scientist responds to a number of queries that are relevant to our time. However it's Hawking's QUESTIONS about relativity and quantum mechanics that will resonate going forward. In the introduction to this book, American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne writes: ""Newton gave us answers, Hawking gave us questions. And Hawking's questions themselves keep on giving, generating breakthroughs decades later. When ultimately we master the quantum gravity laws and comprehend fully the birth of our universe it may largely be by standing on the shoulders of Hawking.""Kip Thorne is an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. One of Hawking's most important contributions to science was his discovery of 'Hawking Radiation', composed of particles emitted from black holes. It was once thought that NOTHING could escape from a black hole, but this isn't the case. The idea goes as follows: Quantum mechanics implies that space is filled with particles and anti-particles - which are constantly appearing in pairs, separating, them coming together again and annihilating each other. In the presence of a black hole one member of the pair may fall into the black hole, leaving the other member without a partner to engage in mutual annihilation. This particle (or anti-particle) may escape as 'radiation' from the black hole. Sketches depicting Hawking RadiationScientists speculate that, unless a black hole gains mass (by engulfing other objects), it will eventually vanish.*****In this book Hawking answers questions he's been asked over the years. I'll give a brief synopsis of his responses, and leave you to read the book if you want more information.- Is there a God?No. Everything can be explained by the laws of nature. Matter and energy and space were spontaneously created by the Big Bang. - What came before the Big Bang?This is a meaningless question because there was no 'before' the Big Bang. Time (actually spacetime) was created BY the Big Bang. It's like asking 'what is south of the South Pole?'Spacetime (which is warped by the presence of solid matter) was formed by the Big Bang There's no 'south' of the South Pole- Is there other intelligent life in the universe?We don't know (yet) but Hawking likes to think there are other forms of intelligent life out there. They just haven't contacted Earth....perhaps because they're too far away. In any case, meeting an advanced civilization would be unadvisable (for us). Remember European settlers and American Indians? If aliens came here it would be like the film 'Independence Day.' - Can we predict the future?No. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates that we can't know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same instant. Thus we can't predict what will happen to a particle (or things made of particles) at a future time. Hawking observes: “No matter how powerful a computer you have, if you put lousy data in you will get lousy predictions out.” - What is inside a black hole? A black hole - which is single point of infinite density - is a star that's exhausted its nuclear fuel and collapsed.....but no one REALLY knows what's inside.- Is time travel possible?Theoretically yes. If spacetime was warped enough to form a loop, time travel would be possible. However, it time travel WAS possible, someone from the future would probably have come back to visit us already. In 2009, Hawking held a party for time travelers in his college at Cambridge, for a film about time travel. No one came.😊- Will we survive on Earth?Not forever. Nuclear war is a dire threat and there will be a meteorite strike at some point. Moreover, global warming is likely to make Earth uninhabitable, since our climate could become like that of Venus - boiling hot and raining sulfuric acid."" Hawking notes: ""One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will, therefore, survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a race.""- Should we colonize space?Yes. In order to survive long term, humans need to colonize other planets. This won't be cheap. Hawking helped initiate a research and engineering project called 'Breakthrough Starshot"", which strives to develop spacecraft capable of reaching the star system Alpha Centauri - which is 4.37 light-years (about 26 trillion miles) away. Hawking believes that in the next hundred years humans will be able to travel to the inner planets of the solar system and in 500 years we will have visited the nearest stars.Breakthrough Starshot- What are the prospects that scientists will unite Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum theory to achieve a complete theory of the laws of the universe?This will happen within the next millennium. - Will human genetic engineering occur?Yes. If scientists learn how to do something, SOMEONE will do it.....even if it's illegal. - Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?Yes. Computers are likely to overtake human intelligence in the next 100 years. Thus we need to ensure that computers have goals in line with ours. Just to be safe, robotic designs should always incorporate a 'kill switch.'- What world changing idea would you like to see implemented by humanity? The development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy. It would be an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming. *****Despite everything, Hawking was an optimistic soul. He advocates that we should: “Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done."" I found the book interesting and informative and would recommend it to people interested in Hawking's view of the 'big questions.'You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
35,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"Well, this was certainly a bitter-sweet read, knowing it is the last book of Steven Hawking. I wish I'd borrowed the e-book instead of the print because there are so many things I'd have loved to highlight. In Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Stephen Hawking attempts to answer 10 big questions, such as: •How did the universe begin?•Is there a god?•What is inside a black hole?•Is it possible to time travel?•Will AI outsmart us and if so, should we be worried?These and other questions are answered with brief, simple explanations. Steven Hawking's brilliance shines through on every page. His wittiness is prevalent throughout the book as well (including some wonderful jabs at Donnie-johnnie Trump. Suffice it to say, Mr. Hawking was not a fan!).I absolutely loved this book. I only wish it could have been longer. Steven Hawking was such a gift to humanity, his genius will live on for as long as there is intelligent life to appreciate his many contributions. I am so sad to have finished this book, but so glad to have read it.
""This is not the end of the story, but just the beginning of what I hope will be billions of years of life flourishing in the cosmos.”

36,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25398561-andr-oliveira,5,"In this book Stephen Hawking, possibly the last book written by him, answers some big questions and makes some predictions for the future taking into account the current state of science. How did it all begin? Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Is time travel possible? Obviously, I wasn't expecting solutions for these questions, but Stephen Hawking is able to explain complicated questions in a way that everyone would understand. Also, I love how Stephen Hawking answers those questions without disregarding other's beliefs.

""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

Would you hope anyone would turn up?Hawking’s answer: In 2009 I held a party for time travelers in my college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge, for a film about time travel. To ensure that only genuine time travelers came, I didn’t send out the invitation until after the party. On the day of the party, I sat in college, hoping but no one came. I was disappointed, but not surprised, because I had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is positive, time travel is not possible. I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong.”In “Brief Answers to the Big Questions – The Final Book” by Stephen Hawking.I'm not really asking a question - a lot of what Hawking talks about really isn't even theoretically testable. Theoretical physics does tend in that direction - often it talks about ideas that are not testable yet, and may not be for a long time, or which are mathematical speculation as much as observation."

39,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Part of the legacy of an exceptional genius, a source of inspiration and a science communicator.Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Hawking understood how to use his life in many ways in exemplary fashion, despite his adverse health, and to research with full vigor. He was an inspiration to millions of people despite all the restrictions. And he used the nimbus as a genius, who is caged in his body, to achieve that goal. The press loved Hawking and he played with the media channels like a virtuoso. He was for understandable and entertaining science journalism away from the academic ivory tower. Far away from academics who fail because of their inability to explain their theses understandably and rousingly. And feast themselves on their lonely genius instead. Hawking wanted to make science accessible to the masses of people, fueling joy and enthusiasm, inspiring a new generation of researchers. Like other visionaries like Neil de Grasse Tyson, Carl Sagan and many others. The generation of bloggers known in the new media, Youtubers, etc. is inspired by him too.His unusual life enabled him to gain a reputation he probably would never have attained to that extent. And he was an inspiring model to all procrastinating, passive, blaming, quarreling, ... people in the affluent societies. How ridiculous is it when healthy people wallow in their self-pity or are unable to control their emotions. A quick look at the philanthropy and kindness of an exceptional explorer like Hawking would suffice. To shamefully take consequences and prioritize self-discipline, in order not to stagnate further.Concerning the ideological aspects of Hawking's work, every reader has to find his own approach. Depending on one´s preferred beliefs, agnosticism, atheism, nihilism, pastafarianism, ... his interpretations have a different status. Hawking's metaphysical hypotheses permeate his work and are relevant to readers who are not only interested in pure science. As well as his political analyzes and warnings.In addition to inspirational quotes, Hawking also left warnings of various, future dangers. Both should be used in the sense of a productive use of his legacy. The wisdom of his mantras and the pessimism of his warnings of AI and alien intelligences.The safety of AI depends on two factors: human competence and computer security. That sounds very frightening, but it should work in practice because a lot of infrastructures depends on it. Although similar thoughts revolved around the safety of nuclear weapons: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...But as long as capable programmers implement sufficient security mechanisms to never provide the AI with too much power and access rights, this danger is eliminated. And if these KIs are sufficiently protected against infiltration and sabotage, its fatal manipulation and misappropriation can be prevented. The only problem is that autonomous physical and purely virtual weapons systems need a lot of self-sufficiency and networking to work ""well."" Like all logistical, economic and process engineering applications. This will be a balancing act. Hopefully, nobody will stumble over the Terminator.The extraterrestrial intelligences are a different caliber and no approach is consistent. One can optimistically run to ruin or pessimistically pursue isolationism. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages. In Hawking's opinion, we would do well to behave as inconspicuously as possible and quietly evolve as quickly as possible. And in as little space as possible with fewer signals, emissions and detectable activities on just a few planets. This would entail restrictions on the use of new communications capabilities that are yet to be developed, space colonization, asteroid mining, and so on — all key technologies for the further development of humanity. For economic reasons, one will take all risks and expand as far as technically possible forever until it becomes clear which assumption was correct. There is a contradiction between Hawking's urge for space colonization with self-sufficient settlements with independent populations and his warning to be unobtrusive. Both are not possible at the same time. Humanity will gamble and hopefully win. The dangers of improving humans through genetic engineering and implants are small footnotes in relation to machine apocalypse or alien invasion. China has most likely already begun and everyone else will follow. As always, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Lapidar and soberly said, there were always hierarchies and society pyramids. It would be hypocritical now to pretend that immediate improvement and gene optimization would make a difference and break the taboo. Much ideology plays into it. The poverty that arises from the lack of distributive justice is the problem. And not whether the one human is breathing with gills underwater and lives 1000 years or forever and the other with fewer enhancements can only live 500 years and can afford a little less intelligence increase. There is no difference to today. For Hawking, the easily preventable diseases of civilization are incomprehensible. That so many people fail to get up regularly from sitting, eat less and move their lazy posteriors. Instead of just eating from 7 to 22 and not moving at all. Because it really is not rocket technology to get some ambitions not to die earlier because of stupid and preventable reasons. The criticized hostility to science will become another embarrassing footnote in history. One just has to sit out the time and mindfully avoid dealing with such channels. Prefer to actively participate in the dissemination of knowledge and the passing of the torch to the youth. Because with personified stupidity, ignorance, counseling resistance and lack of learning ability cannot be discussed. Therefore, it would be lost love and waste of time even to seek dialogue with such individuals engaging in those political agendas. Neither of both sides would benefit from it. It´s just a great pity that problems such as declining biodiversity, environmental degradation, global warming,… can only be resolved by a common consensus.Especially now that research is opening up more doors than ever before, a healthy mix of caution and curiosity is required. One never knows what one awakens. Be it in machines, unstoppable processes or in the vastness of space.Ein Teil des Vermächtnisses eines Jahrhundertgenies, einer Inspirationsquelle und Wissenschaftskommunikators.Hawking verstand es, sein Leben trotz widrigen Gesundheitszustandes in vielfacher Weise vorbildhaft zu nutzen und voller Elan zu forschen. Er war trotz aller Einschränkungen eine Inspiration für Millionen Menschen. Und er nutzte den Nimbus als in seinem Körper eingesperrtes Genie geschickt, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Die Presse liebte Hawking und er spielte auf ihre wie ein Virtuose.Er war für einen verständlichen und unterhaltsamen Wissenschaftsjournalismus abseits vom akademischen Elfenbeinturm. Weit weg von Akademikern, die an der Unfähigkeit scheitern, ihre Thesen verständlich und mitreißend erklären zu können. Und sich stattdessen an ihrem einsamen Genie ergötzen. Hawking wollte Wissenschaft für die breite Masse der Menschen zugänglich machen, Freude und Begeisterung schüren und damit eine neue Generation von Forschern inspirieren. Wie andere Visionäre wie Neil de GrasseTyson, Carl Sagan und viele andere. Auch die Generation der in den neuen Medien bekannten Blogger, Youtuber, etc. ist von ihm inspiriert. Sein ungewöhnliches Leben ermöglichte es ihm, eine Bekanntheit zu erlangen, die er so wahrscheinlich nie in diesem Ausmaß erlangt hätte. Und er war für alle prokrastinierenden, passiven, anderen die Schuld zuschiebenden, hadernden,…Menschen in den Wohlstandsgesellschaften ein Mahnmal. Denn wie lächerlich ist es, wenn gesunde Menschen sich in ihrem eigenen Selbstmitleid suhlen oder unfähig sind, ihre Emotionen zu kontrollieren. Dabei würde ein kurzer Blick auf die Philantrophie und Güte eines Ausnahmeforschers wie Hawking genügen. Um peinlich berührt Konsequenz und Selbstdisziplin zu forcieren, um nicht weiter zu stagnieren.Hinsichtlich der ideologischen Aspekte in Hawkings Werk muss jeder Leser seine eigene Herangehensweise finden. Je nach präferierten Glauben, Agnostizismus, Atheismus, Nihilismus, Pastafarismus,… haben sie einen anderen Stellenwert. Hawkings metaphysische Hypothesen durchziehen sein Werk und sind für Leser relevant, die nicht nur an der reinen Naturwissenschaft interessiert sind. Gleich wie auch seine politischen Analysen und Warnungen. Neben inspirierenden Zitaten hinterließ Hawking auch Warnungen vor diversen, zukünftigen Gefahren. Im Sinne einer fruchtbaren Nutzung seines Vermächtnisses sollte beides genutzt werden. Die Weisheit seiner Mantras und der Pessimismus seiner Warnungen vor KIs und außerirdischen Intelligenzen.Die Sicherheit von KIs hängt an 2 Faktoren: menschlicher Kompetenz und Computersicherheit. Das klingt sehr erschreckend, dürfte in der Praxis aber funktionieren, weil viel Infrastruktur daran hängt. Obwohl man das bei Kernwaffen auch dachte: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...Aber solange fähige Programmierer ausreichende Sicherheitsmechanismen einbauen, um die KI nie mit zu viel Machtfülle und Zugriffsrechten auszustatten, ist diese Gefahr ausgeräumt. Und wenn diese KIs ausreichend vor Infiltration und Sabotage geschützt sind, lässt sich ihre fatale Manipulation und Zwecksentfremdung verhindern. Das Problem ist nur, dass autonome physische und rein virtuelle Waffensysteme viel Autarkie und Vernetzung benötigen, um ""gut"" funktionieren zu können. Wie auch alle logistischen, wirtschaftlichen und prozesstechnischen Anwendungen. Das wird ein Balanceakt werden, bei dem hoffentlich niemand über den Terminator stolpert. Die außerirdischen Intelligenzen sind ein anderes Kaliber und kein Lösungsansatz ist konsistent. Grundsätzlich kann man optimistisch ins Verderben rennen oder pessimistisch Isolationismus betreiben. Jede Option hat für sich Vorteile und Nachteile. Nach Hawkings Meinung täten wir gut daran, uns möglichst unauffällig zu verhalten und still und heimlich möglichst schnell weiter zu evolvieren. Und das auf so wenig Raum wie möglich mit so wenig Signalen, Emissionen und detektierbaren Aktivitäten wie möglich. Das würde Einschränkungen bei dem Einsatz neuer, noch zu entwickelnder Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten, Weltraumkolonisation, Asteroidenbergbau, usw. mit sich bringen. Alles Schlüsseltechnologien für die weitere Entwicklung der Menschheit. Man wird aus ökonomischen Gründen alle Risiken eingehen und so weit wie technisch möglich expandieren. Bis sich zeigt, welche Annahme richtig war. Es besteht ein Widerspruch zwischen Hawkings drängen auf eine Weltraumkolonisation mit autarken Siedlungen mit ausreichender Population und seiner Warnung. Die Gefahren der Verbesserung des Menschen mittels Gentechnik und Implantaten sind in Relation zu Maschinenapokalypse oder einer Alieninvasion kleine Fußnoten. China hat sehr wahrscheinlich längst damit begonnen und alle anderen werden folgen. Wie immer, ""It´s the economy, stupid."" Lapidar und nüchtern gesagt gab es immer Hierarchien und Gesellschaftspyramiden. Es wäre jetzt scheinheilig, so zu tun als würde unmittelbare Verbesserung und Optimierung einen Unterschied machen und einen ach so großen Tabubruch darstellen. Viel Ideologie spielt da mit hinein. Die Armut, die aus der mangelnden Verteilungsgerechtigkeit erwächst, ist das Problem. Und nicht, ob der eine Mensch mit Kiemen unter Wasser atmen und 1000 Jahre alt werden und der andere ""nur"" halb so alt wird und sich etwas weniger Intelligenzsteigerung leisten kann.Nicht nachvollziehbar sind für Hawking die so leicht zu verhindernden Zivilisationskrankheiten. Dass so viele Menschen es nicht schaffen, regelmäßig vom Sitzen aufzustehen, weniger zu essen und sich zu bewegen. Anstatt nur zu essen und sich gar nicht zu bewegen. Denn es ist wirklich keine Raketentechnik. Die von ihm kritisierte Wissenschaftsfeindlichkeit wird eine weitere peinliche Fußnote in der Geschichte werden. Man muss die Zeit nur aussitzen und achtsam den Umgang mit derartigen Kanälen meiden. Lieber aktiv an der Verbreitung von Wissen und dem Reichen der Fackel an die Jugend partizipieren. Denn mit Dummheit, Ignoranz, Beratungsresistenz und mangelnder Lernfähigkeit lässt sich nicht diskutieren. Deswegen wäre es verlorene Liebemühe und Zeitverschwendung, mit solchen Individuen und politischen Strömungen überhaupt einen Dialog zu suchen. Keine der Parteien hätte davon irgendeinen Nutzen. Blöd nur, dass Probleme wie zurück gehende Biodiversität, Umweltzerstörung und Klimaerwärmung nur auf Basis eines gemeinsamen Konsens gelöst werden können.Gerade jetzt, wo die Forschung so viele Türen aufstößt wie noch nie, ist eine gesunde Mischung aus Vorsicht und Neugierde angesagt. Man weiß nie, was man weckt. Sei es in Maschinen, nicht mehr aufzuhaltenden Prozessen oder in den Weiten des Alls."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

★ This is the book that I decided to start my year with and I am glad that I did so. I have been meaning to read more non-fiction and more science books and I believe that this was a very good choice! It was my first exposure to Hawking as an author and I certainly want to read his other book (which I already own) later this year.★ As the name implies, the book asks ten grand questions and then try to answer them briefly and simply and if you are curious to what these questions are then here is a small list of them:1. Is there a God?2. How did it all begin?3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe?4. Can we predict the future?5. What is inside a black hole?6. Is time travel possible?7. Will we survive on Earth?8. Should we colonize space?9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?10. How do we shape the future?★ I think there are 2 things regarding those questions and answers that I should mention and that you should know if you ever decided that you want to read the book: The first thing is that the author does not hold back and he tries to explain everything and he sometimes opposes the religion so you have to read this with an open-mind. The second thing is that the language was scientific but it was as simple as it could be. I have to be honest and admit that I did not understand 100% of what was written as I am also not a physicists but a physician! I think that it is okay though because it was written by one of the world’s smartest authors (quite literally) and I am not one of the world’s smartest readers!★ I found this book to be real eye-opening and it made me ask questions, it has been 2 weeks since I finished it but I am still thinking about it! The way the questions were tackled was very logical and you could tell Hawking knows how we think! I was amazed by how humble and funny he was as a human being (Even when he addressed his personal life and health issues) and the journey through this book was really inspiring! I may not agree with all his ideas but I sure respect him as a human and as a man of science!

“While there’s life, there is hope.”

★ Summary: If you are looking for a great science non-fiction book then do no more because Stephen Hawking got you covered with his last book! The book answers ten questions although sometimes it spins in circle before doing so. The writing was easier than expected and the book was a pleasant surprise! I have already recommended it to a couple of friends and I know it will be the catalyst to a few heated-debates with said friends! R.I.P. Stephen Hawking!You can get more books from Book Depository"
41,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"This is my first book of 2019. As a thought-provoking book from one of the leading thinkers till recent times, a good way to start the year. I have previously read his “A brief history of time” and “The grand design” both of which I liked for presenting serious science in a very readable form. This book released after Stephen Hawking’s death does not disappoint, and is a great compilation of the most important topics Hawking dealt with in his lifetime – and these topics are also those most of us are extremely curious about. There are a couple of good forewords from Eddie Redmayne who played him in the movie “The theory of everything” and scientist Kip Thorne, who writes of his inspiration from Stephen Hawking’s life on his work on gravitational waves. The afterword by his daughter Lucy is touching including mentioning the impact he had on people as could be seen by the large crowds which quietly lined the street on his passing. The first topic in the is – “Is there a God?”. Hawking’s views on this are already public, and also included in the movie based on his life. The point he makes is that religion describes God as some kind of a superhuman whom we can discuss/debate with and be judged by (some traditions such as Advaita Vedanta do not do that though). He goes on to discuss how time itself started with the big bang and the universe, and well-defined laws of nature mean there is nothing for a God to do. You may agree, partly agree or disagree with his views, but he certainly offers a lot of food for thought. The next topic is on how it all started with the big bang. While all the answers are yet not there, Hawking is confident that physics will crack the puzzle of how the universe sprang from nothing. There is already a lot of progress made such as with M-theory. The section on black holes is probably the most detailed and it is also a bit dense in parts. This is probably the area Stephen Hawking has contributed the most, and I suppose that explains the level of detail. The discussion is fascinating – do black holes retain context and information of what goes in? How do they come about, and how can study them?In the discussions around climate change, and in fleeting references in other sections as well, Hawking stresses that we are being very irresponsible with respect to Planet Earth, and people in power had better pay attention to this. The other sections on space travel, AI make for interesting reading as well.This book is certainly a tribute to Stephen Hawking’s curiosity, passion for science and intellectual genius. A great book to start the year – very intellectually stimulating.My rating: 4.5 / 5."
42,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59094974-ladan,4,"Brilliant, wise, fun, and simple! yet a bit repetitive.---------------------------------------Just imagine Hawking was your teacher at school, were you going to pick the same major? were you doing the same job you have now? were you looking at the universe the same way you have been looking so far? I have a pile of friends who have grown a hatred for science merely because of the fact that their teachers couldn't simply explain and illuminate the stuff that Hawking has covered in his books. In this book, he answers 10 questions and some of them have been brought up in his other books, yet this book is the extract of his work and could be recommended to anyone who wants to start reading Hawking. I have summarized the first two questions in the following pic, which were the most important ones to me. The rest of the questions somehow depend on humans and their behaviour, which I personally am so pessimist about.I would love to be as hopeful as Hawking, but let's get real, take a look around, no promising sign! Look at the role models of younger generations, look at the number of followers on Kim Kardashian's Instagram page... I mean seriously 150 million people?? man this fucked up world is doomed! Even Hawking's dead :( matching soundtrack:day one/Hans ZimmerP.s: I almost got 10 years older due to reuploading the pic, I can't help it, if you want a high-quality one just let me know"
43,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,4,"""Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""I loved loved loved this book. I have always been fascinated by science and astronomy and I have never read anything by Stephen Hawking, and this book was absolutely fascinating and thought provoking to me. I loved hearing his theories about our future and I agree with a lot about what he has to say about religion and how human fascination with science and space travel is so important for our future. I really agree with that statement about having all our eggs in one basket and how it's important for us to find a new home.Here is an amazing quote where Stephen Hawking explains better than I could ever attempt to why I'm not a religious person: “Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion. Religion was an early attempt to answer the questions we all ask: why are we here, where did we come from? Long ago, the answer was almost always the same: gods made everything. The world was a scary place, so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning, storms or eclipses. Nowadays, science provides better and more consistent answers, but people will always cling to religion, because it gives comfort, and they do not trust or understand science.” I loved this book. I will admit some if it went way over my head with the mathematics and equations and quantum physics but I did my best and I feel like I learned a lot while reading this. RIP Stephen Hawking."
44,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Having always had much admiration for the way Stephen Hawking has lived his life, overcoming adversity to become one of the brightest stars in our sky (pun absolutely intended), I was intrigued to see what his last contribution would bring with it. One of the things I most appreciate about him and his books is that he makes often complex and complicated topics accessible to everyday individuals such as myself - those without a background or degree in the sciences, and here he explores some of the biggest and most important unanswered questions (hence the title) in a way that is understandable to all and doesn't require expert or previous knowledge on said topics.I am sad that no more of his fantastic works can now be published, and I have huge respect for him as although he certainly had some challenging obstacles to overcome he has contributed so much to what we now know which is more than most of us will achieve in this life - the word inspirational is what immediately comes to mind. A thoroughly engaging, intriguing and enjoyable romp through Hawking's opinion on age-old, philosophical questions right through to some of those at the forefront of current affairs. Rest in peace, Professor Hawking!"
45,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,5,One of the best pop-science books I've ever read. Wonderful afterword by his daughter. Black holes are cool as shit.
46,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58356782-bryan,5,"A total page-turner, this book is quite remarkable it gives you a sense of a personal interview between Dr. Hawking and the reader. The Big questions are:Is there a God?How did it all begin?Is time travel possible?What is inside of a black hole?Is there other intelligent life in the universe?Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?How do we shape the future?Should we colonize space?Can we predict the future?Will we survive on earth? I highly recommend this book."
47,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Even though the book was meant to be as exoteric as possible, it is still rather thorough for the general public. To me, the answers were prolix and discursive. Much explaining was done, but I often found myself asking ""How's that relevant to the question?""."
48,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96756984-yesenia-juarez,5,"I have always heard of Stephen Hawking growing up but I have never read into him. This man is all the hype! Wow, this book gave me chills every 30 mins. I’m convinced my IQ is 3 in comparison to his 160. Amazing!!!!"
49,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,5,"Just as I finished reading Brief Answers to the Big Questions this morning, the power came on again. It had been off since 08:00 to about 12:00, and also from 09:00 to 00:00 last night, in what our South African electricity utility Eskom terms ‘load shedding’ (Stage 2). Due to unplanned breakdowns in its generating capacity, the utility effectively institutes rolling blackouts across the country to reduce peak demand, and to ultimately avoid a total system collapse, following which it will take weeks to restore the national grid.Local municipalities do institute a load-shedding schedule so that we as residents can prepare, but these are invariably outdated or inaccurate. In addition, the electricity supply situation is so volatile it can change faster than you can say ‘lightbulb’ (one night in December we hit a new record of Stage 6 load-shedding, with all the schedules now updated to accommodate up to an ominous-sounding Stage 8.)What does this have to do with Stephen Hawking’s book? In Part 10, ‘How Do We Shape The Future?’, Hawking’s response to what his ‘world-changing idea’ would be is quite simple, and drolly amusing in our own context: “… the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy …”In South Africa, The Powers That Be have deemed that coal-fired power stations are still the way to go, with the State-owned electricity actively legislating against independent power producers and renewable energy due to a perceived threat of competition, and our plentiful supply of cheap coal (a classic monopoly situation, though this is changing as the wheels now start to come off.)What is holding us back in South Africa at this precise point in time? Politics; and self-serving politicians. With the ruling party’s grip on complete power being slowly eroded, and every day bringing more damning news of State capture of the essential organs of government, patronage, and systemic corruption, there is such a bun fight at the moment that everything else that really matters – such as functioning infrastructure and economic growth – go out the window as political fat cats jockey and squabble for their privileged position at the public trough.Ideally, what our electricity utility should do is bring in external experts to conduct a thorough audit of its generating capacity, what the precise technical and coal-supply issues are, and then to devise a proper timetable that can be adhered to, budgeted and costed for, and then also give us a much-needed light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.But as Hawking himself warns in this brilliant book, there is an alarming revolt against expertise in general and science in particular engulfing the world as nationalism and prejudice increase inexorably: “With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.”Hawking calls for a renewed faith in science, as it were, in order to harness the power of technology to solve our current problems, which are alarming in their severity and potential to become exponentially worse. The main issues here, of course, are climate change, the burgeoning global population, and how to ensure dignity and a reasonable quality of life for all.I loved this incredible book, which I think is such a fitting tribute to the legacy of Stephen Hawking, both as a scientist, a teacher and influencer, a father, and a husband. Perhaps Hawking’s daunting physical struggle against his MLS is what influenced his ferocious tenacity in ferreting out scientific questions and implications that continue to have a profound impact on Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in the form of M-theory.From the provocative opening chapter entitled ‘Is There a God?’, the book provides a readily understandable (and equation-free) introduction to Hawking’s major scientific contributions. What I enjoyed the most though were the wide-ranging chapters towards the end, such as ‘Will We Survive on Earth?’ to ‘Should We Colonise Space?’ and ‘Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?’, to the thought-provoking and deeply personal final chapter, ‘How Do We Shape the Future?’In her Afterword, daughter Lucy Hawking reveals that her father knew about, and approved, of this book, which is effectively culled from a lifetime of writing and thinking. Even though it is heavily edited and condensed, the man’s impish humour, compassion, and innate grasp of the essence of any problem, so matter how large or small, is evident on every page.I was also fascinated to learn how Hawking’s legacy is continuing, in the form of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, and the Future of Life Institute. What delighted me equally is Hawking’s abiding love for science fiction. He comments intelligently and fondly on everything from Star Trek to Back to the Future and Interstellar. This is truly a book to cherish."

I get it, when someone with the stature of Hawking passes away, the demand for a book is there. And since I believe Hawking to be an extraordinary person, what objection could there be for this release? My main gripe is the editing. It's beyond my grasp how such a wide-spread book could be edited so poorly, making it feel rushed and cheap. There are a lot of sentences and entire paragraphs being repeated in different chapters. None of which feel right, they could've easily be skipped over or paraphrased in different ways. Other than that, this book gives people who were already familiar with Hawking's beliefs nothing new. Yet the book is very much about those beliefs. I would've understood the appeal of a more personal memoir as a quick posthumous work, but I'm not quite clear what the target audience is in this case.Despite all that, it's Hawking, it's inspiring, it's at times thought provoking. I think the final chapters concerning A.I., space colonisation and the problems humanity faces in this and coming centuries are where this work shines."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

Poignantly bookended by a beautifully written Foreword from Eddie Redmayne and a touching Afterword from his daughter, Lucy Hawking, this book is a collection of essays which attempt to answer some of the biggest questions rooted in science, and to an extent philosophy, posed to humankind. From the existence of God and other intelligent life in the universe, to time and space travel, and whether we will survive on Earth, or will artificial intelligence outsmart humans - Hawking's addressed these issues in his usual authentic, direct and honest manner. While there are some hard science smattered throughout the narrative, especially when the topic centred around cosmology, a substantial chunk of the writing can be easily comprehended without requiring a physics degree. I believe this is a book which should be read by everyone as it tackles some really pressing issues about the future of humanity. 

We spend a great deal of time studying history, which, let's face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it's a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence. We are aware of the potential dangers, but perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialisation.

One may think that this book is indeed what it looks like – a genius addressing big and teeny tiny little bit naïve questions that you and me are longing to ask, such as How Did It All Begin? Is There Other Intelligent Life In The Universe? Can We Predict Future? What Is Inside a Black Hole? Is Time Travel Possible? Will We Survive on Earth? and naturally following Should We Colonise Space? In reality, this book is bigger on the inside. It teaches us (again) to ask bold, big questions – something which seemed perfectly fine for us when we were children and makes us look like dilettantes uttering nonsense now. It kindly reminds us of our endless possibilities no matter how restricted by circumstances we feel. It shows us the infinite beauty of things which are much bigger than our understanding and much older that anything we can possibly imagine for comparison. It tells us stories of stars that died unbelievably long ago and stars that are living so far we most likely will never see them. It proves us why being ”scientifically literate” is important for our future and for the future of our children. And, first and foremost, it tells the story of a boy who passionately, without cease, asked questions and refused to believe in boundaries. Instead, he believed in endless possibilities if not of a single human being, then of the curious, smart and brave generations to come."

I took this one out from a library, but I liked it so much I bought a copy and intend to reread it in the near future. There are passages of beauty and awe throughout his scientific explanations. In addition to explaining the origins of the universe, Hawking described his own origins: ""I wanted to be a great scientist. However, I wasn't a very good student when I was at school, and was rarely more than halfway up my class... but I had good friends at school. And we talked about everything and, specifically, the origin of the universe. this is where my dream began..."" (p. 20).In answering the questions of our origins, Hawking argued:""I have no desire to offend anyone of faith, but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator.."" (p. 34). Hawking continued to explain his thoughts on the question of a afterlife: ""I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think when we die we return to dust. But there's a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life..."" (p. 38).Hawking warns of the dangers of nuclear weapons and climate change. Although he does not endorse genetic engineering of humans, he does warn that it is inevitable.In relation to our future as a species and the connection to technology Hawking writes: ""I believe the future of communication is brain-computer interfaces."" (p. 194). He expands: ""Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it."" (p. 196).There in his final paragraph, Hawking leaves us this memorable advice: ""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet."" (p. 211)."

His research and ideas have forever changed how we see and know the universe around us. His theories on Black Holes have changed Cosmology as much, or more, that the ground breaking works by Galileo and Einstein. His ideas and theories will effect his field forever but it is his personality and drive that we should also not forget. Despite being told in his early twenties that he wouldn't live more than another five years, due to Motor Neuron Disease, Hawking set forth and continued towards his educational, career, family and personal goals and lived another fifty years, succeeding even beyond his own wildest dreams.In this book, Hawking gives us his thoughts and ideas on ten ""big questions"" including; god, other intelligent life in the universe, time travel, the need to colonize space, and artificial intelligence. He writes in a manner that presents the science in a way that is both easy to understand and that shares his personal thoughts and feelings.Hawking pointed out that science is currently out of favor with the general public and that this will prove to be a large problem for both individuals and society as a whole.

Although it was published after his death, Hawking was involved in the editing process at the end of his life, but he didn't really finish it. Of course I recognized many pieces from ""A Brief History of Time"", the book for which Hawking is best known to the general public and which I read a few weeks ago. In that sense it did not offer me much new, except for the pieces that dealt with climate change and artificial intelligence.What is striking once again is the remarkable social involvement of Hawking (cf. the aforementioned themes), his humour and his openly professed optimism, which was based on a strong belief in science (he uses the word ‘belief’ explicitly). Just like in ""A Brief History"", his ability to clearly explain extremely difficult matters (on black holes for instance) is striking. The only regrettable, but at the same time unavoidable thing is that it is noticeable that this book consists of cutting and pasting from different sources. (2.5 stars)"

Simply for the very reason the something coming from the smartest men of the previous 2 generations would be overly complicated and beyond my understanding. What I discovered in this book is Steven Hawking was just a great man as we was a scientist, but an incredible teacher as well. His method of writing allows people like, who have a passing interest in but only a vacation of his ability in science to understand his work. This skill cannot be understated as if the most knowledgeable person in the world cannot comuninate their knowledge it is list with them. Sort of like sending it into a black hole. The book is easily readable, Hawking' s dry wit and sense of humour makes reading and learning from it a pleasure. The metaphors on this book allowed me to grasp the basics of even the most complicated theories easily. Though I differ from him from a belief perspective, I do respect his ideas and I think like any great teacher Hawking would have welcomed this difference of opinion as a show of curiosity towards finding the truth.I am sure his views, and more in-depth theories will go a long way towards solving many of the great world wide problems highlighted in this book that we face today.I would recommend this book to any. It is a great read, and I don't thing anyone can read this book without learning something from it or seeing something a different way. Also it give a great insight into Steven Hawking as a person for people who know him best or colleagues of his, but from his own writing style. He has a great sense of humour, and amazing determination. This is a great final word and goodbye to a man who's theories will inspire many and live on far into the future. One day some of these theories might even become scientific laws one day."

The article was illustrated. God was shown in a drawing by Michelangelo, looking thunderous. They printed a photo of me, looking smug. They made it look like a duel between us. But I don't have a grudge against God. I do not want to give the impression that my work is about proving or disproving the existence of God. My work is about finding a rational framework to understand the universe around us.Catechist, atheist, agnostic; I've been there. So naturally, my main interest in this book is that haunting question regarding the existence of a god, the creation of things. I had faith, I don't know where it went; perhaps a part of it went with the books I've read that made it impossible for me to absorb some notions without questioning them. I told a priest once and he looked at me as if I were selling drugs and tickets to strip clubs at school, not without expressing how presumptuous human beings are for wanting to know everything. A similar reaction is mentioned in this book.Needless remarks aside, a feeble faith tinged with fear - whereas it represents some obvious disadvantages - keeps the mind open. What do you have? The laws of nature or a self-existent and eternal being that created time and space. The complete absence of destiny or someone to blame for lousy decisions. The serenity of dust or the afterlife - on whichever side you get, because you believe or you don't. There is no wager here. There's a chance that an omniscient designer is going to notice that you're believing ""just in case"". I prefer the afterlife Hawking describes: 
wishful thinking.
 This scientist, key factor in singularities and father of Hawking Radiation, is also the master of analogies. The content of this book is a pedagogic challenge and yet, he makes it approachable. Some ideas and quotes appear more than once throughout the book (those already familiar with Hawking's work may be less enthusiastic about this) but I didn't mind; more resources for me to retain rather complex processes, while there's still light. Some of the Big Questions and one-sentence quotes:Is there a God?If you accept, as I do, that the laws of nature are fixed, then it doesn't take long to ask: what role is there for God?How did it all begin?We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe.Is there other intelligent life in the universe?I shall take this [intelligent life] to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid survival of the species.What is inside a black hole?Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science-fiction writers, but they are firmly matters of science fact.Is time travel possible?
There was a young lady of Wight Who travelled much faster than lightShe departed one day In a relative way And arrived on the previous night.
How do we shape the future?If you know how something works, you can control it.The book includes comments of those who knew Hawking:

“While there’s life, there is hope.” 

Stephen Hawking was such an inspirational man. When he first received his diagnosis, he was ready to give up on life; he was ready to abandon his studies as his body slowly diminished, but with the help of a few friends and loved ones he managed to carry on and complete his work. And, to his surprise, he carried on living beyond what he thought was capable. So, he made the most of every moment as he pursued his academic goals. 

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

He truly was a great man. And the best thing about this book is its simplicity. Stephen Hawking is not dealing with simple things here; he is dealing with complexities that he has spent his life researching and pondering over. Yet, for all that, he makes it approachable and readable to the everyday reader. He knows his audience, and he writes for them, which is fantastic because with a book like this one could easily have become alienated. He was the leading expert in his field of theoretical physics, but he knew exactly how to communicate his ideas to the public.And that is so important. He considers huge questions in this book. Questions about time travel and alternate universes, but he discusses them in a friendly way. Anybody could read this without getting lost. I really do recommend this one. It’s a book that will make you think, and it’s a book that will make you appreciate one of the greatest scientists of his generation."
64,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Stephen HawkingStephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist who's considered one of the most brilliant scientists since Albert Einstein. In addition to making huge contributions to physics, Hawking strove to share his discoveries with the general public, and his book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a best seller. Moreover, Hawking did most of his research while battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which makes his accomplishments even more remarkable. In 'Brief Answers to Big Questions', completed after Hawking's death (from his speeches, interviews, essays, notes and lectures), the gifted scientist responds to a number of queries that are relevant to our time. However it's Hawking's QUESTIONS about relativity and quantum mechanics that will resonate going forward. In the introduction to this book, American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne writes: ""Newton gave us answers, Hawking gave us questions. And Hawking's questions themselves keep on giving, generating breakthroughs decades later. When ultimately we master the quantum gravity laws and comprehend fully the birth of our universe it may largely be by standing on the shoulders of Hawking.""Kip Thorne is an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. One of Hawking's most important contributions to science was his discovery of 'Hawking Radiation', composed of particles emitted from black holes. It was once thought that NOTHING could escape from a black hole, but this isn't the case. The idea goes as follows: Quantum mechanics implies that space is filled with particles and anti-particles - which are constantly appearing in pairs, separating, them coming together again and annihilating each other. In the presence of a black hole one member of the pair may fall into the black hole, leaving the other member without a partner to engage in mutual annihilation. This particle (or anti-particle) may escape as 'radiation' from the black hole. Sketches depicting Hawking RadiationScientists speculate that, unless a black hole gains mass (by engulfing other objects), it will eventually vanish.*****In this book Hawking answers questions he's been asked over the years. I'll give a brief synopsis of his responses, and leave you to read the book if you want more information.- Is there a God?No. Everything can be explained by the laws of nature. Matter and energy and space were spontaneously created by the Big Bang. - What came before the Big Bang?This is a meaningless question because there was no 'before' the Big Bang. Time (actually spacetime) was created BY the Big Bang. It's like asking 'what is south of the South Pole?'Spacetime (which is warped by the presence of solid matter) was formed by the Big Bang There's no 'south' of the South Pole- Is there other intelligent life in the universe?We don't know (yet) but Hawking likes to think there are other forms of intelligent life out there. They just haven't contacted Earth....perhaps because they're too far away. In any case, meeting an advanced civilization would be unadvisable (for us). Remember European settlers and American Indians? If aliens came here it would be like the film 'Independence Day.' - Can we predict the future?No. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates that we can't know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same instant. Thus we can't predict what will happen to a particle (or things made of particles) at a future time. Hawking observes: “No matter how powerful a computer you have, if you put lousy data in you will get lousy predictions out.” - What is inside a black hole? A black hole - which is single point of infinite density - is a star that's exhausted its nuclear fuel and collapsed.....but no one REALLY knows what's inside.- Is time travel possible?Theoretically yes. If spacetime was warped enough to form a loop, time travel would be possible. However, it time travel WAS possible, someone from the future would probably have come back to visit us already. In 2009, Hawking held a party for time travelers in his college at Cambridge, for a film about time travel. No one came.😊- Will we survive on Earth?Not forever. Nuclear war is a dire threat and there will be a meteorite strike at some point. Moreover, global warming is likely to make Earth uninhabitable, since our climate could become like that of Venus - boiling hot and raining sulfuric acid."" Hawking notes: ""One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will, therefore, survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a race.""- Should we colonize space?Yes. In order to survive long term, humans need to colonize other planets. This won't be cheap. Hawking helped initiate a research and engineering project called 'Breakthrough Starshot"", which strives to develop spacecraft capable of reaching the star system Alpha Centauri - which is 4.37 light-years (about 26 trillion miles) away. Hawking believes that in the next hundred years humans will be able to travel to the inner planets of the solar system and in 500 years we will have visited the nearest stars.Breakthrough Starshot- What are the prospects that scientists will unite Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum theory to achieve a complete theory of the laws of the universe?This will happen within the next millennium. - Will human genetic engineering occur?Yes. If scientists learn how to do something, SOMEONE will do it.....even if it's illegal. - Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?Yes. Computers are likely to overtake human intelligence in the next 100 years. Thus we need to ensure that computers have goals in line with ours. Just to be safe, robotic designs should always incorporate a 'kill switch.'- What world changing idea would you like to see implemented by humanity? The development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy. It would be an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming. *****Despite everything, Hawking was an optimistic soul. He advocates that we should: “Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done."" I found the book interesting and informative and would recommend it to people interested in Hawking's view of the 'big questions.'You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."

Steven Hawking's brilliance shines through on every page. His wittiness is prevalent throughout the book as well (including some wonderful jabs at Donnie-johnnie Trump. Suffice it to say, Mr. Hawking was not a fan!).I absolutely loved this book. I only wish it could have been longer.

Would you hope anyone would turn up?Hawking’s answer: In 2009 I held a party for time travelers in my college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge, for a film about time travel. To ensure that only genuine time travelers came, I didn’t send out the invitation until after the party. On the day of the party, I sat in college, hoping but no one came. I was disappointed, but not surprised, because I had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is positive, time travel is not possible. I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong.”In “Brief Answers to the Big Questions – The Final Book” by Stephen Hawking.I'm not really asking a question - a lot of what Hawking talks about really isn't even theoretically testable.

He was an inspiration to millions of people despite all the restrictions. And he used the nimbus as a genius, who is caged in his body, to achieve that goal. The press loved Hawking and he played with the media channels like a virtuoso. He was for understandable and entertaining science journalism away from the academic ivory tower. Far away from academics who fail because of their inability to explain their theses understandably and rousingly. And feast themselves on their lonely genius instead. Hawking wanted to make science accessible to the masses of people, fueling joy and enthusiasm, inspiring a new generation of researchers. Like other visionaries like Neil de Grasse Tyson, Carl Sagan and many others. The generation of bloggers known in the new media, Youtubers, etc. is inspired by him too.His unusual life enabled him to gain a reputation he probably would never have attained to that extent. And he was an inspiring model to all procrastinating, passive, blaming, quarreling, ... people in the affluent societies. How ridiculous is it when healthy people wallow in their self-pity or are unable to control their emotions. A quick look at the philanthropy and kindness of an exceptional explorer like Hawking would suffice. To shamefully take consequences and prioritize self-discipline, in order not to stagnate further.Concerning the ideological aspects of Hawking's work, every reader has to find his own approach. Depending on one´s preferred beliefs, agnosticism, atheism, nihilism, pastafarianism, ... his interpretations have a different status. Hawking's metaphysical hypotheses permeate his work and are relevant to readers who are not only interested in pure science. As well as his political analyzes and warnings.In addition to inspirational quotes, Hawking also left warnings of various, future dangers. Both should be used in the sense of a productive use of his legacy. The wisdom of his mantras and the pessimism of his warnings of AI and alien intelligences.The safety of AI depends on two factors: human competence and computer security. That sounds very frightening, but it should work in practice because a lot of infrastructures depends on it. Although similar thoughts revolved around the safety of nuclear weapons: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...But as long as capable programmers implement sufficient security mechanisms to never provide the AI with too much power and access rights, this danger is eliminated. And if these KIs are sufficiently protected against infiltration and sabotage, its fatal manipulation and misappropriation can be prevented. The only problem is that autonomous physical and purely virtual weapons systems need a lot of self-sufficiency and networking to work ""well."" Like all logistical, economic and process engineering applications. This will be a balancing act. Hopefully, nobody will stumble over the Terminator.The extraterrestrial intelligences are a different caliber and no approach is consistent. One can optimistically run to ruin or pessimistically pursue isolationism. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages. In Hawking's opinion, we would do well to behave as inconspicuously as possible and quietly evolve as quickly as possible. And in as little space as possible with fewer signals, emissions and detectable activities on just a few planets. This would entail restrictions on the use of new communications capabilities that are yet to be developed, space colonization, asteroid mining, and so on — all key technologies for the further development of humanity. For economic reasons, one will take all risks and expand as far as technically possible forever until it becomes clear which assumption was correct. There is a contradiction between Hawking's urge for space colonization with self-sufficient settlements with independent populations and his warning to be unobtrusive. Both are not possible at the same time. Humanity will gamble and hopefully win. The dangers of improving humans through genetic engineering and implants are small footnotes in relation to machine apocalypse or alien invasion. China has most likely already begun and everyone else will follow. As always, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Lapidar and soberly said, there were always hierarchies and society pyramids. It would be hypocritical now to pretend that immediate improvement and gene optimization would make a difference and break the taboo. Much ideology plays into it. The poverty that arises from the lack of distributive justice is the problem. And not whether the one human is breathing with gills underwater and lives 1000 years or forever and the other with fewer enhancements can only live 500 years and can afford a little less intelligence increase. There is no difference to today. For Hawking, the easily preventable diseases of civilization are incomprehensible. That so many people fail to get up regularly from sitting, eat less and move their lazy posteriors. Instead of just eating from 7 to 22 and not moving at all. Because it really is not rocket technology to get some ambitions not to die earlier because of stupid and preventable reasons. The criticized hostility to science will become another embarrassing footnote in history. One just has to sit out the time and mindfully avoid dealing with such channels. Prefer to actively participate in the dissemination of knowledge and the passing of the torch to the youth. Because with personified stupidity, ignorance, counseling resistance and lack of learning ability cannot be discussed. Therefore, it would be lost love and waste of time even to seek dialogue with such individuals engaging in those political agendas. Neither of both sides would benefit from it. It´s just a great pity that problems such as declining biodiversity, environmental degradation, global warming,… can only be resolved by a common consensus.Especially now that research is opening up more doors than ever before, a healthy mix of caution and curiosity is required. One never knows what one awakens. Be it in machines, unstoppable processes or in the vastness of space.Ein Teil des Vermächtnisses eines Jahrhundertgenies, einer Inspirationsquelle und Wissenschaftskommunikators.Hawking verstand es, sein Leben trotz widrigen Gesundheitszustandes in vielfacher Weise vorbildhaft zu nutzen und voller Elan zu forschen. Er war trotz aller Einschränkungen eine Inspiration für Millionen Menschen. Und er nutzte den Nimbus als in seinem Körper eingesperrtes Genie geschickt, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Die Presse liebte Hawking und er spielte auf ihre wie ein Virtuose.Er war für einen verständlichen und unterhaltsamen Wissenschaftsjournalismus abseits vom akademischen Elfenbeinturm. Weit weg von Akademikern, die an der Unfähigkeit scheitern, ihre Thesen verständlich und mitreißend erklären zu können. Und sich stattdessen an ihrem einsamen Genie ergötzen. Hawking wollte Wissenschaft für die breite Masse der Menschen zugänglich machen, Freude und Begeisterung schüren und damit eine neue Generation von Forschern inspirieren. Wie andere Visionäre wie Neil de GrasseTyson, Carl Sagan und viele andere. Auch die Generation der in den neuen Medien bekannten Blogger, Youtuber, etc. ist von ihm inspiriert. Sein ungewöhnliches Leben ermöglichte es ihm, eine Bekanntheit zu erlangen, die er so wahrscheinlich nie in diesem Ausmaß erlangt hätte. Und er war für alle prokrastinierenden, passiven, anderen die Schuld zuschiebenden, hadernden,…Menschen in den Wohlstandsgesellschaften ein Mahnmal. Denn wie lächerlich ist es, wenn gesunde Menschen sich in ihrem eigenen Selbstmitleid suhlen oder unfähig sind, ihre Emotionen zu kontrollieren. Dabei würde ein kurzer Blick auf die Philantrophie und Güte eines Ausnahmeforschers wie Hawking genügen. Um peinlich berührt Konsequenz und Selbstdisziplin zu forcieren, um nicht weiter zu stagnieren.Hinsichtlich der ideologischen Aspekte in Hawkings Werk muss jeder Leser seine eigene Herangehensweise finden. Je nach präferierten Glauben, Agnostizismus, Atheismus, Nihilismus, Pastafarismus,… haben sie einen anderen Stellenwert. Hawkings metaphysische Hypothesen durchziehen sein Werk und sind für Leser relevant, die nicht nur an der reinen Naturwissenschaft interessiert sind. Gleich wie auch seine politischen Analysen und Warnungen. Neben inspirierenden Zitaten hinterließ Hawking auch Warnungen vor diversen, zukünftigen Gefahren. Im Sinne einer fruchtbaren Nutzung seines Vermächtnisses sollte beides genutzt werden. Die Weisheit seiner Mantras und der Pessimismus seiner Warnungen vor KIs und außerirdischen Intelligenzen.Die Sicherheit von KIs hängt an 2 Faktoren: menschlicher Kompetenz und Computersicherheit. Das klingt sehr erschreckend, dürfte in der Praxis aber funktionieren, weil viel Infrastruktur daran hängt. Obwohl man das bei Kernwaffen auch dachte: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...Aber solange fähige Programmierer ausreichende Sicherheitsmechanismen einbauen, um die KI nie mit zu viel Machtfülle und Zugriffsrechten auszustatten, ist diese Gefahr ausgeräumt. Und wenn diese KIs ausreichend vor Infiltration und Sabotage geschützt sind, lässt sich ihre fatale Manipulation und Zwecksentfremdung verhindern. Das Problem ist nur, dass autonome physische und rein virtuelle Waffensysteme viel Autarkie und Vernetzung benötigen, um ""gut"" funktionieren zu können. Wie auch alle logistischen, wirtschaftlichen und prozesstechnischen Anwendungen. Das wird ein Balanceakt werden, bei dem hoffentlich niemand über den Terminator stolpert. Die außerirdischen Intelligenzen sind ein anderes Kaliber und kein Lösungsansatz ist konsistent. Grundsätzlich kann man optimistisch ins Verderben rennen oder pessimistisch Isolationismus betreiben. Jede Option hat für sich Vorteile und Nachteile. Nach Hawkings Meinung täten wir gut daran, uns möglichst unauffällig zu verhalten und still und heimlich möglichst schnell weiter zu evolvieren. Und das auf so wenig Raum wie möglich mit so wenig Signalen, Emissionen und detektierbaren Aktivitäten wie möglich. Das würde Einschränkungen bei dem Einsatz neuer, noch zu entwickelnder Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten, Weltraumkolonisation, Asteroidenbergbau, usw. mit sich bringen. Alles Schlüsseltechnologien für die weitere Entwicklung der Menschheit. Man wird aus ökonomischen Gründen alle Risiken eingehen und so weit wie technisch möglich expandieren. Bis sich zeigt, welche Annahme richtig war. Es besteht ein Widerspruch zwischen Hawkings drängen auf eine Weltraumkolonisation mit autarken Siedlungen mit ausreichender Population und seiner Warnung. Die Gefahren der Verbesserung des Menschen mittels Gentechnik und Implantaten sind in Relation zu Maschinenapokalypse oder einer Alieninvasion kleine Fußnoten. China hat sehr wahrscheinlich längst damit begonnen und alle anderen werden folgen. Wie immer, ""It´s the economy, stupid."" Lapidar und nüchtern gesagt gab es immer Hierarchien und Gesellschaftspyramiden. Es wäre jetzt scheinheilig, so zu tun als würde unmittelbare Verbesserung und Optimierung einen Unterschied machen und einen ach so großen Tabubruch darstellen. Viel Ideologie spielt da mit hinein. Die Armut, die aus der mangelnden Verteilungsgerechtigkeit erwächst, ist das Problem. Und nicht, ob der eine Mensch mit Kiemen unter Wasser atmen und 1000 Jahre alt werden und der andere ""nur"" halb so alt wird und sich etwas weniger Intelligenzsteigerung leisten kann.Nicht nachvollziehbar sind für Hawking die so leicht zu verhindernden Zivilisationskrankheiten. Dass so viele Menschen es nicht schaffen, regelmäßig vom Sitzen aufzustehen, weniger zu essen und sich zu bewegen. Anstatt nur zu essen und sich gar nicht zu bewegen. Denn es ist wirklich keine Raketentechnik. Die von ihm kritisierte Wissenschaftsfeindlichkeit wird eine weitere peinliche Fußnote in der Geschichte werden. Man muss die Zeit nur aussitzen und achtsam den Umgang mit derartigen Kanälen meiden. Lieber aktiv an der Verbreitung von Wissen und dem Reichen der Fackel an die Jugend partizipieren. Denn mit Dummheit, Ignoranz, Beratungsresistenz und mangelnder Lernfähigkeit lässt sich nicht diskutieren. Deswegen wäre es verlorene Liebemühe und Zeitverschwendung, mit solchen Individuen und politischen Strömungen überhaupt einen Dialog zu suchen. Keine der Parteien hätte davon irgendeinen Nutzen. Blöd nur, dass Probleme wie zurück gehende Biodiversität, Umweltzerstörung und Klimaerwärmung nur auf Basis eines gemeinsamen Konsens gelöst werden können.Gerade jetzt, wo die Forschung so viele Türen aufstößt wie noch nie, ist eine gesunde Mischung aus Vorsicht und Neugierde angesagt. Man weiß nie, was man weckt. Sei es in Maschinen, nicht mehr aufzuhaltenden Prozessen oder in den Weiten des Alls."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

★ This is the book that I decided to start my year with and I am glad that I did so. I have been meaning to read more non-fiction and more science books and I believe that this was a very good choice! It was my first exposure to Hawking as an author and I certainly want to read his other book (which I already own) later this year.★ As the name implies, the book asks ten grand questions and then try to answer them briefly and simply and if you are curious to what these questions are then here is a small list of them:1. Is there a God?2. How did it all begin?3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe?4. Can we predict the future?5. What is inside a black hole?6. Is time travel possible?7. Will we survive on Earth?8. Should we colonize space?9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?10. How do we shape the future?★ I think there are 2 things regarding those questions and answers that I should mention and that you should know if you ever decided that you want to read the book: The first thing is that the author does not hold back and he tries to explain everything and he sometimes opposes the religion so you have to read this with an open-mind. The second thing is that the language was scientific but it was as simple as it could be. I have to be honest and admit that I did not understand 100% of what was written as I am also not a physicists but a physician! I think that it is okay though because it was written by one of the world’s smartest authors (quite literally) and I am not one of the world’s smartest readers!★ I found this book to be real eye-opening and it made me ask questions, it has been 2 weeks since I finished it but I am still thinking about it! The way the questions were tackled was very logical and you could tell Hawking knows how we think! I was amazed by how humble and funny he was as a human being (Even when he addressed his personal life and health issues) and the journey through this book was really inspiring! I may not agree with all his ideas but I sure respect him as a human and as a man of science!

“While there’s life, there is hope.”

★ Summary: If you are looking for a great science non-fiction book then do no more because Stephen Hawking got you covered with his last book! The book answers ten questions although sometimes it spins in circle before doing so. The writing was easier than expected and the book was a pleasant surprise! I have already recommended it to a couple of friends and I know it will be the catalyst to a few heated-debates with said friends! R.I.P. Stephen Hawking!You can get more books from Book Depository"
71,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"This is my first book of 2019. As a thought-provoking book from one of the leading thinkers till recent times, a good way to start the year. I have previously read his “A brief history of time” and “The grand design” both of which I liked for presenting serious science in a very readable form. This book released after Stephen Hawking’s death does not disappoint, and is a great compilation of the most important topics Hawking dealt with in his lifetime – and these topics are also those most of us are extremely curious about. There are a couple of good forewords from Eddie Redmayne who played him in the movie “The theory of everything” and scientist Kip Thorne, who writes of his inspiration from Stephen Hawking’s life on his work on gravitational waves. The afterword by his daughter Lucy is touching including mentioning the impact he had on people as could be seen by the large crowds which quietly lined the street on his passing. The first topic in the is – “Is there a God?”. Hawking’s views on this are already public, and also included in the movie based on his life. The point he makes is that religion describes God as some kind of a superhuman whom we can discuss/debate with and be judged by (some traditions such as Advaita Vedanta do not do that though). He goes on to discuss how time itself started with the big bang and the universe, and well-defined laws of nature mean there is nothing for a God to do. You may agree, partly agree or disagree with his views, but he certainly offers a lot of food for thought. The next topic is on how it all started with the big bang. While all the answers are yet not there, Hawking is confident that physics will crack the puzzle of how the universe sprang from nothing. There is already a lot of progress made such as with M-theory. The section on black holes is probably the most detailed and it is also a bit dense in parts. This is probably the area Stephen Hawking has contributed the most, and I suppose that explains the level of detail. The discussion is fascinating – do black holes retain context and information of what goes in? How do they come about, and how can study them?In the discussions around climate change, and in fleeting references in other sections as well, Hawking stresses that we are being very irresponsible with respect to Planet Earth, and people in power had better pay attention to this. The other sections on space travel, AI make for interesting reading as well.This book is certainly a tribute to Stephen Hawking’s curiosity, passion for science and intellectual genius. A great book to start the year – very intellectually stimulating.My rating: 4.5 / 5."
72,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59094974-ladan,4,"Brilliant, wise, fun, and simple! yet a bit repetitive.---------------------------------------Just imagine Hawking was your teacher at school, were you going to pick the same major? were you doing the same job you have now? were you looking at the universe the same way you have been looking so far? I have a pile of friends who have grown a hatred for science merely because of the fact that their teachers couldn't simply explain and illuminate the stuff that Hawking has covered in his books. In this book, he answers 10 questions and some of them have been brought up in his other books, yet this book is the extract of his work and could be recommended to anyone who wants to start reading Hawking. I have summarized the first two questions in the following pic, which were the most important ones to me. The rest of the questions somehow depend on humans and their behaviour, which I personally am so pessimist about.I would love to be as hopeful as Hawking, but let's get real, take a look around, no promising sign! Look at the role models of younger generations, look at the number of followers on Kim Kardashian's Instagram page... I mean seriously 150 million people?? man this fucked up world is doomed! Even Hawking's dead :( matching soundtrack:day one/Hans ZimmerP.s: I almost got 10 years older due to reuploading the pic, I can't help it, if you want a high-quality one just let me know"
73,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,4,"""Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""I loved loved loved this book. I have always been fascinated by science and astronomy and I have never read anything by Stephen Hawking, and this book was absolutely fascinating and thought provoking to me. I loved hearing his theories about our future and I agree with a lot about what he has to say about religion and how human fascination with science and space travel is so important for our future. I really agree with that statement about having all our eggs in one basket and how it's important for us to find a new home.Here is an amazing quote where Stephen Hawking explains better than I could ever attempt to why I'm not a religious person: “Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion. Religion was an early attempt to answer the questions we all ask: why are we here, where did we come from? Long ago, the answer was almost always the same: gods made everything. The world was a scary place, so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning, storms or eclipses. Nowadays, science provides better and more consistent answers, but people will always cling to religion, because it gives comfort, and they do not trust or understand science.” I loved this book. I will admit some if it went way over my head with the mathematics and equations and quantum physics but I did my best and I feel like I learned a lot while reading this. RIP Stephen Hawking."
74,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Having always had much admiration for the way Stephen Hawking has lived his life, overcoming adversity to become one of the brightest stars in our sky (pun absolutely intended), I was intrigued to see what his last contribution would bring with it. One of the things I most appreciate about him and his books is that he makes often complex and complicated topics accessible to everyday individuals such as myself - those without a background or degree in the sciences, and here he explores some of the biggest and most important unanswered questions (hence the title) in a way that is understandable to all and doesn't require expert or previous knowledge on said topics.I am sad that no more of his fantastic works can now be published, and I have huge respect for him as although he certainly had some challenging obstacles to overcome he has contributed so much to what we now know which is more than most of us will achieve in this life - the word inspirational is what immediately comes to mind. A thoroughly engaging, intriguing and enjoyable romp through Hawking's opinion on age-old, philosophical questions right through to some of those at the forefront of current affairs. Rest in peace, Professor Hawking!"
75,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,5,One of the best pop-science books I've ever read. Wonderful afterword by his daughter. Black holes are cool as shit.
76,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58356782-bryan,5,"A total page-turner, this book is quite remarkable it gives you a sense of a personal interview between Dr. Hawking and the reader. The Big questions are:Is there a God?How did it all begin?Is time travel possible?What is inside of a black hole?Is there other intelligent life in the universe?Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?How do we shape the future?Should we colonize space?Can we predict the future?Will we survive on earth? I highly recommend this book."
77,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Even though the book was meant to be as exoteric as possible, it is still rather thorough for the general public. To me, the answers were prolix and discursive. Much explaining was done, but I often found myself asking ""How's that relevant to the question?""."
78,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96756984-yesenia-juarez,5,"I have always heard of Stephen Hawking growing up but I have never read into him. This man is all the hype! Wow, this book gave me chills every 30 mins. I’m convinced my IQ is 3 in comparison to his 160. Amazing!!!!"
79,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,5,"Just as I finished reading Brief Answers to the Big Questions this morning, the power came on again. It had been off since 08:00 to about 12:00, and also from 09:00 to 00:00 last night, in what our South African electricity utility Eskom terms ‘load shedding’ (Stage 2). Due to unplanned breakdowns in its generating capacity, the utility effectively institutes rolling blackouts across the country to reduce peak demand, and to ultimately avoid a total system collapse, following which it will take weeks to restore the national grid.Local municipalities do institute a load-shedding schedule so that we as residents can prepare, but these are invariably outdated or inaccurate. In addition, the electricity supply situation is so volatile it can change faster than you can say ‘lightbulb’ (one night in December we hit a new record of Stage 6 load-shedding, with all the schedules now updated to accommodate up to an ominous-sounding Stage 8.)What does this have to do with Stephen Hawking’s book? In Part 10, ‘How Do We Shape The Future?’, Hawking’s response to what his ‘world-changing idea’ would be is quite simple, and drolly amusing in our own context: “… the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy …”In South Africa, The Powers That Be have deemed that coal-fired power stations are still the way to go, with the State-owned electricity actively legislating against independent power producers and renewable energy due to a perceived threat of competition, and our plentiful supply of cheap coal (a classic monopoly situation, though this is changing as the wheels now start to come off.)What is holding us back in South Africa at this precise point in time? Politics; and self-serving politicians. With the ruling party’s grip on complete power being slowly eroded, and every day bringing more damning news of State capture of the essential organs of government, patronage, and systemic corruption, there is such a bun fight at the moment that everything else that really matters – such as functioning infrastructure and economic growth – go out the window as political fat cats jockey and squabble for their privileged position at the public trough.Ideally, what our electricity utility should do is bring in external experts to conduct a thorough audit of its generating capacity, what the precise technical and coal-supply issues are, and then to devise a proper timetable that can be adhered to, budgeted and costed for, and then also give us a much-needed light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.But as Hawking himself warns in this brilliant book, there is an alarming revolt against expertise in general and science in particular engulfing the world as nationalism and prejudice increase inexorably: “With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.”Hawking calls for a renewed faith in science, as it were, in order to harness the power of technology to solve our current problems, which are alarming in their severity and potential to become exponentially worse. The main issues here, of course, are climate change, the burgeoning global population, and how to ensure dignity and a reasonable quality of life for all.I loved this incredible book, which I think is such a fitting tribute to the legacy of Stephen Hawking, both as a scientist, a teacher and influencer, a father, and a husband. Perhaps Hawking’s daunting physical struggle against his MLS is what influenced his ferocious tenacity in ferreting out scientific questions and implications that continue to have a profound impact on Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in the form of M-theory.From the provocative opening chapter entitled ‘Is There a God?’, the book provides a readily understandable (and equation-free) introduction to Hawking’s major scientific contributions. What I enjoyed the most though were the wide-ranging chapters towards the end, such as ‘Will We Survive on Earth?’ to ‘Should We Colonise Space?’ and ‘Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?’, to the thought-provoking and deeply personal final chapter, ‘How Do We Shape the Future?’In her Afterword, daughter Lucy Hawking reveals that her father knew about, and approved, of this book, which is effectively culled from a lifetime of writing and thinking. Even though it is heavily edited and condensed, the man’s impish humour, compassion, and innate grasp of the essence of any problem, so matter how large or small, is evident on every page.I was also fascinated to learn how Hawking’s legacy is continuing, in the form of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, and the Future of Life Institute. What delighted me equally is Hawking’s abiding love for science fiction. He comments intelligently and fondly on everything from Star Trek to Back to the Future and Interstellar. This is truly a book to cherish."
80,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"Extremely readable—on par with Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.Would revisit this one in the future as it's so short and interesting—very light on the physics.My favorite topic would have to be time travel, which Hawking believes is theoretically possible, but unlikely.This book was published 7 months after Hawking's death and was finished by his scientific colleagues, friends, and family using his writings, lectures, and notes. Included is a foreword from Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne, who played Hawking in the movie The Theory of Everything; an introduction by Nobel Prize-winning physicist and Hawking's lifelong friend, Kip Thorne; and a touching afterword from Hawking's daughter, Lucy.“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”"
81,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,3,"Dare I say this book felt like an unnecessary addition to Hawking's work this soon after his death? I get it, when someone with the stature of Hawking passes away, the demand for a book is there. And since I believe Hawking to be an extraordinary person, what objection could there be for this release? My main gripe is the editing. It's beyond my grasp how such a wide-spread book could be edited so poorly, making it feel rushed and cheap. There are a lot of sentences and entire paragraphs being repeated in different chapters. None of which feel right, they could've easily be skipped over or paraphrased in different ways. Other than that, this book gives people who were already familiar with Hawking's beliefs nothing new. Yet the book is very much about those beliefs. I would've understood the appeal of a more personal memoir as a quick posthumous work, but I'm not quite clear what the target audience is in this case.Despite all that, it's Hawking, it's inspiring, it's at times thought provoking. I think the final chapters concerning A.I., space colonisation and the problems humanity faces in this and coming centuries are where this work shines."
82,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"As the final parting gift from one of the modern legends of scientific genius and embodiment of human perseverance, I couldn't give this anything less than 5-stars. 

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

Poignantly bookended by a beautifully written Foreword from Eddie Redmayne and a touching Afterword from his daughter, Lucy Hawking, this book is a collection of essays which attempt to answer some of the biggest questions rooted in science, and to an extent philosophy, posed to humankind. From the existence of God and other intelligent life in the universe, to time and space travel, and whether we will survive on Earth, or will artificial intelligence outsmart humans - Hawking's addressed these issues in his usual authentic, direct and honest manner. While there are some hard science smattered throughout the narrative, especially when the topic centred around cosmology, a substantial chunk of the writing can be easily comprehended without requiring a physics degree. I believe this is a book which should be read by everyone as it tackles some really pressing issues about the future of humanity. 

We spend a great deal of time studying history, which, let's face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it's a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence. We are aware of the potential dangers, but perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialisation.

83,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75837977-sasha,5,One of the easiest 5 stars rate I had to give! I mean I loved it.While reading the book I was fascinated and intimated. Reading a tiny piece of his mind is and will always be fascinating! It was such an easy book to read. No need to be a science nerd like in The Big bang Theory to enjoy that book. He is easy to understand and should we talk about his sense of humour? I don't think so but I laughed so much!he was such an inspiration and will keep being an inspirational man...
84,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10499865-jack-chaucer,5,"A concise series of bold and sound conclusions from one of the most brave, expansive and beautiful minds this planet has ever produced. This guy traveled the universe for most of his life, despite being paralyzed in a wheelchair for much of it. He let nothing hold him back right through to his death in 2018. Check all religions and afterlife wishful thinking at the door with this book because they make no sense to Hawking based on the latest scientific discoveries. The departed scientist still had hope much more will be discovered, preferably from the next Einstein, wherever she might be."
85,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42124025-netta,5,"Mind-boggling and utterly moving book which is legitimately bigger-than-life as it contains black holes, space-time, time travels, dreamers, discoveries, wonders and, of course,  Star Trek. One may think that this book is indeed what it looks like – a genius addressing big and teeny tiny little bit naïve questions that you and me are longing to ask, such as How Did It All Begin? Is There Other Intelligent Life In The Universe? Can We Predict Future? What Is Inside a Black Hole? Is Time Travel Possible? Will We Survive on Earth? and naturally following Should We Colonise Space? In reality, this book is bigger on the inside. It teaches us (again) to ask bold, big questions – something which seemed perfectly fine for us when we were children and makes us look like dilettantes uttering nonsense now. It kindly reminds us of our endless possibilities no matter how restricted by circumstances we feel. It shows us the infinite beauty of things which are much bigger than our understanding and much older that anything we can possibly imagine for comparison. It tells us stories of stars that died unbelievably long ago and stars that are living so far we most likely will never see them. It proves us why being ”scientifically literate” is important for our future and for the future of our children. And, first and foremost, it tells the story of a boy who passionately, without cease, asked questions and refused to believe in boundaries. Instead, he believed in endless possibilities if not of a single human being, then of the curious, smart and brave generations to come."

I took this one out from a library, but I liked it so much I bought a copy and intend to reread it in the near future. There are passages of beauty and awe throughout his scientific explanations. In addition to explaining the origins of the universe, Hawking described his own origins: ""I wanted to be a great scientist. However, I wasn't a very good student when I was at school, and was rarely more than halfway up my class... but I had good friends at school. And we talked about everything and, specifically, the origin of the universe. this is where my dream began..."" (p. 20).In answering the questions of our origins, Hawking argued:""I have no desire to offend anyone of faith, but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator.."" (p. 34). Hawking continued to explain his thoughts on the question of a afterlife: ""I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think when we die we return to dust. But there's a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life..."" (p. 38).Hawking warns of the dangers of nuclear weapons and climate change. Although he does not endorse genetic engineering of humans, he does warn that it is inevitable.In relation to our future as a species and the connection to technology Hawking writes: ""I believe the future of communication is brain-computer interfaces."" (p. 194). He expands: ""Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it."" (p. 196).There in his final paragraph, Hawking leaves us this memorable advice: ""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet."" (p. 211)."
87,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""This is how Stephen Hawking lived his life and this is the message to the world he presents in Brief Answers To The Big Questions.Hawking was a genius. His research and ideas have forever changed how we see and know the universe around us. His theories on Black Holes have changed Cosmology as much, or more, that the ground breaking works by Galileo and Einstein. His ideas and theories will effect his field forever but it is his personality and drive that we should also not forget. Despite being told in his early twenties that he wouldn't live more than another five years, due to Motor Neuron Disease, Hawking set forth and continued towards his educational, career, family and personal goals and lived another fifty years, succeeding even beyond his own wildest dreams.In this book, Hawking gives us his thoughts and ideas on ten ""big questions"" including; god, other intelligent life in the universe, time travel, the need to colonize space, and artificial intelligence. He writes in a manner that presents the science in a way that is both easy to understand and that shares his personal thoughts and feelings.Hawking pointed out that science is currently out of favor with the general public and that this will prove to be a large problem for both individuals and society as a whole. He presents some ideas on how to get people more excited about both science and how it will effect the world. I think reading this book would be a good start."
88,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"This book has been compiled by daughter Lucy Hawking and contains an anthology of the most important popularizing work of her father Stephen. Although it was published after his death, Hawking was involved in the editing process at the end of his life, but he didn't really finish it. Of course I recognized many pieces from ""A Brief History of Time"", the book for which Hawking is best known to the general public and which I read a few weeks ago. In that sense it did not offer me much new, except for the pieces that dealt with climate change and artificial intelligence.What is striking once again is the remarkable social involvement of Hawking (cf. the aforementioned themes), his humour and his openly professed optimism, which was based on a strong belief in science (he uses the word ‘belief’ explicitly). Just like in ""A Brief History"", his ability to clearly explain extremely difficult matters (on black holes for instance) is striking. The only regrettable, but at the same time unavoidable thing is that it is noticeable that this book consists of cutting and pasting from different sources. (2.5 stars)"

Simply for the very reason the something coming from the smartest men of the previous 2 generations would be overly complicated and beyond my understanding. What I discovered in this book is Steven Hawking was just a great man as we was a scientist, but an incredible teacher as well. His method of writing allows people like, who have a passing interest in but only a vacation of his ability in science to understand his work. This skill cannot be understated as if the most knowledgeable person in the world cannot comuninate their knowledge it is list with them. Sort of like sending it into a black hole. The book is easily readable, Hawking' s dry wit and sense of humour makes reading and learning from it a pleasure. The metaphors on this book allowed me to grasp the basics of even the most complicated theories easily. Though I differ from him from a belief perspective, I do respect his ideas and I think like any great teacher Hawking would have welcomed this difference of opinion as a show of curiosity towards finding the truth.I am sure his views, and more in-depth theories will go a long way towards solving many of the great world wide problems highlighted in this book that we face today.I would recommend this book to any. It is a great read, and I don't thing anyone can read this book without learning something from it or seeing something a different way. Also it give a great insight into Steven Hawking as a person for people who know him best or colleagues of his, but from his own writing style. He has a great sense of humour, and amazing determination. This is a great final word and goodbye to a man who's theories will inspire many and live on far into the future. One day some of these theories might even become scientific laws one day."

Is time travel possible?Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?It was great - recommend the audiobook too!
92,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21575078-florencia,4,"A few years ago, The Times newspaper ran a headline on the front page which said 'Hawking: God Did Not Create Universe'. The article was illustrated. God was shown in a drawing by Michelangelo, looking thunderous. They printed a photo of me, looking smug. They made it look like a duel between us. But I don't have a grudge against God. I do not want to give the impression that my work is about proving or disproving the existence of God. My work is about finding a rational framework to understand the universe around us.Catechist, atheist, agnostic; I've been there. So naturally, my main interest in this book is that haunting question regarding the existence of a god, the creation of things. I had faith, I don't know where it went; perhaps a part of it went with the books I've read that made it impossible for me to absorb some notions without questioning them. I told a priest once and he looked at me as if I were selling drugs and tickets to strip clubs at school, not without expressing how presumptuous human beings are for wanting to know everything. A similar reaction is mentioned in this book.Needless remarks aside, a feeble faith tinged with fear - whereas it represents some obvious disadvantages - keeps the mind open. What do you have? The laws of nature or a self-existent and eternal being that created time and space. The complete absence of destiny or someone to blame for lousy decisions. The serenity of dust or the afterlife - on whichever side you get, because you believe or you don't. There is no wager here. There's a chance that an omniscient designer is going to notice that you're believing ""just in case"". I prefer the afterlife Hawking describes: 
wishful thinking.
 This scientist, key factor in singularities and father of Hawking Radiation, is also the master of analogies. The content of this book is a pedagogic challenge and yet, he makes it approachable. Some ideas and quotes appear more than once throughout the book (those already familiar with Hawking's work may be less enthusiastic about this) but I didn't mind; more resources for me to retain rather complex processes, while there's still light. Some of the Big Questions and one-sentence quotes:Is there a God?If you accept, as I do, that the laws of nature are fixed, then it doesn't take long to ask: what role is there for God?How did it all begin?We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe.Is there other intelligent life in the universe?I shall take this [intelligent life] to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid survival of the species.What is inside a black hole?Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science-fiction writers, but they are firmly matters of science fact.Is time travel possible?
There was a young lady of Wight Who travelled much faster than lightShe departed one day In a relative way And arrived on the previous night.
How do we shape the future?If you know how something works, you can control it.The book includes comments of those who knew Hawking: 
teacher, mentor and friend.

“While there’s life, there is hope.” 

Stephen Hawking was such an inspirational man. When he first received his diagnosis, he was ready to give up on life; he was ready to abandon his studies as his body slowly diminished, but with the help of a few friends and loved ones he managed to carry on and complete his work. And, to his surprise, he carried on living beyond what he thought was capable. So, he made the most of every moment as he pursued his academic goals. 

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

He truly was a great man. And the best thing about this book is its simplicity. Stephen Hawking is not dealing with simple things here; he is dealing with complexities that he has spent his life researching and pondering over. Yet, for all that, he makes it approachable and readable to the everyday reader. He knows his audience, and he writes for them, which is fantastic because with a book like this one could easily have become alienated. He was the leading expert in his field of theoretical physics, but he knew exactly how to communicate his ideas to the public.And that is so important. He considers huge questions in this book. Questions about time travel and alternate universes, but he discusses them in a friendly way. Anybody could read this without getting lost. I really do recommend this one. It’s a book that will make you think, and it’s a book that will make you appreciate one of the greatest scientists of his generation."
94,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Stephen HawkingStephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist who's considered one of the most brilliant scientists since Albert Einstein. In addition to making huge contributions to physics, Hawking strove to share his discoveries with the general public, and his book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a best seller. Moreover, Hawking did most of his research while battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which makes his accomplishments even more remarkable. In 'Brief Answers to Big Questions', completed after Hawking's death (from his speeches, interviews, essays, notes and lectures), the gifted scientist responds to a number of queries that are relevant to our time. However it's Hawking's QUESTIONS about relativity and quantum mechanics that will resonate going forward. In the introduction to this book, American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne writes: ""Newton gave us answers, Hawking gave us questions. And Hawking's questions themselves keep on giving, generating breakthroughs decades later. When ultimately we master the quantum gravity laws and comprehend fully the birth of our universe it may largely be by standing on the shoulders of Hawking.""Kip Thorne is an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. One of Hawking's most important contributions to science was his discovery of 'Hawking Radiation', composed of particles emitted from black holes. It was once thought that NOTHING could escape from a black hole, but this isn't the case. The idea goes as follows: Quantum mechanics implies that space is filled with particles and anti-particles - which are constantly appearing in pairs, separating, them coming together again and annihilating each other. In the presence of a black hole one member of the pair may fall into the black hole, leaving the other member without a partner to engage in mutual annihilation. This particle (or anti-particle) may escape as 'radiation' from the black hole. Sketches depicting Hawking RadiationScientists speculate that, unless a black hole gains mass (by engulfing other objects), it will eventually vanish.*****In this book Hawking answers questions he's been asked over the years. I'll give a brief synopsis of his responses, and leave you to read the book if you want more information.- Is there a God?No. Everything can be explained by the laws of nature. Matter and energy and space were spontaneously created by the Big Bang. - What came before the Big Bang?This is a meaningless question because there was no 'before' the Big Bang. Time (actually spacetime) was created BY the Big Bang. It's like asking 'what is south of the South Pole?'Spacetime (which is warped by the presence of solid matter) was formed by the Big Bang There's no 'south' of the South Pole- Is there other intelligent life in the universe?We don't know (yet) but Hawking likes to think there are other forms of intelligent life out there. They just haven't contacted Earth....perhaps because they're too far away. In any case, meeting an advanced civilization would be unadvisable (for us). Remember European settlers and American Indians? If aliens came here it would be like the film 'Independence Day.' - Can we predict the future?No. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates that we can't know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same instant. Thus we can't predict what will happen to a particle (or things made of particles) at a future time. Hawking observes: “No matter how powerful a computer you have, if you put lousy data in you will get lousy predictions out.” - What is inside a black hole? A black hole - which is single point of infinite density - is a star that's exhausted its nuclear fuel and collapsed.....but no one REALLY knows what's inside.- Is time travel possible?Theoretically yes. If spacetime was warped enough to form a loop, time travel would be possible. However, it time travel WAS possible, someone from the future would probably have come back to visit us already. In 2009, Hawking held a party for time travelers in his college at Cambridge, for a film about time travel. No one came.😊- Will we survive on Earth?Not forever. Nuclear war is a dire threat and there will be a meteorite strike at some point. Moreover, global warming is likely to make Earth uninhabitable, since our climate could become like that of Venus - boiling hot and raining sulfuric acid."" Hawking notes: ""One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will, therefore, survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a race.""- Should we colonize space?Yes. In order to survive long term, humans need to colonize other planets. This won't be cheap. Hawking helped initiate a research and engineering project called 'Breakthrough Starshot"", which strives to develop spacecraft capable of reaching the star system Alpha Centauri - which is 4.37 light-years (about 26 trillion miles) away. Hawking believes that in the next hundred years humans will be able to travel to the inner planets of the solar system and in 500 years we will have visited the nearest stars.Breakthrough Starshot- What are the prospects that scientists will unite Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum theory to achieve a complete theory of the laws of the universe?This will happen within the next millennium. - Will human genetic engineering occur?Yes. If scientists learn how to do something, SOMEONE will do it.....even if it's illegal. - Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?Yes. Computers are likely to overtake human intelligence in the next 100 years. Thus we need to ensure that computers have goals in line with ours. Just to be safe, robotic designs should always incorporate a 'kill switch.'- What world changing idea would you like to see implemented by humanity? The development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy. It would be an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming. *****Despite everything, Hawking was an optimistic soul. He advocates that we should: “Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done."" I found the book interesting and informative and would recommend it to people interested in Hawking's view of the 'big questions.'You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
95,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"Well, this was certainly a bitter-sweet read, knowing it is the last book of Steven Hawking. I wish I'd borrowed the e-book instead of the print because there are so many things I'd have loved to highlight. In Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Stephen Hawking attempts to answer 10 big questions, such as: •How did the universe begin?•Is there a god?•What is inside a black hole?•Is it possible to time travel?•Will AI outsmart us and if so, should we be worried?These and other questions are answered with brief, simple explanations. Steven Hawking's brilliance shines through on every page. His wittiness is prevalent throughout the book as well (including some wonderful jabs at Donnie-johnnie Trump. Suffice it to say, Mr. Hawking was not a fan!).I absolutely loved this book. I only wish it could have been longer. Steven Hawking was such a gift to humanity, his genius will live on for as long as there is intelligent life to appreciate his many contributions. I am so sad to have finished this book, but so glad to have read it.

Would you hope anyone would turn up?Hawking’s answer: In 2009 I held a party for time travelers in my college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge, for a film about time travel. To ensure that only genuine time travelers came, I didn’t send out the invitation until after the party. On the day of the party, I sat in college, hoping but no one came. I was disappointed, but not surprised, because I had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is positive, time travel is not possible. I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong.”In “Brief Answers to the Big Questions – The Final Book” by Stephen Hawking.I'm not really asking a question - a lot of what Hawking talks about really isn't even theoretically testable. Theoretical physics does tend in that direction - often it talks about ideas that are not testable yet, and may not be for a long time, or which are mathematical speculation as much as observation."

99,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Part of the legacy of an exceptional genius, a source of inspiration and a science communicator.Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Hawking understood how to use his life in many ways in exemplary fashion, despite his adverse health, and to research with full vigor. He was an inspiration to millions of people despite all the restrictions. And he used the nimbus as a genius, who is caged in his body, to achieve that goal. The press loved Hawking and he played with the media channels like a virtuoso. He was for understandable and entertaining science journalism away from the academic ivory tower. Far away from academics who fail because of their inability to explain their theses understandably and rousingly. And feast themselves on their lonely genius instead. Hawking wanted to make science accessible to the masses of people, fueling joy and enthusiasm, inspiring a new generation of researchers. Like other visionaries like Neil de Grasse Tyson, Carl Sagan and many others. The generation of bloggers known in the new media, Youtubers, etc. is inspired by him too.His unusual life enabled him to gain a reputation he probably would never have attained to that extent. And he was an inspiring model to all procrastinating, passive, blaming, quarreling, ... people in the affluent societies. How ridiculous is it when healthy people wallow in their self-pity or are unable to control their emotions. A quick look at the philanthropy and kindness of an exceptional explorer like Hawking would suffice. To shamefully take consequences and prioritize self-discipline, in order not to stagnate further.Concerning the ideological aspects of Hawking's work, every reader has to find his own approach. Depending on one´s preferred beliefs, agnosticism, atheism, nihilism, pastafarianism, ... his interpretations have a different status. Hawking's metaphysical hypotheses permeate his work and are relevant to readers who are not only interested in pure science. As well as his political analyzes and warnings.In addition to inspirational quotes, Hawking also left warnings of various, future dangers. Both should be used in the sense of a productive use of his legacy. The wisdom of his mantras and the pessimism of his warnings of AI and alien intelligences.The safety of AI depends on two factors: human competence and computer security. That sounds very frightening, but it should work in practice because a lot of infrastructures depends on it. Although similar thoughts revolved around the safety of nuclear weapons: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...But as long as capable programmers implement sufficient security mechanisms to never provide the AI with too much power and access rights, this danger is eliminated. And if these KIs are sufficiently protected against infiltration and sabotage, its fatal manipulation and misappropriation can be prevented. The only problem is that autonomous physical and purely virtual weapons systems need a lot of self-sufficiency and networking to work ""well."" Like all logistical, economic and process engineering applications. This will be a balancing act. Hopefully, nobody will stumble over the Terminator.The extraterrestrial intelligences are a different caliber and no approach is consistent. One can optimistically run to ruin or pessimistically pursue isolationism. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages. In Hawking's opinion, we would do well to behave as inconspicuously as possible and quietly evolve as quickly as possible. And in as little space as possible with fewer signals, emissions and detectable activities on just a few planets. This would entail restrictions on the use of new communications capabilities that are yet to be developed, space colonization, asteroid mining, and so on — all key technologies for the further development of humanity. For economic reasons, one will take all risks and expand as far as technically possible forever until it becomes clear which assumption was correct. There is a contradiction between Hawking's urge for space colonization with self-sufficient settlements with independent populations and his warning to be unobtrusive. Both are not possible at the same time. Humanity will gamble and hopefully win. The dangers of improving humans through genetic engineering and implants are small footnotes in relation to machine apocalypse or alien invasion. China has most likely already begun and everyone else will follow. As always, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Lapidar and soberly said, there were always hierarchies and society pyramids. It would be hypocritical now to pretend that immediate improvement and gene optimization would make a difference and break the taboo. Much ideology plays into it. The poverty that arises from the lack of distributive justice is the problem. And not whether the one human is breathing with gills underwater and lives 1000 years or forever and the other with fewer enhancements can only live 500 years and can afford a little less intelligence increase. There is no difference to today. For Hawking, the easily preventable diseases of civilization are incomprehensible. That so many people fail to get up regularly from sitting, eat less and move their lazy posteriors. Instead of just eating from 7 to 22 and not moving at all. Because it really is not rocket technology to get some ambitions not to die earlier because of stupid and preventable reasons. The criticized hostility to science will become another embarrassing footnote in history. One just has to sit out the time and mindfully avoid dealing with such channels. Prefer to actively participate in the dissemination of knowledge and the passing of the torch to the youth. Because with personified stupidity, ignorance, counseling resistance and lack of learning ability cannot be discussed. Therefore, it would be lost love and waste of time even to seek dialogue with such individuals engaging in those political agendas. Neither of both sides would benefit from it. It´s just a great pity that problems such as declining biodiversity, environmental degradation, global warming,… can only be resolved by a common consensus.Especially now that research is opening up more doors than ever before, a healthy mix of caution and curiosity is required. One never knows what one awakens. Be it in machines, unstoppable processes or in the vastness of space.Ein Teil des Vermächtnisses eines Jahrhundertgenies, einer Inspirationsquelle und Wissenschaftskommunikators.Hawking verstand es, sein Leben trotz widrigen Gesundheitszustandes in vielfacher Weise vorbildhaft zu nutzen und voller Elan zu forschen. Er war trotz aller Einschränkungen eine Inspiration für Millionen Menschen. Und er nutzte den Nimbus als in seinem Körper eingesperrtes Genie geschickt, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Die Presse liebte Hawking und er spielte auf ihre wie ein Virtuose.Er war für einen verständlichen und unterhaltsamen Wissenschaftsjournalismus abseits vom akademischen Elfenbeinturm. Weit weg von Akademikern, die an der Unfähigkeit scheitern, ihre Thesen verständlich und mitreißend erklären zu können. Und sich stattdessen an ihrem einsamen Genie ergötzen. Hawking wollte Wissenschaft für die breite Masse der Menschen zugänglich machen, Freude und Begeisterung schüren und damit eine neue Generation von Forschern inspirieren. Wie andere Visionäre wie Neil de GrasseTyson, Carl Sagan und viele andere. Auch die Generation der in den neuen Medien bekannten Blogger, Youtuber, etc. ist von ihm inspiriert. Sein ungewöhnliches Leben ermöglichte es ihm, eine Bekanntheit zu erlangen, die er so wahrscheinlich nie in diesem Ausmaß erlangt hätte. Und er war für alle prokrastinierenden, passiven, anderen die Schuld zuschiebenden, hadernden,…Menschen in den Wohlstandsgesellschaften ein Mahnmal. Denn wie lächerlich ist es, wenn gesunde Menschen sich in ihrem eigenen Selbstmitleid suhlen oder unfähig sind, ihre Emotionen zu kontrollieren. Dabei würde ein kurzer Blick auf die Philantrophie und Güte eines Ausnahmeforschers wie Hawking genügen. Um peinlich berührt Konsequenz und Selbstdisziplin zu forcieren, um nicht weiter zu stagnieren.Hinsichtlich der ideologischen Aspekte in Hawkings Werk muss jeder Leser seine eigene Herangehensweise finden. Je nach präferierten Glauben, Agnostizismus, Atheismus, Nihilismus, Pastafarismus,… haben sie einen anderen Stellenwert. Hawkings metaphysische Hypothesen durchziehen sein Werk und sind für Leser relevant, die nicht nur an der reinen Naturwissenschaft interessiert sind. Gleich wie auch seine politischen Analysen und Warnungen. Neben inspirierenden Zitaten hinterließ Hawking auch Warnungen vor diversen, zukünftigen Gefahren. Im Sinne einer fruchtbaren Nutzung seines Vermächtnisses sollte beides genutzt werden. Die Weisheit seiner Mantras und der Pessimismus seiner Warnungen vor KIs und außerirdischen Intelligenzen.Die Sicherheit von KIs hängt an 2 Faktoren: menschlicher Kompetenz und Computersicherheit. Das klingt sehr erschreckend, dürfte in der Praxis aber funktionieren, weil viel Infrastruktur daran hängt. Obwohl man das bei Kernwaffen auch dachte: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...Aber solange fähige Programmierer ausreichende Sicherheitsmechanismen einbauen, um die KI nie mit zu viel Machtfülle und Zugriffsrechten auszustatten, ist diese Gefahr ausgeräumt. Und wenn diese KIs ausreichend vor Infiltration und Sabotage geschützt sind, lässt sich ihre fatale Manipulation und Zwecksentfremdung verhindern. Das Problem ist nur, dass autonome physische und rein virtuelle Waffensysteme viel Autarkie und Vernetzung benötigen, um ""gut"" funktionieren zu können. Wie auch alle logistischen, wirtschaftlichen und prozesstechnischen Anwendungen. Das wird ein Balanceakt werden, bei dem hoffentlich niemand über den Terminator stolpert. Die außerirdischen Intelligenzen sind ein anderes Kaliber und kein Lösungsansatz ist konsistent. Grundsätzlich kann man optimistisch ins Verderben rennen oder pessimistisch Isolationismus betreiben. Jede Option hat für sich Vorteile und Nachteile. Nach Hawkings Meinung täten wir gut daran, uns möglichst unauffällig zu verhalten und still und heimlich möglichst schnell weiter zu evolvieren. Und das auf so wenig Raum wie möglich mit so wenig Signalen, Emissionen und detektierbaren Aktivitäten wie möglich. Das würde Einschränkungen bei dem Einsatz neuer, noch zu entwickelnder Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten, Weltraumkolonisation, Asteroidenbergbau, usw. mit sich bringen. Alles Schlüsseltechnologien für die weitere Entwicklung der Menschheit. Man wird aus ökonomischen Gründen alle Risiken eingehen und so weit wie technisch möglich expandieren. Bis sich zeigt, welche Annahme richtig war. Es besteht ein Widerspruch zwischen Hawkings drängen auf eine Weltraumkolonisation mit autarken Siedlungen mit ausreichender Population und seiner Warnung. Die Gefahren der Verbesserung des Menschen mittels Gentechnik und Implantaten sind in Relation zu Maschinenapokalypse oder einer Alieninvasion kleine Fußnoten. China hat sehr wahrscheinlich längst damit begonnen und alle anderen werden folgen. Wie immer, ""It´s the economy, stupid."" Lapidar und nüchtern gesagt gab es immer Hierarchien und Gesellschaftspyramiden. Es wäre jetzt scheinheilig, so zu tun als würde unmittelbare Verbesserung und Optimierung einen Unterschied machen und einen ach so großen Tabubruch darstellen. Viel Ideologie spielt da mit hinein. Die Armut, die aus der mangelnden Verteilungsgerechtigkeit erwächst, ist das Problem. Und nicht, ob der eine Mensch mit Kiemen unter Wasser atmen und 1000 Jahre alt werden und der andere ""nur"" halb so alt wird und sich etwas weniger Intelligenzsteigerung leisten kann.Nicht nachvollziehbar sind für Hawking die so leicht zu verhindernden Zivilisationskrankheiten. Dass so viele Menschen es nicht schaffen, regelmäßig vom Sitzen aufzustehen, weniger zu essen und sich zu bewegen. Anstatt nur zu essen und sich gar nicht zu bewegen. Denn es ist wirklich keine Raketentechnik. Die von ihm kritisierte Wissenschaftsfeindlichkeit wird eine weitere peinliche Fußnote in der Geschichte werden. Man muss die Zeit nur aussitzen und achtsam den Umgang mit derartigen Kanälen meiden. Lieber aktiv an der Verbreitung von Wissen und dem Reichen der Fackel an die Jugend partizipieren. Denn mit Dummheit, Ignoranz, Beratungsresistenz und mangelnder Lernfähigkeit lässt sich nicht diskutieren. Deswegen wäre es verlorene Liebemühe und Zeitverschwendung, mit solchen Individuen und politischen Strömungen überhaupt einen Dialog zu suchen. Keine der Parteien hätte davon irgendeinen Nutzen. Blöd nur, dass Probleme wie zurück gehende Biodiversität, Umweltzerstörung und Klimaerwärmung nur auf Basis eines gemeinsamen Konsens gelöst werden können.Gerade jetzt, wo die Forschung so viele Türen aufstößt wie noch nie, ist eine gesunde Mischung aus Vorsicht und Neugierde angesagt. Man weiß nie, was man weckt. Sei es in Maschinen, nicht mehr aufzuhaltenden Prozessen oder in den Weiten des Alls."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

★ This is the book that I decided to start my year with and I am glad that I did so. I have been meaning to read more non-fiction and more science books and I believe that this was a very good choice! It was my first exposure to Hawking as an author and I certainly want to read his other book (which I already own) later this year.★ As the name implies, the book asks ten grand questions and then try to answer them briefly and simply and if you are curious to what these questions are then here is a small list of them:1. Is there a God?2. How did it all begin?3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe?4. Can we predict the future?5. What is inside a black hole?6. Is time travel possible?7. Will we survive on Earth?8. Should we colonize space?9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?10. How do we shape the future?★ I think there are 2 things regarding those questions and answers that I should mention and that you should know if you ever decided that you want to read the book: The first thing is that the author does not hold back and he tries to explain everything and he sometimes opposes the religion so you have to read this with an open-mind. The second thing is that the language was scientific but it was as simple as it could be. I have to be honest and admit that I did not understand 100% of what was written as I am also not a physicists but a physician! I think that it is okay though because it was written by one of the world’s smartest authors (quite literally) and I am not one of the world’s smartest readers!★ I found this book to be real eye-opening and it made me ask questions, it has been 2 weeks since I finished it but I am still thinking about it! The way the questions were tackled was very logical and you could tell Hawking knows how we think! I was amazed by how humble and funny he was as a human being (Even when he addressed his personal life and health issues) and the journey through this book was really inspiring! I may not agree with all his ideas but I sure respect him as a human and as a man of science!

“While there’s life, there is hope.”

★ Summary: If you are looking for a great science non-fiction book then do no more because Stephen Hawking got you covered with his last book! The book answers ten questions although sometimes it spins in circle before doing so. The writing was easier than expected and the book was a pleasant surprise! I have already recommended it to a couple of friends and I know it will be the catalyst to a few heated-debates with said friends! R.I.P. Stephen Hawking!You can get more books from Book Depository"
101,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"This is my first book of 2019. As a thought-provoking book from one of the leading thinkers till recent times, a good way to start the year. I have previously read his “A brief history of time” and “The grand design” both of which I liked for presenting serious science in a very readable form. This book released after Stephen Hawking’s death does not disappoint, and is a great compilation of the most important topics Hawking dealt with in his lifetime – and these topics are also those most of us are extremely curious about. There are a couple of good forewords from Eddie Redmayne who played him in the movie “The theory of everything” and scientist Kip Thorne, who writes of his inspiration from Stephen Hawking’s life on his work on gravitational waves. The afterword by his daughter Lucy is touching including mentioning the impact he had on people as could be seen by the large crowds which quietly lined the street on his passing. The first topic in the is – “Is there a God?”. Hawking’s views on this are already public, and also included in the movie based on his life. The point he makes is that religion describes God as some kind of a superhuman whom we can discuss/debate with and be judged by (some traditions such as Advaita Vedanta do not do that though). He goes on to discuss how time itself started with the big bang and the universe, and well-defined laws of nature mean there is nothing for a God to do. You may agree, partly agree or disagree with his views, but he certainly offers a lot of food for thought. The next topic is on how it all started with the big bang. While all the answers are yet not there, Hawking is confident that physics will crack the puzzle of how the universe sprang from nothing. There is already a lot of progress made such as with M-theory. The section on black holes is probably the most detailed and it is also a bit dense in parts. This is probably the area Stephen Hawking has contributed the most, and I suppose that explains the level of detail. The discussion is fascinating – do black holes retain context and information of what goes in? How do they come about, and how can study them?In the discussions around climate change, and in fleeting references in other sections as well, Hawking stresses that we are being very irresponsible with respect to Planet Earth, and people in power had better pay attention to this. The other sections on space travel, AI make for interesting reading as well.This book is certainly a tribute to Stephen Hawking’s curiosity, passion for science and intellectual genius. A great book to start the year – very intellectually stimulating.My rating: 4.5 / 5."
102,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59094974-ladan,4,"Brilliant, wise, fun, and simple! yet a bit repetitive.---------------------------------------Just imagine Hawking was your teacher at school, were you going to pick the same major? were you doing the same job you have now? were you looking at the universe the same way you have been looking so far? I have a pile of friends who have grown a hatred for science merely because of the fact that their teachers couldn't simply explain and illuminate the stuff that Hawking has covered in his books. In this book, he answers 10 questions and some of them have been brought up in his other books, yet this book is the extract of his work and could be recommended to anyone who wants to start reading Hawking. I have summarized the first two questions in the following pic, which were the most important ones to me. The rest of the questions somehow depend on humans and their behaviour, which I personally am so pessimist about.I would love to be as hopeful as Hawking, but let's get real, take a look around, no promising sign! Look at the role models of younger generations, look at the number of followers on Kim Kardashian's Instagram page... I mean seriously 150 million people?? man this fucked up world is doomed! Even Hawking's dead :( matching soundtrack:day one/Hans ZimmerP.s: I almost got 10 years older due to reuploading the pic, I can't help it, if you want a high-quality one just let me know"
103,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,4,"""Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""I loved loved loved this book. I have always been fascinated by science and astronomy and I have never read anything by Stephen Hawking, and this book was absolutely fascinating and thought provoking to me. I loved hearing his theories about our future and I agree with a lot about what he has to say about religion and how human fascination with science and space travel is so important for our future. I really agree with that statement about having all our eggs in one basket and how it's important for us to find a new home.Here is an amazing quote where Stephen Hawking explains better than I could ever attempt to why I'm not a religious person: “Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion. Religion was an early attempt to answer the questions we all ask: why are we here, where did we come from? Long ago, the answer was almost always the same: gods made everything. The world was a scary place, so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning, storms or eclipses. Nowadays, science provides better and more consistent answers, but people will always cling to religion, because it gives comfort, and they do not trust or understand science.” I loved this book. I will admit some if it went way over my head with the mathematics and equations and quantum physics but I did my best and I feel like I learned a lot while reading this. RIP Stephen Hawking."
104,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Having always had much admiration for the way Stephen Hawking has lived his life, overcoming adversity to become one of the brightest stars in our sky (pun absolutely intended), I was intrigued to see what his last contribution would bring with it. One of the things I most appreciate about him and his books is that he makes often complex and complicated topics accessible to everyday individuals such as myself - those without a background or degree in the sciences, and here he explores some of the biggest and most important unanswered questions (hence the title) in a way that is understandable to all and doesn't require expert or previous knowledge on said topics.I am sad that no more of his fantastic works can now be published, and I have huge respect for him as although he certainly had some challenging obstacles to overcome he has contributed so much to what we now know which is more than most of us will achieve in this life - the word inspirational is what immediately comes to mind. A thoroughly engaging, intriguing and enjoyable romp through Hawking's opinion on age-old, philosophical questions right through to some of those at the forefront of current affairs. Rest in peace, Professor Hawking!"
105,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,5,One of the best pop-science books I've ever read. Wonderful afterword by his daughter. Black holes are cool as shit.
106,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58356782-bryan,5,"A total page-turner, this book is quite remarkable it gives you a sense of a personal interview between Dr. Hawking and the reader. The Big questions are:Is there a God?How did it all begin?Is time travel possible?What is inside of a black hole?Is there other intelligent life in the universe?Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?How do we shape the future?Should we colonize space?Can we predict the future?Will we survive on earth? I highly recommend this book."
107,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Even though the book was meant to be as exoteric as possible, it is still rather thorough for the general public. To me, the answers were prolix and discursive. Much explaining was done, but I often found myself asking ""How's that relevant to the question?""."
108,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96756984-yesenia-juarez,5,"I have always heard of Stephen Hawking growing up but I have never read into him. This man is all the hype! Wow, this book gave me chills every 30 mins. I’m convinced my IQ is 3 in comparison to his 160. Amazing!!!!"
109,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,5,"Just as I finished reading Brief Answers to the Big Questions this morning, the power came on again. It had been off since 08:00 to about 12:00, and also from 09:00 to 00:00 last night, in what our South African electricity utility Eskom terms ‘load shedding’ (Stage 2). Due to unplanned breakdowns in its generating capacity, the utility effectively institutes rolling blackouts across the country to reduce peak demand, and to ultimately avoid a total system collapse, following which it will take weeks to restore the national grid.Local municipalities do institute a load-shedding schedule so that we as residents can prepare, but these are invariably outdated or inaccurate. In addition, the electricity supply situation is so volatile it can change faster than you can say ‘lightbulb’ (one night in December we hit a new record of Stage 6 load-shedding, with all the schedules now updated to accommodate up to an ominous-sounding Stage 8.)What does this have to do with Stephen Hawking’s book? In Part 10, ‘How Do We Shape The Future?’, Hawking’s response to what his ‘world-changing idea’ would be is quite simple, and drolly amusing in our own context: “… the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy …”In South Africa, The Powers That Be have deemed that coal-fired power stations are still the way to go, with the State-owned electricity actively legislating against independent power producers and renewable energy due to a perceived threat of competition, and our plentiful supply of cheap coal (a classic monopoly situation, though this is changing as the wheels now start to come off.)What is holding us back in South Africa at this precise point in time? Politics; and self-serving politicians. With the ruling party’s grip on complete power being slowly eroded, and every day bringing more damning news of State capture of the essential organs of government, patronage, and systemic corruption, there is such a bun fight at the moment that everything else that really matters – such as functioning infrastructure and economic growth – go out the window as political fat cats jockey and squabble for their privileged position at the public trough.Ideally, what our electricity utility should do is bring in external experts to conduct a thorough audit of its generating capacity, what the precise technical and coal-supply issues are, and then to devise a proper timetable that can be adhered to, budgeted and costed for, and then also give us a much-needed light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.But as Hawking himself warns in this brilliant book, there is an alarming revolt against expertise in general and science in particular engulfing the world as nationalism and prejudice increase inexorably: “With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.”Hawking calls for a renewed faith in science, as it were, in order to harness the power of technology to solve our current problems, which are alarming in their severity and potential to become exponentially worse. The main issues here, of course, are climate change, the burgeoning global population, and how to ensure dignity and a reasonable quality of life for all.I loved this incredible book, which I think is such a fitting tribute to the legacy of Stephen Hawking, both as a scientist, a teacher and influencer, a father, and a husband. Perhaps Hawking’s daunting physical struggle against his MLS is what influenced his ferocious tenacity in ferreting out scientific questions and implications that continue to have a profound impact on Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in the form of M-theory.From the provocative opening chapter entitled ‘Is There a God?’, the book provides a readily understandable (and equation-free) introduction to Hawking’s major scientific contributions. What I enjoyed the most though were the wide-ranging chapters towards the end, such as ‘Will We Survive on Earth?’ to ‘Should We Colonise Space?’ and ‘Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?’, to the thought-provoking and deeply personal final chapter, ‘How Do We Shape the Future?’In her Afterword, daughter Lucy Hawking reveals that her father knew about, and approved, of this book, which is effectively culled from a lifetime of writing and thinking. Even though it is heavily edited and condensed, the man’s impish humour, compassion, and innate grasp of the essence of any problem, so matter how large or small, is evident on every page.I was also fascinated to learn how Hawking’s legacy is continuing, in the form of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, and the Future of Life Institute. What delighted me equally is Hawking’s abiding love for science fiction. He comments intelligently and fondly on everything from Star Trek to Back to the Future and Interstellar. This is truly a book to cherish."
110,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"Extremely readable—on par with Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.Would revisit this one in the future as it's so short and interesting—very light on the physics.My favorite topic would have to be time travel, which Hawking believes is theoretically possible, but unlikely.This book was published 7 months after Hawking's death and was finished by his scientific colleagues, friends, and family using his writings, lectures, and notes. Included is a foreword from Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne, who played Hawking in the movie The Theory of Everything; an introduction by Nobel Prize-winning physicist and Hawking's lifelong friend, Kip Thorne; and a touching afterword from Hawking's daughter, Lucy.“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”"
111,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,3,"Dare I say this book felt like an unnecessary addition to Hawking's work this soon after his death? I get it, when someone with the stature of Hawking passes away, the demand for a book is there. And since I believe Hawking to be an extraordinary person, what objection could there be for this release? My main gripe is the editing. It's beyond my grasp how such a wide-spread book could be edited so poorly, making it feel rushed and cheap. There are a lot of sentences and entire paragraphs being repeated in different chapters. None of which feel right, they could've easily be skipped over or paraphrased in different ways. Other than that, this book gives people who were already familiar with Hawking's beliefs nothing new. Yet the book is very much about those beliefs. I would've understood the appeal of a more personal memoir as a quick posthumous work, but I'm not quite clear what the target audience is in this case.Despite all that, it's Hawking, it's inspiring, it's at times thought provoking. I think the final chapters concerning A.I., space colonisation and the problems humanity faces in this and coming centuries are where this work shines."
112,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"As the final parting gift from one of the modern legends of scientific genius and embodiment of human perseverance, I couldn't give this anything less than 5-stars. 

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

Poignantly bookended by a beautifully written Foreword from Eddie Redmayne and a touching Afterword from his daughter, Lucy Hawking, this book is a collection of essays which attempt to answer some of the biggest questions rooted in science, and to an extent philosophy, posed to humankind. From the existence of God and other intelligent life in the universe, to time and space travel, and whether we will survive on Earth, or will artificial intelligence outsmart humans - Hawking's addressed these issues in his usual authentic, direct and honest manner. While there are some hard science smattered throughout the narrative, especially when the topic centred around cosmology, a substantial chunk of the writing can be easily comprehended without requiring a physics degree. I believe this is a book which should be read by everyone as it tackles some really pressing issues about the future of humanity. 

We spend a great deal of time studying history, which, let's face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it's a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence. We are aware of the potential dangers, but perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialisation.

113,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75837977-sasha,5,One of the easiest 5 stars rate I had to give! I mean I loved it.While reading the book I was fascinated and intimated. Reading a tiny piece of his mind is and will always be fascinating! It was such an easy book to read. No need to be a science nerd like in The Big bang Theory to enjoy that book. He is easy to understand and should we talk about his sense of humour? I don't think so but I laughed so much!he was such an inspiration and will keep being an inspirational man...
114,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10499865-jack-chaucer,5,"A concise series of bold and sound conclusions from one of the most brave, expansive and beautiful minds this planet has ever produced. This guy traveled the universe for most of his life, despite being paralyzed in a wheelchair for much of it. He let nothing hold him back right through to his death in 2018. Check all religions and afterlife wishful thinking at the door with this book because they make no sense to Hawking based on the latest scientific discoveries.

115,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42124025-netta,5,"Mind-boggling and utterly moving book which is legitimately bigger-than-life as it contains black holes, space-time, time travels, dreamers, discoveries, wonders and, of course,  Star Trek. One may think that this book is indeed what it looks like – a genius addressing big and teeny tiny little bit naïve questions that you and me are longing to ask, such as How Did It All Begin? Is There Other Intelligent Life In The Universe? Can We Predict Future? What Is Inside a Black Hole? Is Time Travel Possible? Will We Survive on Earth? and naturally following Should We Colonise Space? In reality, this book is bigger on the inside. It teaches us (again) to ask bold, big questions – something which seemed perfectly fine for us when we were children and makes us look like dilettantes uttering nonsense now. It kindly reminds us of our endless possibilities no matter how restricted by circumstances we feel. It shows us the infinite beauty of things which are much bigger than our understanding and much older that anything we can possibly imagine for comparison. It tells us stories of stars that died unbelievably long ago and stars that are living so far we most likely will never see them. It proves us why being ”scientifically literate” is important for our future and for the future of our children. And, first and foremost, it tells the story of a boy who passionately, without cease, asked questions and refused to believe in boundaries. Instead, he believed in endless possibilities if not of a single human being, then of the curious, smart and brave generations to come."
116,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413571-william-lawrence,5,"This book is bursting with wisdom from one of the most intelligent minds to ever exist on this planet. I took this one out from a library, but I liked it so much I bought a copy and intend to reread it in the near future. There are passages of beauty and awe throughout his scientific explanations. In addition to explaining the origins of the universe, Hawking described his own origins: ""I wanted to be a great scientist. However, I wasn't a very good student when I was at school, and was rarely more than halfway up my class... but I had good friends at school. And we talked about everything and, specifically, the origin of the universe. this is where my dream began..."" (p. 20).In answering the questions of our origins, Hawking argued:""I have no desire to offend anyone of faith, but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator.."" (p. 34). Hawking continued to explain his thoughts on the question of a afterlife: ""I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think when we die we return to dust. But there's a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life..."" (p. 38).Hawking warns of the dangers of nuclear weapons and climate change. Although he does not endorse genetic engineering of humans, he does warn that it is inevitable.In relation to our future as a species and the connection to technology Hawking writes: ""I believe the future of communication is brain-computer interfaces."" (p. 194). He expands: ""Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it."" (p. 196).There in his final paragraph, Hawking leaves us this memorable advice: ""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet."" (p. 211)."

Shape the future.""This is how Stephen Hawking lived his life and this is the message to the world he presents in Brief Answers To The Big Questions.Hawking was a genius. His research and ideas have forever changed how we see and know the universe around us. His theories on Black Holes have changed Cosmology as much, or more, that the ground breaking works by Galileo and Einstein. His ideas and theories will effect his field forever but it is his personality and drive that we should also not forget. Despite being told in his early twenties that he wouldn't live more than another five years, due to Motor Neuron Disease, Hawking set forth and continued towards his educational, career, family and personal goals and lived another fifty years, succeeding even beyond his own wildest dreams.In this book, Hawking gives us his thoughts and ideas on ten ""big questions"" including; god, other intelligent life in the universe, time travel, the need to colonize space, and artificial intelligence. He writes in a manner that presents the science in a way that is both easy to understand and that shares his personal thoughts and feelings.Hawking pointed out that science is currently out of favor with the general public and that this will prove to be a large problem for both individuals and society as a whole. He presents some ideas on how to get people more excited about both science and how it will effect the world. I think reading this book would be a good start."
118,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"This book has been compiled by daughter Lucy Hawking and contains an anthology of the most important popularizing work of her father Stephen. Although it was published after his death, Hawking was involved in the editing process at the end of his life, but he didn't really finish it. Of course I recognized many pieces from ""A Brief History of Time"", the book for which Hawking is best known to the general public and which I read a few weeks ago. In that sense it did not offer me much new, except for the pieces that dealt with climate change and artificial intelligence.What is striking once again is the remarkable social involvement of Hawking (cf. the aforementioned themes), his humour and his openly professed optimism, which was based on a strong belief in science (he uses the word ‘belief’ explicitly). Just like in ""A Brief History"", his ability to clearly explain extremely difficult matters (on black holes for instance) is striking. The only regrettable, but at the same time unavoidable thing is that it is noticeable that this book consists of cutting and pasting from different sources. (2.5 stars)"
119,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam-cooks-the-books--,4,I'm sure the remarkable Stephen Hawking was always being asked hard questions; I'm grateful for the opportunity to read some of his final thoughts on these topics:~Is there a God?~How did it all begin?~Is there other intelligent life in the universe?~Can we predict the future?~What is inside a black hole?~Is time travel possible?~Will we survive on Earth?~Should we colonize space?~Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?~How do we shape the future?I won't claim to have completely understood his answers but what he has written is definitely food for thought.
120,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25493797-khurram,5,"A great book, by a great man. I had heard the name Steven Hawking, but never read any of his theories. Simply for the very reason the something coming from the smartest men of the previous 2 generations would be overly complicated and beyond my understanding. What I discovered in this book is Steven Hawking was just a great man as we was a scientist, but an incredible teacher as well. His method of writing allows people like, who have a passing interest in but only a vacation of his ability in science to understand his work. This skill cannot be understated as if the most knowledgeable person in the world cannot comuninate their knowledge it is list with them. Sort of like sending it into a black hole. The book is easily readable, Hawking' s dry wit and sense of humour makes reading and learning from it a pleasure. The metaphors on this book allowed me to grasp the basics of even the most complicated theories easily. Though I differ from him from a belief perspective, I do respect his ideas and I think like any great teacher Hawking would have welcomed this difference of opinion as a show of curiosity towards finding the truth.I am sure his views, and more in-depth theories will go a long way towards solving many of the great world wide problems highlighted in this book that we face today.I would recommend this book to any. It is a great read, and I don't thing anyone can read this book without learning something from it or seeing something a different way. Also it give a great insight into Steven Hawking as a person for people who know him best or colleagues of his, but from his own writing style. He has a great sense of humour, and amazing determination. This is a great final word and goodbye to a man who's theories will inspire many and live on far into the future. One day some of these theories might even become scientific laws one day."

Is time travel possible?Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?It was great - recommend the audiobook too!
122,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21575078-florencia,4,"A few years ago, The Times newspaper ran a headline on the front page which said 'Hawking: God Did Not Create Universe'. The article was illustrated. God was shown in a drawing by Michelangelo, looking thunderous. They printed a photo of me, looking smug. They made it look like a duel between us. But I don't have a grudge against God. I do not want to give the impression that my work is about proving or disproving the existence of God. My work is about finding a rational framework to understand the universe around us.Catechist, atheist, agnostic; I've been there. So naturally, my main interest in this book is that haunting question regarding the existence of a god, the creation of things. I had faith, I don't know where it went; perhaps a part of it went with the books I've read that made it impossible for me to absorb some notions without questioning them. I told a priest once and he looked at me as if I were selling drugs and tickets to strip clubs at school, not without expressing how presumptuous human beings are for wanting to know everything. A similar reaction is mentioned in this book.Needless remarks aside, a feeble faith tinged with fear - whereas it represents some obvious disadvantages - keeps the mind open. What do you have? The laws of nature or a self-existent and eternal being that created time and space. The complete absence of destiny or someone to blame for lousy decisions. The serenity of dust or the afterlife - on whichever side you get, because you believe or you don't. There is no wager here. There's a chance that an omniscient designer is going to notice that you're believing ""just in case"". I prefer the afterlife Hawking describes: 
wishful thinking.
 This scientist, key factor in singularities and father of Hawking Radiation, is also the master of analogies. The content of this book is a pedagogic challenge and yet, he makes it approachable. Some ideas and quotes appear more than once throughout the book (those already familiar with Hawking's work may be less enthusiastic about this) but I didn't mind; more resources for me to retain rather complex processes, while there's still light. Some of the Big Questions and one-sentence quotes:Is there a God?If you accept, as I do, that the laws of nature are fixed, then it doesn't take long to ask: what role is there for God?How did it all begin?We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe.Is there other intelligent life in the universe?I shall take this [intelligent life] to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid survival of the species.What is inside a black hole?Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science-fiction writers, but they are firmly matters of science fact.Is time travel possible?
There was a young lady of Wight Who travelled much faster than lightShe departed one day In a relative way And arrived on the previous night.
How do we shape the future?If you know how something works, you can control it.The book includes comments of those who knew Hawking: 
teacher, mentor and friend.

“While there’s life, there is hope.” 

Stephen Hawking was such an inspirational man. When he first received his diagnosis, he was ready to give up on life; he was ready to abandon his studies as his body slowly diminished, but with the help of a few friends and loved ones he managed to carry on and complete his work. And, to his surprise, he carried on living beyond what he thought was capable. So, he made the most of every moment as he pursued his academic goals. 

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

He truly was a great man. And the best thing about this book is its simplicity. Stephen Hawking is not dealing with simple things here; he is dealing with complexities that he has spent his life researching and pondering over. Yet, for all that, he makes it approachable and readable to the everyday reader. He knows his audience, and he writes for them, which is fantastic because with a book like this one could easily have become alienated. He was the leading expert in his field of theoretical physics, but he knew exactly how to communicate his ideas to the public.And that is so important. He considers huge questions in this book. Questions about time travel and alternate universes, but he discusses them in a friendly way. Anybody could read this without getting lost. I really do recommend this one. It’s a book that will make you think, and it’s a book that will make you appreciate one of the greatest scientists of his generation."
124,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Stephen HawkingStephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist who's considered one of the most brilliant scientists since Albert Einstein. In addition to making huge contributions to physics, Hawking strove to share his discoveries with the general public, and his book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a best seller. Moreover, Hawking did most of his research while battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which makes his accomplishments even more remarkable. In 'Brief Answers to Big Questions', completed after Hawking's death (from his speeches, interviews, essays, notes and lectures), the gifted scientist responds to a number of queries that are relevant to our time. However it's Hawking's QUESTIONS about relativity and quantum mechanics that will resonate going forward. In the introduction to this book, American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne writes: ""Newton gave us answers, Hawking gave us questions. And Hawking's questions themselves keep on giving, generating breakthroughs decades later. When ultimately we master the quantum gravity laws and comprehend fully the birth of our universe it may largely be by standing on the shoulders of Hawking.""Kip Thorne is an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. One of Hawking's most important contributions to science was his discovery of 'Hawking Radiation', composed of particles emitted from black holes. It was once thought that NOTHING could escape from a black hole, but this isn't the case. The idea goes as follows: Quantum mechanics implies that space is filled with particles and anti-particles - which are constantly appearing in pairs, separating, them coming together again and annihilating each other. In the presence of a black hole one member of the pair may fall into the black hole, leaving the other member without a partner to engage in mutual annihilation. This particle (or anti-particle) may escape as 'radiation' from the black hole. Sketches depicting Hawking RadiationScientists speculate that, unless a black hole gains mass (by engulfing other objects), it will eventually vanish.*****In this book Hawking answers questions he's been asked over the years. I'll give a brief synopsis of his responses, and leave you to read the book if you want more information.- Is there a God?No. Everything can be explained by the laws of nature. Matter and energy and space were spontaneously created by the Big Bang. - What came before the Big Bang?This is a meaningless question because there was no 'before' the Big Bang. Time (actually spacetime) was created BY the Big Bang. It's like asking 'what is south of the South Pole?'Spacetime (which is warped by the presence of solid matter) was formed by the Big Bang There's no 'south' of the South Pole- Is there other intelligent life in the universe?We don't know (yet) but Hawking likes to think there are other forms of intelligent life out there. They just haven't contacted Earth....perhaps because they're too far away. In any case, meeting an advanced civilization would be unadvisable (for us). Remember European settlers and American Indians? If aliens came here it would be like the film 'Independence Day.' - Can we predict the future?No. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates that we can't know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same instant. Thus we can't predict what will happen to a particle (or things made of particles) at a future time. Hawking observes: “No matter how powerful a computer you have, if you put lousy data in you will get lousy predictions out.” - What is inside a black hole? A black hole - which is single point of infinite density - is a star that's exhausted its nuclear fuel and collapsed.....but no one REALLY knows what's inside.- Is time travel possible?Theoretically yes. If spacetime was warped enough to form a loop, time travel would be possible. However, it time travel WAS possible, someone from the future would probably have come back to visit us already. In 2009, Hawking held a party for time travelers in his college at Cambridge, for a film about time travel. No one came.😊- Will we survive on Earth?Not forever. Nuclear war is a dire threat and there will be a meteorite strike at some point. Moreover, global warming is likely to make Earth uninhabitable, since our climate could become like that of Venus - boiling hot and raining sulfuric acid."" Hawking notes: ""One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will, therefore, survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a race.""- Should we colonize space?Yes. In order to survive long term, humans need to colonize other planets. This won't be cheap. Hawking helped initiate a research and engineering project called 'Breakthrough Starshot"", which strives to develop spacecraft capable of reaching the star system Alpha Centauri - which is 4.37 light-years (about 26 trillion miles) away. Hawking believes that in the next hundred years humans will be able to travel to the inner planets of the solar system and in 500 years we will have visited the nearest stars.Breakthrough Starshot- What are the prospects that scientists will unite Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum theory to achieve a complete theory of the laws of the universe?This will happen within the next millennium. - Will human genetic engineering occur?Yes. If scientists learn how to do something, SOMEONE will do it.....even if it's illegal. - Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?Yes. Computers are likely to overtake human intelligence in the next 100 years. Thus we need to ensure that computers have goals in line with ours. Just to be safe, robotic designs should always incorporate a 'kill switch.'- What world changing idea would you like to see implemented by humanity? The development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy. It would be an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming. *****Despite everything, Hawking was an optimistic soul. He advocates that we should: “Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done."" I found the book interesting and informative and would recommend it to people interested in Hawking's view of the 'big questions.'You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
125,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"Well, this was certainly a bitter-sweet read, knowing it is the last book of Steven Hawking. I wish I'd borrowed the e-book instead of the print because there are so many things I'd have loved to highlight. In Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Stephen Hawking attempts to answer 10 big questions, such as: •How did the universe begin?•Is there a god?•What is inside a black hole?•Is it possible to time travel?•Will AI outsmart us and if so, should we be worried?These and other questions are answered with brief, simple explanations. Steven Hawking's brilliance shines through on every page. His wittiness is prevalent throughout the book as well (including some wonderful jabs at Donnie-johnnie Trump. Suffice it to say, Mr. Hawking was not a fan!).I absolutely loved this book. I only wish it could have been longer. Steven Hawking was such a gift to humanity, his genius will live on for as long as there is intelligent life to appreciate his many contributions. I am so sad to have finished this book, but so glad to have read it.
""This is not the end of the story, but just the beginning of what I hope will be billions of years of life flourishing in the cosmos.”
"
126,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25398561-andr-oliveira,5,"In this book Stephen Hawking, possibly the last book written by him, answers some big questions and makes some predictions for the future taking into account the current state of science. How did it all begin? Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Is time travel possible? Obviously, I wasn't expecting solutions for these questions, but Stephen Hawking is able to explain complicated questions in a way that everyone would understand. Also, I love how Stephen Hawking answers those questions without disregarding other's beliefs.

""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

Would you hope anyone would turn up?Hawking’s answer: In 2009 I held a party for time travelers in my college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge, for a film about time travel. To ensure that only genuine time travelers came, I didn’t send out the invitation until after the party. On the day of the party, I sat in college, hoping but no one came. I was disappointed, but not surprised, because I had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is positive, time travel is not possible. I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong.”In “Brief Answers to the Big Questions – The Final Book” by Stephen Hawking.I'm not really asking a question - a lot of what Hawking talks about really isn't even theoretically testable. Theoretical physics does tend in that direction - often it talks about ideas that are not testable yet, and may not be for a long time, or which are mathematical speculation as much as observation."
128,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10039791-giorgio,3,"Why 3 stars if the book is well-written?Well, there is NOTHING NEW.He just said again and again what he always said...Maybe it should be sold as ""Hawking in 90 minutes"" or ""Hawking for Dummies""...Yes, his life was really RICH in experiencies, and pain, and fight to overcome an ammount of things that almost nobody could... but...At the end, I did not feel any ""answer"", just plain stabilishment cientific thinking.Not enough for me."
129,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Part of the legacy of an exceptional genius, a source of inspiration and a science communicator.Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Hawking understood how to use his life in many ways in exemplary fashion, despite his adverse health, and to research with full vigor. He was an inspiration to millions of people despite all the restrictions. And he used the nimbus as a genius, who is caged in his body, to achieve that goal. The press loved Hawking and he played with the media channels like a virtuoso. He was for understandable and entertaining science journalism away from the academic ivory tower. Far away from academics who fail because of their inability to explain their theses understandably and rousingly. And feast themselves on their lonely genius instead. Hawking wanted to make science accessible to the masses of people, fueling joy and enthusiasm, inspiring a new generation of researchers. Like other visionaries like Neil de Grasse Tyson, Carl Sagan and many others. The generation of bloggers known in the new media, Youtubers, etc. is inspired by him too.His unusual life enabled him to gain a reputation he probably would never have attained to that extent. And he was an inspiring model to all procrastinating, passive, blaming, quarreling, ... people in the affluent societies. How ridiculous is it when healthy people wallow in their self-pity or are unable to control their emotions. A quick look at the philanthropy and kindness of an exceptional explorer like Hawking would suffice. To shamefully take consequences and prioritize self-discipline, in order not to stagnate further.Concerning the ideological aspects of Hawking's work, every reader has to find his own approach. Depending on one´s preferred beliefs, agnosticism, atheism, nihilism, pastafarianism, ... his interpretations have a different status. Hawking's metaphysical hypotheses permeate his work and are relevant to readers who are not only interested in pure science. As well as his political analyzes and warnings.In addition to inspirational quotes, Hawking also left warnings of various, future dangers. Both should be used in the sense of a productive use of his legacy. The wisdom of his mantras and the pessimism of his warnings of AI and alien intelligences.The safety of AI depends on two factors: human competence and computer security. That sounds very frightening, but it should work in practice because a lot of infrastructures depends on it. Although similar thoughts revolved around the safety of nuclear weapons: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...But as long as capable programmers implement sufficient security mechanisms to never provide the AI with too much power and access rights, this danger is eliminated. And if these KIs are sufficiently protected against infiltration and sabotage, its fatal manipulation and misappropriation can be prevented. The only problem is that autonomous physical and purely virtual weapons systems need a lot of self-sufficiency and networking to work ""well."" Like all logistical, economic and process engineering applications. This will be a balancing act. Hopefully, nobody will stumble over the Terminator.The extraterrestrial intelligences are a different caliber and no approach is consistent. One can optimistically run to ruin or pessimistically pursue isolationism. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages. In Hawking's opinion, we would do well to behave as inconspicuously as possible and quietly evolve as quickly as possible. And in as little space as possible with fewer signals, emissions and detectable activities on just a few planets. This would entail restrictions on the use of new communications capabilities that are yet to be developed, space colonization, asteroid mining, and so on — all key technologies for the further development of humanity. For economic reasons, one will take all risks and expand as far as technically possible forever until it becomes clear which assumption was correct. There is a contradiction between Hawking's urge for space colonization with self-sufficient settlements with independent populations and his warning to be unobtrusive. Both are not possible at the same time. Humanity will gamble and hopefully win. The dangers of improving humans through genetic engineering and implants are small footnotes in relation to machine apocalypse or alien invasion. China has most likely already begun and everyone else will follow. As always, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Lapidar and soberly said, there were always hierarchies and society pyramids. It would be hypocritical now to pretend that immediate improvement and gene optimization would make a difference and break the taboo. Much ideology plays into it. The poverty that arises from the lack of distributive justice is the problem. And not whether the one human is breathing with gills underwater and lives 1000 years or forever and the other with fewer enhancements can only live 500 years and can afford a little less intelligence increase. There is no difference to today. For Hawking, the easily preventable diseases of civilization are incomprehensible. That so many people fail to get up regularly from sitting, eat less and move their lazy posteriors. Instead of just eating from 7 to 22 and not moving at all. Because it really is not rocket technology to get some ambitions not to die earlier because of stupid and preventable reasons. The criticized hostility to science will become another embarrassing footnote in history. One just has to sit out the time and mindfully avoid dealing with such channels. Prefer to actively participate in the dissemination of knowledge and the passing of the torch to the youth. Because with personified stupidity, ignorance, counseling resistance and lack of learning ability cannot be discussed. Therefore, it would be lost love and waste of time even to seek dialogue with such individuals engaging in those political agendas. Neither of both sides would benefit from it. It´s just a great pity that problems such as declining biodiversity, environmental degradation, global warming,… can only be resolved by a common consensus.Especially now that research is opening up more doors than ever before, a healthy mix of caution and curiosity is required. One never knows what one awakens. Be it in machines, unstoppable processes or in the vastness of space.Ein Teil des Vermächtnisses eines Jahrhundertgenies, einer Inspirationsquelle und Wissenschaftskommunikators.Hawking verstand es, sein Leben trotz widrigen Gesundheitszustandes in vielfacher Weise vorbildhaft zu nutzen und voller Elan zu forschen. Er war trotz aller Einschränkungen eine Inspiration für Millionen Menschen. Und er nutzte den Nimbus als in seinem Körper eingesperrtes Genie geschickt, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Die Presse liebte Hawking und er spielte auf ihre wie ein Virtuose.Er war für einen verständlichen und unterhaltsamen Wissenschaftsjournalismus abseits vom akademischen Elfenbeinturm. Weit weg von Akademikern, die an der Unfähigkeit scheitern, ihre Thesen verständlich und mitreißend erklären zu können. Und sich stattdessen an ihrem einsamen Genie ergötzen. Hawking wollte Wissenschaft für die breite Masse der Menschen zugänglich machen, Freude und Begeisterung schüren und damit eine neue Generation von Forschern inspirieren. Wie andere Visionäre wie Neil de GrasseTyson, Carl Sagan und viele andere. Auch die Generation der in den neuen Medien bekannten Blogger, Youtuber, etc. ist von ihm inspiriert. Sein ungewöhnliches Leben ermöglichte es ihm, eine Bekanntheit zu erlangen, die er so wahrscheinlich nie in diesem Ausmaß erlangt hätte. Und er war für alle prokrastinierenden, passiven, anderen die Schuld zuschiebenden, hadernden,…Menschen in den Wohlstandsgesellschaften ein Mahnmal. Denn wie lächerlich ist es, wenn gesunde Menschen sich in ihrem eigenen Selbstmitleid suhlen oder unfähig sind, ihre Emotionen zu kontrollieren. Dabei würde ein kurzer Blick auf die Philantrophie und Güte eines Ausnahmeforschers wie Hawking genügen. Um peinlich berührt Konsequenz und Selbstdisziplin zu forcieren, um nicht weiter zu stagnieren.Hinsichtlich der ideologischen Aspekte in Hawkings Werk muss jeder Leser seine eigene Herangehensweise finden. Je nach präferierten Glauben, Agnostizismus, Atheismus, Nihilismus, Pastafarismus,… haben sie einen anderen Stellenwert. Hawkings metaphysische Hypothesen durchziehen sein Werk und sind für Leser relevant, die nicht nur an der reinen Naturwissenschaft interessiert sind. Gleich wie auch seine politischen Analysen und Warnungen. Neben inspirierenden Zitaten hinterließ Hawking auch Warnungen vor diversen, zukünftigen Gefahren. Im Sinne einer fruchtbaren Nutzung seines Vermächtnisses sollte beides genutzt werden. Die Weisheit seiner Mantras und der Pessimismus seiner Warnungen vor KIs und außerirdischen Intelligenzen.Die Sicherheit von KIs hängt an 2 Faktoren: menschlicher Kompetenz und Computersicherheit. Das klingt sehr erschreckend, dürfte in der Praxis aber funktionieren, weil viel Infrastruktur daran hängt. Obwohl man das bei Kernwaffen auch dachte: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...Aber solange fähige Programmierer ausreichende Sicherheitsmechanismen einbauen, um die KI nie mit zu viel Machtfülle und Zugriffsrechten auszustatten, ist diese Gefahr ausgeräumt. Und wenn diese KIs ausreichend vor Infiltration und Sabotage geschützt sind, lässt sich ihre fatale Manipulation und Zwecksentfremdung verhindern. Das Problem ist nur, dass autonome physische und rein virtuelle Waffensysteme viel Autarkie und Vernetzung benötigen, um ""gut"" funktionieren zu können. Wie auch alle logistischen, wirtschaftlichen und prozesstechnischen Anwendungen. Das wird ein Balanceakt werden, bei dem hoffentlich niemand über den Terminator stolpert. Die außerirdischen Intelligenzen sind ein anderes Kaliber und kein Lösungsansatz ist konsistent. Grundsätzlich kann man optimistisch ins Verderben rennen oder pessimistisch Isolationismus betreiben. Jede Option hat für sich Vorteile und Nachteile. Nach Hawkings Meinung täten wir gut daran, uns möglichst unauffällig zu verhalten und still und heimlich möglichst schnell weiter zu evolvieren. Und das auf so wenig Raum wie möglich mit so wenig Signalen, Emissionen und detektierbaren Aktivitäten wie möglich. Das würde Einschränkungen bei dem Einsatz neuer, noch zu entwickelnder Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten, Weltraumkolonisation, Asteroidenbergbau, usw. mit sich bringen. Alles Schlüsseltechnologien für die weitere Entwicklung der Menschheit. Man wird aus ökonomischen Gründen alle Risiken eingehen und so weit wie technisch möglich expandieren. Bis sich zeigt, welche Annahme richtig war. Es besteht ein Widerspruch zwischen Hawkings drängen auf eine Weltraumkolonisation mit autarken Siedlungen mit ausreichender Population und seiner Warnung. Die Gefahren der Verbesserung des Menschen mittels Gentechnik und Implantaten sind in Relation zu Maschinenapokalypse oder einer Alieninvasion kleine Fußnoten. China hat sehr wahrscheinlich längst damit begonnen und alle anderen werden folgen. Wie immer, ""It´s the economy, stupid."" Lapidar und nüchtern gesagt gab es immer Hierarchien und Gesellschaftspyramiden. Es wäre jetzt scheinheilig, so zu tun als würde unmittelbare Verbesserung und Optimierung einen Unterschied machen und einen ach so großen Tabubruch darstellen. Viel Ideologie spielt da mit hinein. Die Armut, die aus der mangelnden Verteilungsgerechtigkeit erwächst, ist das Problem. Und nicht, ob der eine Mensch mit Kiemen unter Wasser atmen und 1000 Jahre alt werden und der andere ""nur"" halb so alt wird und sich etwas weniger Intelligenzsteigerung leisten kann.Nicht nachvollziehbar sind für Hawking die so leicht zu verhindernden Zivilisationskrankheiten. Dass so viele Menschen es nicht schaffen, regelmäßig vom Sitzen aufzustehen, weniger zu essen und sich zu bewegen. Anstatt nur zu essen und sich gar nicht zu bewegen. Denn es ist wirklich keine Raketentechnik. Die von ihm kritisierte Wissenschaftsfeindlichkeit wird eine weitere peinliche Fußnote in der Geschichte werden. Man muss die Zeit nur aussitzen und achtsam den Umgang mit derartigen Kanälen meiden. Lieber aktiv an der Verbreitung von Wissen und dem Reichen der Fackel an die Jugend partizipieren. Denn mit Dummheit, Ignoranz, Beratungsresistenz und mangelnder Lernfähigkeit lässt sich nicht diskutieren. Deswegen wäre es verlorene Liebemühe und Zeitverschwendung, mit solchen Individuen und politischen Strömungen überhaupt einen Dialog zu suchen. Keine der Parteien hätte davon irgendeinen Nutzen. Blöd nur, dass Probleme wie zurück gehende Biodiversität, Umweltzerstörung und Klimaerwärmung nur auf Basis eines gemeinsamen Konsens gelöst werden können.Gerade jetzt, wo die Forschung so viele Türen aufstößt wie noch nie, ist eine gesunde Mischung aus Vorsicht und Neugierde angesagt. Man weiß nie, was man weckt. Sei es in Maschinen, nicht mehr aufzuhaltenden Prozessen oder in den Weiten des Alls."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

★ This is the book that I decided to start my year with and I am glad that I did so. I have been meaning to read more non-fiction and more science books and I believe that this was a very good choice! It was my first exposure to Hawking as an author and I certainly want to read his other book (which I already own) later this year.★ As the name implies, the book asks ten grand questions and then try to answer them briefly and simply and if you are curious to what these questions are then here is a small list of them:1. Is there a God?2. How did it all begin?3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe?4. Can we predict the future?5. What is inside a black hole?6. Is time travel possible?7. Will we survive on Earth?8. Should we colonize space?9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?10. How do we shape the future?★ I think there are 2 things regarding those questions and answers that I should mention and that you should know if you ever decided that you want to read the book: The first thing is that the author does not hold back and he tries to explain everything and he sometimes opposes the religion so you have to read this with an open-mind. The second thing is that the language was scientific but it was as simple as it could be. I have to be honest and admit that I did not understand 100% of what was written as I am also not a physicists but a physician! I think that it is okay though because it was written by one of the world’s smartest authors (quite literally) and I am not one of the world’s smartest readers!★ I found this book to be real eye-opening and it made me ask questions, it has been 2 weeks since I finished it but I am still thinking about it! The way the questions were tackled was very logical and you could tell Hawking knows how we think! I was amazed by how humble and funny he was as a human being (Even when he addressed his personal life and health issues) and the journey through this book was really inspiring! I may not agree with all his ideas but I sure respect him as a human and as a man of science!

“While there’s life, there is hope.”

★ Summary: If you are looking for a great science non-fiction book then do no more because Stephen Hawking got you covered with his last book! The book answers ten questions although sometimes it spins in circle before doing so. The writing was easier than expected and the book was a pleasant surprise! I have already recommended it to a couple of friends and I know it will be the catalyst to a few heated-debates with said friends! R.I.P. Stephen Hawking!You can get more books from Book Depository"
131,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"This is my first book of 2019. As a thought-provoking book from one of the leading thinkers till recent times, a good way to start the year. I have previously read his “A brief history of time” and “The grand design” both of which I liked for presenting serious science in a very readable form. This book released after Stephen Hawking’s death does not disappoint, and is a great compilation of the most important topics Hawking dealt with in his lifetime – and these topics are also those most of us are extremely curious about. There are a couple of good forewords from Eddie Redmayne who played him in the movie “The theory of everything” and scientist Kip Thorne, who writes of his inspiration from Stephen Hawking’s life on his work on gravitational waves. The afterword by his daughter Lucy is touching including mentioning the impact he had on people as could be seen by the large crowds which quietly lined the street on his passing. The first topic in the is – “Is there a God?”. Hawking’s views on this are already public, and also included in the movie based on his life. The point he makes is that religion describes God as some kind of a superhuman whom we can discuss/debate with and be judged by (some traditions such as Advaita Vedanta do not do that though). He goes on to discuss how time itself started with the big bang and the universe, and well-defined laws of nature mean there is nothing for a God to do. You may agree, partly agree or disagree with his views, but he certainly offers a lot of food for thought. The next topic is on how it all started with the big bang. While all the answers are yet not there, Hawking is confident that physics will crack the puzzle of how the universe sprang from nothing. There is already a lot of progress made such as with M-theory. The section on black holes is probably the most detailed and it is also a bit dense in parts. This is probably the area Stephen Hawking has contributed the most, and I suppose that explains the level of detail. The discussion is fascinating – do black holes retain context and information of what goes in? How do they come about, and how can study them?In the discussions around climate change, and in fleeting references in other sections as well, Hawking stresses that we are being very irresponsible with respect to Planet Earth, and people in power had better pay attention to this. The other sections on space travel, AI make for interesting reading as well.This book is certainly a tribute to Stephen Hawking’s curiosity, passion for science and intellectual genius. A great book to start the year – very intellectually stimulating.My rating: 4.5 / 5."
132,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59094974-ladan,4,"Brilliant, wise, fun, and simple! yet a bit repetitive.---------------------------------------Just imagine Hawking was your teacher at school, were you going to pick the same major? were you doing the same job you have now? were you looking at the universe the same way you have been looking so far? I have a pile of friends who have grown a hatred for science merely because of the fact that their teachers couldn't simply explain and illuminate the stuff that Hawking has covered in his books. In this book, he answers 10 questions and some of them have been brought up in his other books, yet this book is the extract of his work and could be recommended to anyone who wants to start reading Hawking. I have summarized the first two questions in the following pic, which were the most important ones to me. The rest of the questions somehow depend on humans and their behaviour, which I personally am so pessimist about.I would love to be as hopeful as Hawking, but let's get real, take a look around, no promising sign! Look at the role models of younger generations, look at the number of followers on Kim Kardashian's Instagram page... I mean seriously 150 million people?? man this fucked up world is doomed! Even Hawking's dead :( matching soundtrack:day one/Hans ZimmerP.s: I almost got 10 years older due to reuploading the pic, I can't help it, if you want a high-quality one just let me know"
133,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,4,"""Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""I loved loved loved this book. I have always been fascinated by science and astronomy and I have never read anything by Stephen Hawking, and this book was absolutely fascinating and thought provoking to me. I loved hearing his theories about our future and I agree with a lot about what he has to say about religion and how human fascination with science and space travel is so important for our future. I really agree with that statement about having all our eggs in one basket and how it's important for us to find a new home.Here is an amazing quote where Stephen Hawking explains better than I could ever attempt to why I'm not a religious person: “Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion. Religion was an early attempt to answer the questions we all ask: why are we here, where did we come from? Long ago, the answer was almost always the same: gods made everything. The world was a scary place, so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning, storms or eclipses. Nowadays, science provides better and more consistent answers, but people will always cling to religion, because it gives comfort, and they do not trust or understand science.” I loved this book. I will admit some if it went way over my head with the mathematics and equations and quantum physics but I did my best and I feel like I learned a lot while reading this. RIP Stephen Hawking."

One of the things I most appreciate about him and his books is that he makes often complex and complicated topics accessible to everyday individuals such as myself - those without a background or degree in the sciences, and here he explores some of the biggest and most important unanswered questions (hence the title) in a way that is understandable to all and doesn't require expert or previous knowledge on said topics.I am sad that no more of his fantastic works can now be published, and I have huge respect for him as although he certainly had some challenging obstacles to overcome he has contributed so much to what we now know which is more than most of us will achieve in this life - the word inspirational is what immediately comes to mind. A thoroughly engaging, intriguing and enjoyable romp through Hawking's opinion on age-old, philosophical questions right through to some of those at the forefront of current affairs. Rest in peace, Professor Hawking!"

The Big questions are:Is there a God?How did it all begin?Is time travel possible?What is inside of a black hole?Is there other intelligent life in the universe?Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?How do we shape the future?Should we colonize space?Can we predict the future?Will we survive on earth? I highly recommend this book."
137,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78956353-jako,1,"Even though the book was meant to be as exoteric as possible, it is still rather thorough for the general public. To me, the answers were prolix and discursive. Much explaining was done, but I often found myself asking ""How's that relevant to the question?""."
138,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96756984-yesenia-juarez,5,"I have always heard of Stephen Hawking growing up but I have never read into him. This man is all the hype! Wow, this book gave me chills every 30 mins. I’m convinced my IQ is 3 in comparison to his 160. Amazing!!!!"
139,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,5,"Just as I finished reading Brief Answers to the Big Questions this morning, the power came on again. It had been off since 08:00 to about 12:00, and also from 09:00 to 00:00 last night, in what our South African electricity utility Eskom terms ‘load shedding’ (Stage 2). Due to unplanned breakdowns in its generating capacity, the utility effectively institutes rolling blackouts across the country to reduce peak demand, and to ultimately avoid a total system collapse, following which it will take weeks to restore the national grid.Local municipalities do institute a load-shedding schedule so that we as residents can prepare, but these are invariably outdated or inaccurate. In addition, the electricity supply situation is so volatile it can change faster than you can say ‘lightbulb’ (one night in December we hit a new record of Stage 6 load-shedding, with all the schedules now updated to accommodate up to an ominous-sounding Stage 8.)What does this have to do with Stephen Hawking’s book? In Part 10, ‘How Do We Shape The Future?’, Hawking’s response to what his ‘world-changing idea’ would be is quite simple, and drolly amusing in our own context: “… the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy …”In South Africa, The Powers That Be have deemed that coal-fired power stations are still the way to go, with the State-owned electricity actively legislating against independent power producers and renewable energy due to a perceived threat of competition, and our plentiful supply of cheap coal (a classic monopoly situation, though this is changing as the wheels now start to come off.)What is holding us back in South Africa at this precise point in time? Politics; and self-serving politicians. With the ruling party’s grip on complete power being slowly eroded, and every day bringing more damning news of State capture of the essential organs of government, patronage, and systemic corruption, there is such a bun fight at the moment that everything else that really matters – such as functioning infrastructure and economic growth – go out the window as political fat cats jockey and squabble for their privileged position at the public trough.Ideally, what our electricity utility should do is bring in external experts to conduct a thorough audit of its generating capacity, what the precise technical and coal-supply issues are, and then to devise a proper timetable that can be adhered to, budgeted and costed for, and then also give us a much-needed light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.But as Hawking himself warns in this brilliant book, there is an alarming revolt against expertise in general and science in particular engulfing the world as nationalism and prejudice increase inexorably: “With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.”Hawking calls for a renewed faith in science, as it were, in order to harness the power of technology to solve our current problems, which are alarming in their severity and potential to become exponentially worse. The main issues here, of course, are climate change, the burgeoning global population, and how to ensure dignity and a reasonable quality of life for all.I loved this incredible book, which I think is such a fitting tribute to the legacy of Stephen Hawking, both as a scientist, a teacher and influencer, a father, and a husband. Perhaps Hawking’s daunting physical struggle against his MLS is what influenced his ferocious tenacity in ferreting out scientific questions and implications that continue to have a profound impact on Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in the form of M-theory.From the provocative opening chapter entitled ‘Is There a God?’, the book provides a readily understandable (and equation-free) introduction to Hawking’s major scientific contributions. What I enjoyed the most though were the wide-ranging chapters towards the end, such as ‘Will We Survive on Earth?’ to ‘Should We Colonise Space?’ and ‘Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?’, to the thought-provoking and deeply personal final chapter, ‘How Do We Shape the Future?’In her Afterword, daughter Lucy Hawking reveals that her father knew about, and approved, of this book, which is effectively culled from a lifetime of writing and thinking. Even though it is heavily edited and condensed, the man’s impish humour, compassion, and innate grasp of the essence of any problem, so matter how large or small, is evident on every page.I was also fascinated to learn how Hawking’s legacy is continuing, in the form of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, and the Future of Life Institute. What delighted me equally is Hawking’s abiding love for science fiction. He comments intelligently and fondly on everything from Star Trek to Back to the Future and Interstellar. This is truly a book to cherish."

Included is a foreword from Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne, who played Hawking in the movie The Theory of Everything; an introduction by Nobel Prize-winning physicist and Hawking's lifelong friend, Kip Thorne; and a touching afterword from Hawking's daughter, Lucy.“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.

141,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,3,"Dare I say this book felt like an unnecessary addition to Hawking's work this soon after his death? I get it, when someone with the stature of Hawking passes away, the demand for a book is there. And since I believe Hawking to be an extraordinary person, what objection could there be for this release? My main gripe is the editing. It's beyond my grasp how such a wide-spread book could be edited so poorly, making it feel rushed and cheap. There are a lot of sentences and entire paragraphs being repeated in different chapters. None of which feel right, they could've easily be skipped over or paraphrased in different ways. Other than that, this book gives people who were already familiar with Hawking's beliefs nothing new. Yet the book is very much about those beliefs. I would've understood the appeal of a more personal memoir as a quick posthumous work, but I'm not quite clear what the target audience is in this case.Despite all that, it's Hawking, it's inspiring, it's at times thought provoking. I think the final chapters concerning A.I., space colonisation and the problems humanity faces in this and coming centuries are where this work shines."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

Poignantly bookended by a beautifully written Foreword from Eddie Redmayne and a touching Afterword from his daughter, Lucy Hawking, this book is a collection of essays which attempt to answer some of the biggest questions rooted in science, and to an extent philosophy, posed to humankind. From the existence of God and other intelligent life in the universe, to time and space travel, and whether we will survive on Earth, or will artificial intelligence outsmart humans - Hawking's addressed these issues in his usual authentic, direct and honest manner. While there are some hard science smattered throughout the narrative, especially when the topic centred around cosmology, a substantial chunk of the writing can be easily comprehended without requiring a physics degree. I believe this is a book which should be read by everyone as it tackles some really pressing issues about the future of humanity. 

We spend a great deal of time studying history, which, let's face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it's a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence. We are aware of the potential dangers, but perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialisation.

Reading a tiny piece of his mind is and will always be fascinating! It was such an easy book to read. No need to be a science nerd like in The Big bang Theory to enjoy that book. He is easy to understand and should we talk about his sense of humour? I don't think so but I laughed so much!he was such an inspiration and will keep being an inspirational man...

One may think that this book is indeed what it looks like – a genius addressing big and teeny tiny little bit naïve questions that you and me are longing to ask, such as How Did It All Begin? Is There Other Intelligent Life In The Universe? Can We Predict Future? What Is Inside a Black Hole? Is Time Travel Possible? Will We Survive on Earth? and naturally following Should We Colonise Space? In reality, this book is bigger on the inside. It teaches us (again) to ask bold, big questions – something which seemed perfectly fine for us when we were children and makes us look like dilettantes uttering nonsense now. It kindly reminds us of our endless possibilities no matter how restricted by circumstances we feel. It shows us the infinite beauty of things which are much bigger than our understanding and much older that anything we can possibly imagine for comparison. It tells us stories of stars that died unbelievably long ago and stars that are living so far we most likely will never see them. It proves us why being ”scientifically literate” is important for our future and for the future of our children. And, first and foremost, it tells the story of a boy who passionately, without cease, asked questions and refused to believe in boundaries. Instead, he believed in endless possibilities if not of a single human being, then of the curious, smart and brave generations to come."

I took this one out from a library, but I liked it so much I bought a copy and intend to reread it in the near future. There are passages of beauty and awe throughout his scientific explanations. In addition to explaining the origins of the universe, Hawking described his own origins: ""I wanted to be a great scientist. However, I wasn't a very good student when I was at school, and was rarely more than halfway up my class... but I had good friends at school. And we talked about everything and, specifically, the origin of the universe. this is where my dream began..."" (p. 20).In answering the questions of our origins, Hawking argued:""I have no desire to offend anyone of faith, but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator.."" (p. 34). Hawking continued to explain his thoughts on the question of a afterlife: ""I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think when we die we return to dust. But there's a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life..."" (p. 38).Hawking warns of the dangers of nuclear weapons and climate change. Although he does not endorse genetic engineering of humans, he does warn that it is inevitable.In relation to our future as a species and the connection to technology Hawking writes: ""I believe the future of communication is brain-computer interfaces."" (p. 194). He expands: ""Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it."" (p. 196).There in his final paragraph, Hawking leaves us this memorable advice: ""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet."" (p. 211)."

Shape the future.""This is how Stephen Hawking lived his life and this is the message to the world he presents in Brief Answers To The Big Questions.Hawking was a genius. His research and ideas have forever changed how we see and know the universe around us. His theories on Black Holes have changed Cosmology as much, or more, that the ground breaking works by Galileo and Einstein. His ideas and theories will effect his field forever but it is his personality and drive that we should also not forget. Despite being told in his early twenties that he wouldn't live more than another five years, due to Motor Neuron Disease, Hawking set forth and continued towards his educational, career, family and personal goals and lived another fifty years, succeeding even beyond his own wildest dreams.In this book, Hawking gives us his thoughts and ideas on ten ""big questions"" including; god, other intelligent life in the universe, time travel, the need to colonize space, and artificial intelligence. He writes in a manner that presents the science in a way that is both easy to understand and that shares his personal thoughts and feelings.Hawking pointed out that science is currently out of favor with the general public and that this will prove to be a large problem for both individuals and society as a whole. He presents some ideas on how to get people more excited about both science and how it will effect the world. I think reading this book would be a good start."
148,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"This book has been compiled by daughter Lucy Hawking and contains an anthology of the most important popularizing work of her father Stephen. Although it was published after his death, Hawking was involved in the editing process at the end of his life, but he didn't really finish it. Of course I recognized many pieces from ""A Brief History of Time"", the book for which Hawking is best known to the general public and which I read a few weeks ago. In that sense it did not offer me much new, except for the pieces that dealt with climate change and artificial intelligence.What is striking once again is the remarkable social involvement of Hawking (cf. the aforementioned themes), his humour and his openly professed optimism, which was based on a strong belief in science (he uses the word ‘belief’ explicitly). Just like in ""A Brief History"", his ability to clearly explain extremely difficult matters (on black holes for instance) is striking. The only regrettable, but at the same time unavoidable thing is that it is noticeable that this book consists of cutting and pasting from different sources. (2.5 stars)"

150,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5112204-nuruddin-azri,4,"Hawking is one of the most influential scholars on physics and astronomy in 20th century. This book tackles the very fundamental questions of human being and nature although in this last book, he keeps asking the question of the existence of God (and denies it with a critical question on science and the origin of universe which he believes is the result of random collision).As an admirer of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin (Hawking also mentions Feynman, Heisenberg, Oppenheimer, Laplace, Hubble, Kant, Aristotle, Euclid, Hoyle and Dirac frequently), Hawking develops the theory pertaining black hole, space-time and quantum theory. Hawking saids, Einstein's Theory of Relativity concerns with the big things while the his Theory of Black Hole concerns with the micro things.Basically, there are three major themes when we come with the discourse of universe: matter, energy and space. According to Hawking, matter and energy is the same coin with a different facet. That is why the equation e=mc2 is so important. He also touches on the M-theory, how space and time are warped in the black hole and what is inside the black hole, all in an engaging way when he manages to blend the complex and intricate theory of physics with simple analogies and mentioning popular fictional science movies like Terminator, Star Trek, Jurassic Park and Interstellar.In the last chapter, Hawking answers the question of science and nature. Hawking is really positive with the future of science. He believes from now and in the future, more people need to study and travel to the other space and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute positively to the humankind with a cautious condition and wisdom in dealing with it.Like Einstein, Freud and other world-level scholars, Hawking coined back the importance of human to protect the nature because some of the big crises that make the nature imbalance in the modern world actually can be controlled by ourselves like deforestation, global warming, greenhouse effect, increase in human population, epidemic diseases, degradation of oceans, rapid extinction of other species and the need to develop renewable sources.With a very limited ability to move and write due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that he has, he should receive a world honour and praise with his excellent contribution to the understanding of the universe in general."

The thought that there is so much beyond us that we can barely begin to imagine it, makes me immensely fascinated. In addition to that, this school year I had an incredible Physiques teacher who made me completely fall in love with the subject. For those reasons, when I saw Brief Answers to the Big Questions on one of the bookshelves of my go-to bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it. I had tried reading another of Hawking's works, A Brief History of Time, but, unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it because I found it to be too complex for what I know about Physiques at the moment. However, that didn't deter me from picking up this book which I'm so glad I did.This book is Stephen Hawking's attempt to respond to some of the most common and intriguing questions people ask about space/the future.One of the many amazing aspects of this book is how Hawking takes the time to explain the numerous concepts as simple as possible in order for people who aren't familiarised with them to be able to understand. Unfortunately, there were still a few of them which I couldn't grasp which, despite might being my own fault, deterred me from giving this book 5 stars.Nevertheless, I loved learning about his perspective and opinion on the various matters touched upon this book and I definitely acquired some new knowledge through it.Moreover, the postscript written by his daughter Lucy was probably one of my favourite parts of the entire book. It made me cry and realise how much I looked up to this man as she spoke about him so fondly. He was truly a spectacular person and I'm truly grateful that I was alive at the same time as him, but deeply sorry he couldn't stay with us for longer.To sum up, I would highly recommend Brief Answers to the Big Questions if you're keen on reading about Hawking's views on some very important topics and learn more about the great universe we are a part of."

This man has inspired generations around the world to think about the big questions and to do so in a much more engaged and informed manner, how many can boast that?Following wonderful introductions from actor Eddie Redmayne and physicist Kip Thorne, we hear Hawking's views on everything from god and religion, artificial intelligence, interstellar travel, time travel, and the gravest issues facing humanity today.While you may not agree with some of his positions you will certainly enjoy the depth of thought he brings to every issue. When dealing with such a potent intellect, you of course realize that any work such as this is merely a précis to the voluminous contemplations that underly each of these positions. However, it has always been Hawking's unique skill to make the impenetrably difficult ideas accessible to the imaginations of everyone, he has maintained this ability now through his final work. "

By far one of the most brilliant minds to have graced this world, but also one of the most worthy people to have soared. He is on my list of people I wish I could have met, and I mourn his death. I liked the inclusion of interview clips where you could hear the ""voice"" he came to call his own. I also liked the fact that, even if he was explaining why another perspective didn't hold up, he never belittled--straightforward, respectful, and kind all the way.Some of you might know that, or possibly not, but I specialized in nonfiction for my creative writing degree and delved into science writing (which is widely varied by the way). I wish I had been able to read this book among my classmates because it truly is an interesting little work packed full of interesting and wholesome ideas.

When the title said ""Brief Answers"" I guess I confused that with understandable answers. I don't know if it is just me, but I would go into this book not expecting to understand a large portion of it, and being okay with that. At first I tried to really understand all of the info and I felt a little lost and in over my head a bit but then I found that if I just read over the technical stuff but didn't focus too much on what I couldn't understand, I still came away with the message at the end of each chapter.

Stephen clearly explains his answers in succinct detail to ""Is there a God?"" to start the book with an encore-level question. He then follows it up with ""How did it all begin?"" and fully explains how Quantum allows some Positive Energy (=mc^2 a.k.a. galaxies and planets) added to some Negative Energy (Space - vacuum energy of expansion) still adds up to zero. Stephen's ""defense"" and rational surely holds up under the highest academic scrutiny.He went a little deep into question 5 about black holes, but I'll certainly allow myself to read this chapter twice. Stephen lies buried between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin with the Entropy of a Black Hole equation engraved on his tombstone (S=Akc^3 / 4Gh-bar). One would never know that we knew so much about these Black Holes!Stephen has the occasional jabs he is known for, with a few aimed at squarely at Trump. In ""How do we shape the future?"", we read: ""Education and science and technology research are endangered now more than ever before. ... The exchange of people across borders enables skills to transfer more quickly and brings new people with different ideas, derived from their different backgrounds. ...With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.""He gives credit to his teachers: Often that spark comes from a teacher. Allow me to explain. I wasn't the easiest person to teach, I was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy. But when I was fourteen my teacher at my school in St Albans, Dikran Tahta, showed me how to harness my energy and encouraged me to think creatively about mathematics. He opened my eyes to maths ats the blue-print of the universe itself. If you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher. When each of us thinks about what we can do in life, chances are we can do it because of a teacher.""Stephen describes the necessity to colonize space. ""We can make interstellar travel a long-term aim - in the next 200 to 500 years."" He describes the current rocket speed limitations of today and how the NEAREST star system (Alpha Centauri) would take 70,000 years of travel at the speed of Voyager. (Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years distance) ""If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump."" Then Stephen describes a plan starting with nano-size spacecraft that could reach speeds of 0.2c and be there in 20 years.Tempered with this optimism, is his realism about the world today: Earth resources draining too quickly. Climate change. Reduction of the polar ice caps. Deforestation. Over-population. Disease. War. Famine. Lack of water. Decimation of animal species. Yet in classic Hawking fashion, finishes this list with: 
""These are all solvable but so far have not been solved.""
Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question.
""It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

4 stars. Such a delightful listen. It's educational and entertaining and full of wit. Hawking was a brilliant man and he had a great sense of humor and it shines here. In between the chapters are little interviews with Hawking and he was so quick witted in his responses and those sections were easily my favorite part of the book. There are a lot of really great quotes in this book. He had a very interesting outlook on life. I loved that this was primarily about Physics but also we get a bit of his personal life thrown in there as well. 
“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”
Out of all of the quotes I could post that one is my absolute favorite and really stood out to me the most. Overall, I can't say enough great things about this book and how much I enjoyed. If you are even just a little bit interested in science pick this book up. I highly recommend the audiobook. I look forward to reading and studying more of his work."

We are so easily distracted and stressed by the daily woes of economy, politics, religion, environment, but Hawking reminds us that in a few hundred years, super-humans will be zipping around the cosmos, settling on Mars etc. Life will be unimaginable to ours today!I loved listening to this on audio, each chapter has snippets of Hawking's own speaking, and there's also a lovely afterward by his daughter that is a fitting final tribute to a great man!"

As interesting as I find science to be my brain just doesn't seem to agree. And that severely impacts my enjoyment of such books. That's why I'm rating it somewhere in the middle. Although I feel bad about not giving it five stars.The afterword by Lucy Hawking was great. I was probably not the only person to get something in their eye while reading it.(And yes, you did contribute. More than you know.)"

When we have reached similar crises in our history, there has usually been somewhere else to colonise. Columbus did it in 1492 when he discovered the New World. But now there is no new world.

By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will therefore survive the disaster.

164,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41705015-mounaim-kamel,5,"One of my favorites of all time, this is the last masterpiece authored by Stephen Hawking (2018), in this book he discusses some of the main questions of humanity like: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, What is inside a Black hole?, Is time travel possible?, Should we Colonize Space?, Will AI outsmart us?...etcThe first two chapters were as if I am reading a cookbook. Hawking was like ..ok guys! today I am gonna show you how to make a universe, and all we need is these ingredients: matter, energy and space, and all these 3 ingredients were invented at the moment of the big bang, From nothing, how? The secret lies in (Physics) something we call “negative energy”“Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of course he’s not just making a hill—he’s also making a hole………When the Big Bang produced a massive amount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. the positive and the negative add up to zero, always………... this negative energy is in space. This may sound odd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion, space itself is a vast store of negative energy.”All we need now is something to start this whole process, because everything that exists must have a cause that brought it into existence, right? Right?? Well..Here is where it gets a bit tricky.“in our daily lives .... You can’t just click your fingers and summon up a cup of coffee... But travel down into this coffee cup—through the milk particles, down to …the sub-atomic level, and you enter a world where conjuring something out of nothing is possible…at this scale, particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics. And they really can appear at random”and since we know the universe itself was once very small according to the big bang theory, this means that the universe itself could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature. it came into being on a minuscule scale out of nothingness with no “cause” beyond the laws of quantum mechanics, which allow for randomness. And then from that moment on, vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expanded, a place to store all the negative energy needed to make a balance.As you see, one thing that Hawking does well, is writing about science for the general reader, you don’t need to be a genius to understand his books, while he throws some jokes here and there which makes you feel like you are in the middle of a normal conversation with him. the only thing I didn’t like about the book is that it comes to an end."
165,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"​It took a long time for me to get through this book, not because it was difficult (Hawking always makes the most complex processes in the universe relatively simple) and not because it was dry or boring (Hawking is a truly superior writer who manages to relate to his audience and share with them his sense of awe about his personal life and life of the universe that surrounds us. I could not get through this book because I love Stephen Hawking, more than I can say. I was obsessed with his area theorem (which is what initially drew me to his work) and then I loved him all the more each time I read something he wrote. It did not matter that I did not know him personally. His death made me feel as if I had lost a friend and a favorite teacher. I surprised myself by how many times I cried while reading this book. It was just too painful to keep listening to his words, which remained her with us, even though he was gone. It didn't help that Hawking wrote about death quite a bit throughout the book. All of his insights were invaluable, but it was so sad to read his thoughts on death so soon after his actual death. This book, like his others, was a must read if you are a fan of physics. This short, very readable book of essays and answers covers topics including:Should we travel to space and colonize space? Should we develop AI​What are black holes; how do they work; what do we know and not know about them? (This is, without question, my favorite part of the book. No one writes about black holes like Hawking does. What a gifted writer!!!!!)What is escape velocity?How are particles and antiparticles made? (He has explained this many times, but this really did seem like the simplest, most concise explanation i have read from him.)What was his long career like, especially since he had so many challenges?Do we live in a predictable universe? (Exceptionally wonderful history of Laplacian determinism, which was replaced by chaos and quantum physics. Very simple explanation of Max Plank's work on packets of radiation- glorious writing, very simplified for the non-physicist. )What is quantum physics? (Such short answers, and yet, he seems to cover more ground and provide more complete answers than many authors who write much longer books.)Simple but eloquent explanation of the uncertainty principle. (Take home point was how Max Plank and Heisenberg challenged the idea of a deterministic universe).Can we predict everything about our future? (In theory the laws of physics allow us to do so, but the equations are far too complex.)"

But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly cannot continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last 300 years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts, and in particular the aggressive impulses, that we had in caveman days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the greenhouse effect becoming unstable.”― Stephen HawkingThis was a difficult book for me to review. How does one assign a rating to a book written by a legend in the scientific community, other to consider the ""readability"" of the material from my perspective? Although I have taken quite a few science classes, my areas of knowledge do not reside in the subjects of Theoretical Physics or Cosmology (meaning I'd be fine with reading something like Quantum Physics for Colossal Dummies). Hawking did a fine job of trying to make the subjects understandable to the lay person but the chapters devoted to black holes and time travel were still too scientifically intellectual for me. Perhaps I am a person who needs graphics and illustrations for certain subjects, as I lack the appropriate imagination.Even though I did not completely understand or enjoy all the subjects presented in the book, I admired Hawking's sense of humor, enthusiasm and optimism. He still managed to get in a few digs about the historical lack of intelligent behavior by the human race, which I couldn't disagree with. "

I stand with Hawking in that it is our responsibility to  all  become scientifically literate. Hawking walks us through how things came to be discovered, how they work, what we should look forward to in the future, and how we should prepare for it. What this book is missing is a ""humanity made stupid choices"" counter (I completely agreed when he made these statements). I hope that this format of answering complicated questions enlightens those who disagree with scientific facts. We need more people in this world believing scientists and supporting them.

If Hawking were still alive I'd ask, what if God is hiding in a parallel universe but He can see us perfectly well? What if He's inside a black hole? What if God is in all the particles of dark matter? What if He’s the fabric of space-time? What if He's inside us? What if He's the most important metaphor ever created by man come to life? What if He's any combination of those or even something else entirely? What then, Stephen? What could science have to say about any of that?"

180,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5112204-nuruddin-azri,4,"Hawking is one of the most influential scholars on physics and astronomy in 20th century. This book tackles the very fundamental questions of human being and nature although in this last book, he keeps asking the question of the existence of God (and denies it with a critical question on science and the origin of universe which he believes is the result of random collision).As an admirer of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin (Hawking also mentions Feynman, Heisenberg, Oppenheimer, Laplace, Hubble, Kant, Aristotle, Euclid, Hoyle and Dirac frequently), Hawking develops the theory pertaining black hole, space-time and quantum theory. Hawking saids, Einstein's Theory of Relativity concerns with the big things while the his Theory of Black Hole concerns with the micro things.Basically, there are three major themes when we come with the discourse of universe: matter, energy and space. According to Hawking, matter and energy is the same coin with a different facet. That is why the equation e=mc2 is so important. He also touches on the M-theory, how space and time are warped in the black hole and what is inside the black hole, all in an engaging way when he manages to blend the complex and intricate theory of physics with simple analogies and mentioning popular fictional science movies like Terminator, Star Trek, Jurassic Park and Interstellar.In the last chapter, Hawking answers the question of science and nature. Hawking is really positive with the future of science. He believes from now and in the future, more people need to study and travel to the other space and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute positively to the humankind with a cautious condition and wisdom in dealing with it.Like Einstein, Freud and other world-level scholars, Hawking coined back the importance of human to protect the nature because some of the big crises that make the nature imbalance in the modern world actually can be controlled by ourselves like deforestation, global warming, greenhouse effect, increase in human population, epidemic diseases, degradation of oceans, rapid extinction of other species and the need to develop renewable sources.With a very limited ability to move and write due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that he has, he should receive a world honour and praise with his excellent contribution to the understanding of the universe in general."

The thought that there is so much beyond us that we can barely begin to imagine it, makes me immensely fascinated. In addition to that, this school year I had an incredible Physiques teacher who made me completely fall in love with the subject. For those reasons, when I saw Brief Answers to the Big Questions on one of the bookshelves of my go-to bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it. I had tried reading another of Hawking's works, A Brief History of Time, but, unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it because I found it to be too complex for what I know about Physiques at the moment. However, that didn't deter me from picking up this book which I'm so glad I did.This book is Stephen Hawking's attempt to respond to some of the most common and intriguing questions people ask about space/the future.One of the many amazing aspects of this book is how Hawking takes the time to explain the numerous concepts as simple as possible in order for people who aren't familiarised with them to be able to understand. Unfortunately, there were still a few of them which I couldn't grasp which, despite might being my own fault, deterred me from giving this book 5 stars.Nevertheless, I loved learning about his perspective and opinion on the various matters touched upon this book and I definitely acquired some new knowledge through it.Moreover, the postscript written by his daughter Lucy was probably one of my favourite parts of the entire book. It made me cry and realise how much I looked up to this man as she spoke about him so fondly. He was truly a spectacular person and I'm truly grateful that I was alive at the same time as him, but deeply sorry he couldn't stay with us for longer.To sum up, I would highly recommend Brief Answers to the Big Questions if you're keen on reading about Hawking's views on some very important topics and learn more about the great universe we are a part of."

This man has inspired generations around the world to think about the big questions and to do so in a much more engaged and informed manner, how many can boast that?Following wonderful introductions from actor Eddie Redmayne and physicist Kip Thorne, we hear Hawking's views on everything from god and religion, artificial intelligence, interstellar travel, time travel, and the gravest issues facing humanity today.While you may not agree with some of his positions you will certainly enjoy the depth of thought he brings to every issue. When dealing with such a potent intellect, you of course realize that any work such as this is merely a précis to the voluminous contemplations that underly each of these positions. However, it has always been Hawking's unique skill to make the impenetrably difficult ideas accessible to the imaginations of everyone, he has maintained this ability now through his final work. "

By far one of the most brilliant minds to have graced this world, but also one of the most worthy people to have soared. He is on my list of people I wish I could have met, and I mourn his death. I liked the inclusion of interview clips where you could hear the ""voice"" he came to call his own. I also liked the fact that, even if he was explaining why another perspective didn't hold up, he never belittled--straightforward, respectful, and kind all the way.Some of you might know that, or possibly not, but I specialized in nonfiction for my creative writing degree and delved into science writing (which is widely varied by the way).

When the title said ""Brief Answers"" I guess I confused that with understandable answers. I don't know if it is just me, but I would go into this book not expecting to understand a large portion of it, and being okay with that. At first I tried to really understand all of the info and I felt a little lost and in over my head a bit but then I found that if I just read over the technical stuff but didn't focus too much on what I couldn't understand, I still came away with the message at the end of each chapter.

Stephen clearly explains his answers in succinct detail to ""Is there a God?"" to start the book with an encore-level question. He then follows it up with ""How did it all begin?"" and fully explains how Quantum allows some Positive Energy (=mc^2 a.k.a. galaxies and planets) added to some Negative Energy (Space - vacuum energy of expansion) still adds up to zero. Stephen's ""defense"" and rational surely holds up under the highest academic scrutiny.He went a little deep into question 5 about black holes, but I'll certainly allow myself to read this chapter twice. Stephen lies buried between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin with the Entropy of a Black Hole equation engraved on his tombstone (S=Akc^3 / 4Gh-bar). One would never know that we knew so much about these Black Holes!Stephen has the occasional jabs he is known for, with a few aimed at squarely at Trump. In ""How do we shape the future?"", we read: ""Education and science and technology research are endangered now more than ever before. ... The exchange of people across borders enables skills to transfer more quickly and brings new people with different ideas, derived from their different backgrounds. ...With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.""He gives credit to his teachers: Often that spark comes from a teacher. Allow me to explain. I wasn't the easiest person to teach, I was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy. But when I was fourteen my teacher at my school in St Albans, Dikran Tahta, showed me how to harness my energy and encouraged me to think creatively about mathematics. He opened my eyes to maths ats the blue-print of the universe itself. If you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher. When each of us thinks about what we can do in life, chances are we can do it because of a teacher.""Stephen describes the necessity to colonize space. ""We can make interstellar travel a long-term aim - in the next 200 to 500 years."" He describes the current rocket speed limitations of today and how the NEAREST star system (Alpha Centauri) would take 70,000 years of travel at the speed of Voyager. (Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years distance) ""If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump."" Then Stephen describes a plan starting with nano-size spacecraft that could reach speeds of 0.2c and be there in 20 years.Tempered with this optimism, is his realism about the world today: Earth resources draining too quickly. Climate change. Reduction of the polar ice caps. Deforestation. Over-population. Disease. War. Famine. Lack of water. Decimation of animal species. Yet in classic Hawking fashion, finishes this list with: 
""These are all solvable but so far have not been solved.""
Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question.
""It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

Out of all of the quotes I could post that one is my absolute favorite and really stood out to me the most. Overall, I can't say enough great things about this book and how much I enjoyed.

We are so easily distracted and stressed by the daily woes of economy, politics, religion, environment, but Hawking reminds us that in a few hundred years, super-humans will be zipping around the cosmos, settling on Mars etc. Life will be unimaginable to ours today!I loved listening to this on audio, each chapter has snippets of Hawking's own speaking, and there's also a lovely afterward by his daughter that is a fitting final tribute to a great man!"

194,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41705015-mounaim-kamel,5,"One of my favorites of all time, this is the last masterpiece authored by Stephen Hawking (2018), in this book he discusses some of the main questions of humanity like: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, What is inside a Black hole?, Is time travel possible?, Should we Colonize Space?, Will AI outsmart us?...etcThe first two chapters were as if I am reading a cookbook. Hawking was like ..ok guys! today I am gonna show you how to make a universe, and all we need is these ingredients: matter, energy and space, and all these 3 ingredients were invented at the moment of the big bang, From nothing, how? The secret lies in (Physics) something we call “negative energy”“Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of course he’s not just making a hill—he’s also making a hole………When the Big Bang produced a massive amount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. the positive and the negative add up to zero, always………... this negative energy is in space. This may sound odd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion, space itself is a vast store of negative energy.”All we need now is something to start this whole process, because everything that exists must have a cause that brought it into existence, right? Right?? Well..Here is where it gets a bit tricky.“in our daily lives .... You can’t just click your fingers and summon up a cup of coffee... But travel down into this coffee cup—through the milk particles, down to …the sub-atomic level, and you enter a world where conjuring something out of nothing is possible…at this scale, particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics. And they really can appear at random”and since we know the universe itself was once very small according to the big bang theory, this means that the universe itself could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature. it came into being on a minuscule scale out of nothingness with no “cause” beyond the laws of quantum mechanics, which allow for randomness. And then from that moment on, vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expanded, a place to store all the negative energy needed to make a balance.As you see, one thing that Hawking does well, is writing about science for the general reader, you don’t need to be a genius to understand his books, while he throws some jokes here and there which makes you feel like you are in the middle of a normal conversation with him. the only thing I didn’t like about the book is that it comes to an end."
195,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"​It took a long time for me to get through this book, not because it was difficult (Hawking always makes the most complex processes in the universe relatively simple) and not because it was dry or boring (Hawking is a truly superior writer who manages to relate to his audience and share with them his sense of awe about his personal life and life of the universe that surrounds us. I could not get through this book because I love Stephen Hawking, more than I can say. I was obsessed with his area theorem (which is what initially drew me to his work) and then I loved him all the more each time I read something he wrote. It did not matter that I did not know him personally. His death made me feel as if I had lost a friend and a favorite teacher. I surprised myself by how many times I cried while reading this book. It was just too painful to keep listening to his words, which remained her with us, even though he was gone. It didn't help that Hawking wrote about death quite a bit throughout the book. All of his insights were invaluable, but it was so sad to read his thoughts on death so soon after his actual death. This book, like his others, was a must read if you are a fan of physics. This short, very readable book of essays and answers covers topics including:Should we travel to space and colonize space? Should we develop AI​What are black holes; how do they work; what do we know and not know about them? (This is, without question, my favorite part of the book. No one writes about black holes like Hawking does. What a gifted writer!!!!!)What is escape velocity?How are particles and antiparticles made? (He has explained this many times, but this really did seem like the simplest, most concise explanation i have read from him.)What was his long career like, especially since he had so many challenges?Do we live in a predictable universe? (Exceptionally wonderful history of Laplacian determinism, which was replaced by chaos and quantum physics. Very simple explanation of Max Plank's work on packets of radiation- glorious writing, very simplified for the non-physicist. )What is quantum physics? (Such short answers, and yet, he seems to cover more ground and provide more complete answers than many authors who write much longer books.)Simple but eloquent explanation of the uncertainty principle. (Take home point was how Max Plank and Heisenberg challenged the idea of a deterministic universe).Can we predict everything about our future? (In theory the laws of physics allow us to do so, but the equations are far too complex.)"

But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly cannot continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last 300 years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts, and in particular the aggressive impulses, that we had in caveman days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the greenhouse effect becoming unstable.”― Stephen HawkingThis was a difficult book for me to review. How does one assign a rating to a book written by a legend in the scientific community, other to consider the ""readability"" of the material from my perspective? Although I have taken quite a few science classes, my areas of knowledge do not reside in the subjects of Theoretical Physics or Cosmology (meaning I'd be fine with reading something like Quantum Physics for Colossal Dummies). Hawking did a fine job of trying to make the subjects understandable to the lay person but the chapters devoted to black holes and time travel were still too scientifically intellectual for me. Perhaps I am a person who needs graphics and illustrations for certain subjects, as I lack the appropriate imagination.Even though I did not completely understand or enjoy all the subjects presented in the book, I admired Hawking's sense of humor, enthusiasm and optimism. He still managed to get in a few digs about the historical lack of intelligent behavior by the human race, which I couldn't disagree with. "

I stand with Hawking in that it is our responsibility to  all  become scientifically literate. Hawking walks us through how things came to be discovered, how they work, what we should look forward to in the future, and how we should prepare for it. What this book is missing is a ""humanity made stupid choices"" counter (I completely agreed when he made these statements). I hope that this format of answering complicated questions enlightens those who disagree with scientific facts. We need more people in this world believing scientists and supporting them.

But 1) skip all the introductions, 2) I wish scientists stopped opining on the concept of God in general on the basis of science specifically. If Hawking were still alive I'd ask, what if God is hiding in a parallel universe but He can see us perfectly well? What if He's inside a black hole? What if God is in all the particles of dark matter? What if He’s the fabric of space-time? What if He's inside us? What if He's the most important metaphor ever created by man come to life? What if He's any combination of those or even something else entirely? What then, Stephen? What could science have to say about any of that?"

His logic is refreshingly cool and a clear, his voice concerned and wise. Great quick listen."
210,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5112204-nuruddin-azri,4,"Hawking is one of the most influential scholars on physics and astronomy in 20th century. This book tackles the very fundamental questions of human being and nature although in this last book, he keeps asking the question of the existence of God (and denies it with a critical question on science and the origin of universe which he believes is the result of random collision).As an admirer of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin (Hawking also mentions Feynman, Heisenberg, Oppenheimer, Laplace, Hubble, Kant, Aristotle, Euclid, Hoyle and Dirac frequently), Hawking develops the theory pertaining black hole, space-time and quantum theory. Hawking saids, Einstein's Theory of Relativity concerns with the big things while the his Theory of Black Hole concerns with the micro things.Basically, there are three major themes when we come with the discourse of universe: matter, energy and space. According to Hawking, matter and energy is the same coin with a different facet. That is why the equation e=mc2 is so important. He also touches on the M-theory, how space and time are warped in the black hole and what is inside the black hole, all in an engaging way when he manages to blend the complex and intricate theory of physics with simple analogies and mentioning popular fictional science movies like Terminator, Star Trek, Jurassic Park and Interstellar.In the last chapter, Hawking answers the question of science and nature. Hawking is really positive with the future of science. He believes from now and in the future, more people need to study and travel to the other space and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute positively to the humankind with a cautious condition and wisdom in dealing with it.Like Einstein, Freud and other world-level scholars, Hawking coined back the importance of human to protect the nature because some of the big crises that make the nature imbalance in the modern world actually can be controlled by ourselves like deforestation, global warming, greenhouse effect, increase in human population, epidemic diseases, degradation of oceans, rapid extinction of other species and the need to develop renewable sources.With a very limited ability to move and write due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that he has, he should receive a world honour and praise with his excellent contribution to the understanding of the universe in general."

The thought that there is so much beyond us that we can barely begin to imagine it, makes me immensely fascinated. In addition to that, this school year I had an incredible Physiques teacher who made me completely fall in love with the subject. For those reasons, when I saw Brief Answers to the Big Questions on one of the bookshelves of my go-to bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it. I had tried reading another of Hawking's works, A Brief History of Time, but, unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it because I found it to be too complex for what I know about Physiques at the moment. However, that didn't deter me from picking up this book which I'm so glad I did.This book is Stephen Hawking's attempt to respond to some of the most common and intriguing questions people ask about space/the future.One of the many amazing aspects of this book is how Hawking takes the time to explain the numerous concepts as simple as possible in order for people who aren't familiarised with them to be able to understand. Unfortunately, there were still a few of them which I couldn't grasp which, despite might being my own fault, deterred me from giving this book 5 stars.Nevertheless, I loved learning about his perspective and opinion on the various matters touched upon this book and I definitely acquired some new knowledge through it.Moreover, the postscript written by his daughter Lucy was probably one of my favourite parts of the entire book. It made me cry and realise how much I looked up to this man as she spoke about him so fondly. He was truly a spectacular person and I'm truly grateful that I was alive at the same time as him, but deeply sorry he couldn't stay with us for longer.To sum up, I would highly recommend Brief Answers to the Big Questions if you're keen on reading about Hawking's views on some very important topics and learn more about the great universe we are a part of."

This man has inspired generations around the world to think about the big questions and to do so in a much more engaged and informed manner, how many can boast that?Following wonderful introductions from actor Eddie Redmayne and physicist Kip Thorne, we hear Hawking's views on everything from god and religion, artificial intelligence, interstellar travel, time travel, and the gravest issues facing humanity today.While you may not agree with some of his positions you will certainly enjoy the depth of thought he brings to every issue. When dealing with such a potent intellect, you of course realize that any work such as this is merely a précis to the voluminous contemplations that underly each of these positions. However, it has always been Hawking's unique skill to make the impenetrably difficult ideas accessible to the imaginations of everyone, he has maintained this ability now through his final work. "

By far one of the most brilliant minds to have graced this world, but also one of the most worthy people to have soared. He is on my list of people I wish I could have met, and I mourn his death. I liked the inclusion of interview clips where you could hear the ""voice"" he came to call his own. I also liked the fact that, even if he was explaining why another perspective didn't hold up, he never belittled--straightforward, respectful, and kind all the way.Some of you might know that, or possibly not, but I specialized in nonfiction for my creative writing degree and delved into science writing (which is widely varied by the way). I wish I had been able to read this book among my classmates because it truly is an interesting little work packed full of interesting and wholesome ideas.

When the title said ""Brief Answers"" I guess I confused that with understandable answers. I don't know if it is just me, but I would go into this book not expecting to understand a large portion of it, and being okay with that. At first I tried to really understand all of the info and I felt a little lost and in over my head a bit but then I found that if I just read over the technical stuff but didn't focus too much on what I couldn't understand, I still came away with the message at the end of each chapter.

Stephen clearly explains his answers in succinct detail to ""Is there a God?"" to start the book with an encore-level question. He then follows it up with ""How did it all begin?"" and fully explains how Quantum allows some Positive Energy (=mc^2 a.k.a. galaxies and planets) added to some Negative Energy (Space - vacuum energy of expansion) still adds up to zero. Stephen's ""defense"" and rational surely holds up under the highest academic scrutiny.He went a little deep into question 5 about black holes, but I'll certainly allow myself to read this chapter twice. Stephen lies buried between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin with the Entropy of a Black Hole equation engraved on his tombstone (S=Akc^3 / 4Gh-bar). One would never know that we knew so much about these Black Holes!Stephen has the occasional jabs he is known for, with a few aimed at squarely at Trump. In ""How do we shape the future?"", we read: ""Education and science and technology research are endangered now more than ever before. ... The exchange of people across borders enables skills to transfer more quickly and brings new people with different ideas, derived from their different backgrounds. ...With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.""He gives credit to his teachers: Often that spark comes from a teacher. Allow me to explain. I wasn't the easiest person to teach, I was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy. But when I was fourteen my teacher at my school in St Albans, Dikran Tahta, showed me how to harness my energy and encouraged me to think creatively about mathematics. He opened my eyes to maths ats the blue-print of the universe itself. If you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher. When each of us thinks about what we can do in life, chances are we can do it because of a teacher.""Stephen describes the necessity to colonize space. ""We can make interstellar travel a long-term aim - in the next 200 to 500 years."" He describes the current rocket speed limitations of today and how the NEAREST star system (Alpha Centauri) would take 70,000 years of travel at the speed of Voyager. (Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years distance) ""If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump."" Then Stephen describes a plan starting with nano-size spacecraft that could reach speeds of 0.2c and be there in 20 years.Tempered with this optimism, is his realism about the world today: Earth resources draining too quickly. Climate change. Reduction of the polar ice caps. Deforestation. Over-population. Disease. War. Famine. Lack of water. Decimation of animal species. Yet in classic Hawking fashion, finishes this list with: 
""These are all solvable but so far have not been solved.""
Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question.
""It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

4 stars. Such a delightful listen. It's educational and entertaining and full of wit. Hawking was a brilliant man and he had a great sense of humor and it shines here. In between the chapters are little interviews with Hawking and he was so quick witted in his responses and those sections were easily my favorite part of the book. There are a lot of really great quotes in this book. He had a very interesting outlook on life. I loved that this was primarily about Physics but also we get a bit of his personal life thrown in there as well. 
“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

Out of all of the quotes I could post that one is my absolute favorite and really stood out to me the most. Overall, I can't say enough great things about this book and how much I enjoyed.

It can be done.I am uncomfortably, acutely aware of the passage of time, and have lived much of my life with a sense that the time that I have been granted is, as they say, borrowedAs we stand on the brink of a Second Nuclear Age and a period of unprecedented climate change, scientists have a special responsibility, once again, to inform the public and to advise leaders about the perils that humanity faceWe can be an ignorant, unthinking lot. When we have reached similar crises in our history, there has usually been somewhere else to colonise. Columbus did it in 1492 when he discovered the New World. But now there is no new world. No Utopia around the corner. We are running out of space and the only places to go to are other worlds.One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will therefore survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a raceIf there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump.We must not fear change. We need to make it work to our advantage.Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let’s make sure that wisdom wins.So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

224,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41705015-mounaim-kamel,5,"One of my favorites of all time, this is the last masterpiece authored by Stephen Hawking (2018), in this book he discusses some of the main questions of humanity like: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, What is inside a Black hole?, Is time travel possible?, Should we Colonize Space?, Will AI outsmart us?...etcThe first two chapters were as if I am reading a cookbook. Hawking was like ..ok guys! today I am gonna show you how to make a universe, and all we need is these ingredients: matter, energy and space, and all these 3 ingredients were invented at the moment of the big bang, From nothing, how? The secret lies in (Physics) something we call “negative energy”“Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of course he’s not just making a hill—he’s also making a hole………When the Big Bang produced a massive amount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. the positive and the negative add up to zero, always………... this negative energy is in space. This may sound odd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion, space itself is a vast store of negative energy.”All we need now is something to start this whole process, because everything that exists must have a cause that brought it into existence, right? Right?? Well..Here is where it gets a bit tricky.“in our daily lives .... You can’t just click your fingers and summon up a cup of coffee... But travel down into this coffee cup—through the milk particles, down to …the sub-atomic level, and you enter a world where conjuring something out of nothing is possible…at this scale, particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics. And they really can appear at random”and since we know the universe itself was once very small according to the big bang theory, this means that the universe itself could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature. it came into being on a minuscule scale out of nothingness with no “cause” beyond the laws of quantum mechanics, which allow for randomness. And then from that moment on, vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expanded, a place to store all the negative energy needed to make a balance.As you see, one thing that Hawking does well, is writing about science for the general reader, you don’t need to be a genius to understand his books, while he throws some jokes here and there which makes you feel like you are in the middle of a normal conversation with him. the only thing I didn’t like about the book is that it comes to an end."
225,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"​It took a long time for me to get through this book, not because it was difficult (Hawking always makes the most complex processes in the universe relatively simple) and not because it was dry or boring (Hawking is a truly superior writer who manages to relate to his audience and share with them his sense of awe about his personal life and life of the universe that surrounds us. I could not get through this book because I love Stephen Hawking, more than I can say. I was obsessed with his area theorem (which is what initially drew me to his work) and then I loved him all the more each time I read something he wrote. It did not matter that I did not know him personally. His death made me feel as if I had lost a friend and a favorite teacher. I surprised myself by how many times I cried while reading this book. It was just too painful to keep listening to his words, which remained her with us, even though he was gone. It didn't help that Hawking wrote about death quite a bit throughout the book. All of his insights were invaluable, but it was so sad to read his thoughts on death so soon after his actual death. This book, like his others, was a must read if you are a fan of physics. This short, very readable book of essays and answers covers topics including:Should we travel to space and colonize space? Should we develop AI​What are black holes; how do they work; what do we know and not know about them? (This is, without question, my favorite part of the book. No one writes about black holes like Hawking does. What a gifted writer!!!!!)What is escape velocity?How are particles and antiparticles made? (He has explained this many times, but this really did seem like the simplest, most concise explanation i have read from him.)What was his long career like, especially since he had so many challenges?Do we live in a predictable universe? (Exceptionally wonderful history of Laplacian determinism, which was replaced by chaos and quantum physics. Very simple explanation of Max Plank's work on packets of radiation- glorious writing, very simplified for the non-physicist. )What is quantum physics? (Such short answers, and yet, he seems to cover more ground and provide more complete answers than many authors who write much longer books.)Simple but eloquent explanation of the uncertainty principle. (Take home point was how Max Plank and Heisenberg challenged the idea of a deterministic universe).Can we predict everything about our future? (In theory the laws of physics allow us to do so, but the equations are far too complex.)"

But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly cannot continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last 300 years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts, and in particular the aggressive impulses, that we had in caveman days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the greenhouse effect becoming unstable.”― Stephen HawkingThis was a difficult book for me to review. How does one assign a rating to a book written by a legend in the scientific community, other to consider the ""readability"" of the material from my perspective? Although I have taken quite a few science classes, my areas of knowledge do not reside in the subjects of Theoretical Physics or Cosmology (meaning I'd be fine with reading something like Quantum Physics for Colossal Dummies). Hawking did a fine job of trying to make the subjects understandable to the lay person but the chapters devoted to black holes and time travel were still too scientifically intellectual for me. Perhaps I am a person who needs graphics and illustrations for certain subjects, as I lack the appropriate imagination.Even though I did not completely understand or enjoy all the subjects presented in the book, I admired Hawking's sense of humor, enthusiasm and optimism. He still managed to get in a few digs about the historical lack of intelligent behavior by the human race, which I couldn't disagree with. "

I stand with Hawking in that it is our responsibility to  all  become scientifically literate. Hawking walks us through how things came to be discovered, how they work, what we should look forward to in the future, and how we should prepare for it. What this book is missing is a ""humanity made stupid choices"" counter (I completely agreed when he made these statements). I hope that this format of answering complicated questions enlightens those who disagree with scientific facts. We need more people in this world believing scientists and supporting them.

But 1) skip all the introductions, 2) I wish scientists stopped opining on the concept of God in general on the basis of science specifically. If Hawking were still alive I'd ask, what if God is hiding in a parallel universe but He can see us perfectly well? What if He's inside a black hole? What if God is in all the particles of dark matter? What if He’s the fabric of space-time? What if He's inside us? What if He's the most important metaphor ever created by man come to life? What if He's any combination of those or even something else entirely? What then, Stephen? What could science have to say about any of that?"

His logic is refreshingly cool and a clear, his voice concerned and wise. Great quick listen."
240,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5112204-nuruddin-azri,4,"Hawking is one of the most influential scholars on physics and astronomy in 20th century. This book tackles the very fundamental questions of human being and nature although in this last book, he keeps asking the question of the existence of God (and denies it with a critical question on science and the origin of universe which he believes is the result of random collision).As an admirer of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin (Hawking also mentions Feynman, Heisenberg, Oppenheimer, Laplace, Hubble, Kant, Aristotle, Euclid, Hoyle and Dirac frequently), Hawking develops the theory pertaining black hole, space-time and quantum theory. Hawking saids, Einstein's Theory of Relativity concerns with the big things while the his Theory of Black Hole concerns with the micro things.Basically, there are three major themes when we come with the discourse of universe: matter, energy and space. According to Hawking, matter and energy is the same coin with a different facet. That is why the equation e=mc2 is so important. He also touches on the M-theory, how space and time are warped in the black hole and what is inside the black hole, all in an engaging way when he manages to blend the complex and intricate theory of physics with simple analogies and mentioning popular fictional science movies like Terminator, Star Trek, Jurassic Park and Interstellar.In the last chapter, Hawking answers the question of science and nature. Hawking is really positive with the future of science. He believes from now and in the future, more people need to study and travel to the other space and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute positively to the humankind with a cautious condition and wisdom in dealing with it.Like Einstein, Freud and other world-level scholars, Hawking coined back the importance of human to protect the nature because some of the big crises that make the nature imbalance in the modern world actually can be controlled by ourselves like deforestation, global warming, greenhouse effect, increase in human population, epidemic diseases, degradation of oceans, rapid extinction of other species and the need to develop renewable sources.With a very limited ability to move and write due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that he has, he should receive a world honour and praise with his excellent contribution to the understanding of the universe in general."

The thought that there is so much beyond us that we can barely begin to imagine it, makes me immensely fascinated. In addition to that, this school year I had an incredible Physiques teacher who made me completely fall in love with the subject. For those reasons, when I saw Brief Answers to the Big Questions on one of the bookshelves of my go-to bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it. I had tried reading another of Hawking's works, A Brief History of Time, but, unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it because I found it to be too complex for what I know about Physiques at the moment. However, that didn't deter me from picking up this book which I'm so glad I did.This book is Stephen Hawking's attempt to respond to some of the most common and intriguing questions people ask about space/the future.One of the many amazing aspects of this book is how Hawking takes the time to explain the numerous concepts as simple as possible in order for people who aren't familiarised with them to be able to understand. Unfortunately, there were still a few of them which I couldn't grasp which, despite might being my own fault, deterred me from giving this book 5 stars.Nevertheless, I loved learning about his perspective and opinion on the various matters touched upon this book and I definitely acquired some new knowledge through it.Moreover, the postscript written by his daughter Lucy was probably one of my favourite parts of the entire book. It made me cry and realise how much I looked up to this man as she spoke about him so fondly. He was truly a spectacular person and I'm truly grateful that I was alive at the same time as him, but deeply sorry he couldn't stay with us for longer.To sum up, I would highly recommend Brief Answers to the Big Questions if you're keen on reading about Hawking's views on some very important topics and learn more about the great universe we are a part of."

This man has inspired generations around the world to think about the big questions and to do so in a much more engaged and informed manner, how many can boast that?Following wonderful introductions from actor Eddie Redmayne and physicist Kip Thorne, we hear Hawking's views on everything from god and religion, artificial intelligence, interstellar travel, time travel, and the gravest issues facing humanity today.While you may not agree with some of his positions you will certainly enjoy the depth of thought he brings to every issue. When dealing with such a potent intellect, you of course realize that any work such as this is merely a précis to the voluminous contemplations that underly each of these positions. However, it has always been Hawking's unique skill to make the impenetrably difficult ideas accessible to the imaginations of everyone, he has maintained this ability now through his final work. "

By far one of the most brilliant minds to have graced this world, but also one of the most worthy people to have soared. He is on my list of people I wish I could have met, and I mourn his death. I liked the inclusion of interview clips where you could hear the ""voice"" he came to call his own. I also liked the fact that, even if he was explaining why another perspective didn't hold up, he never belittled--straightforward, respectful, and kind all the way.Some of you might know that, or possibly not, but I specialized in nonfiction for my creative writing degree and delved into science writing (which is widely varied by the way). I wish I had been able to read this book among my classmates because it truly is an interesting little work packed full of interesting and wholesome ideas.

When the title said ""Brief Answers"" I guess I confused that with understandable answers. I don't know if it is just me, but I would go into this book not expecting to understand a large portion of it, and being okay with that. At first I tried to really understand all of the info and I felt a little lost and in over my head a bit but then I found that if I just read over the technical stuff but didn't focus too much on what I couldn't understand, I still came away with the message at the end of each chapter.

Stephen clearly explains his answers in succinct detail to ""Is there a God?"" to start the book with an encore-level question. He then follows it up with ""How did it all begin?"" and fully explains how Quantum allows some Positive Energy (=mc^2 a.k.a. galaxies and planets) added to some Negative Energy (Space - vacuum energy of expansion) still adds up to zero. Stephen's ""defense"" and rational surely holds up under the highest academic scrutiny.He went a little deep into question 5 about black holes, but I'll certainly allow myself to read this chapter twice. Stephen lies buried between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin with the Entropy of a Black Hole equation engraved on his tombstone (S=Akc^3 / 4Gh-bar). One would never know that we knew so much about these Black Holes!Stephen has the occasional jabs he is known for, with a few aimed at squarely at Trump. In ""How do we shape the future?"", we read: ""Education and science and technology research are endangered now more than ever before. ... The exchange of people across borders enables skills to transfer more quickly and brings new people with different ideas, derived from their different backgrounds. ...With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.""He gives credit to his teachers: Often that spark comes from a teacher. Allow me to explain. I wasn't the easiest person to teach, I was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy. But when I was fourteen my teacher at my school in St Albans, Dikran Tahta, showed me how to harness my energy and encouraged me to think creatively about mathematics. He opened my eyes to maths ats the blue-print of the universe itself. If you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher. When each of us thinks about what we can do in life, chances are we can do it because of a teacher.""Stephen describes the necessity to colonize space. ""We can make interstellar travel a long-term aim - in the next 200 to 500 years."" He describes the current rocket speed limitations of today and how the NEAREST star system (Alpha Centauri) would take 70,000 years of travel at the speed of Voyager. (Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years distance) ""If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump."" Then Stephen describes a plan starting with nano-size spacecraft that could reach speeds of 0.2c and be there in 20 years.Tempered with this optimism, is his realism about the world today: Earth resources draining too quickly. Climate change. Reduction of the polar ice caps. Deforestation. Over-population. Disease. War. Famine. Lack of water. Decimation of animal species. Yet in classic Hawking fashion, finishes this list with: 
""These are all solvable but so far have not been solved.""
Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question.
""It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

4 stars. Such a delightful listen. It's educational and entertaining and full of wit. Hawking was a brilliant man and he had a great sense of humor and it shines here. In between the chapters are little interviews with Hawking and he was so quick witted in his responses and those sections were easily my favorite part of the book. There are a lot of really great quotes in this book. He had a very interesting outlook on life. I loved that this was primarily about Physics but also we get a bit of his personal life thrown in there as well. 
“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

It can be done.I am uncomfortably, acutely aware of the passage of time, and have lived much of my life with a sense that the time that I have been granted is, as they say, borrowedAs we stand on the brink of a Second Nuclear Age and a period of unprecedented climate change, scientists have a special responsibility, once again, to inform the public and to advise leaders about the perils that humanity faceWe can be an ignorant, unthinking lot. When we have reached similar crises in our history, there has usually been somewhere else to colonise. Columbus did it in 1492 when he discovered the New World. But now there is no new world. No Utopia around the corner. We are running out of space and the only places to go to are other worlds.One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will therefore survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a raceIf there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump.We must not fear change. We need to make it work to our advantage.Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let’s make sure that wisdom wins.So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

254,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41705015-mounaim-kamel,5,"One of my favorites of all time, this is the last masterpiece authored by Stephen Hawking (2018), in this book he discusses some of the main questions of humanity like: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, What is inside a Black hole?, Is time travel possible?, Should we Colonize Space?, Will AI outsmart us?...etcThe first two chapters were as if I am reading a cookbook. Hawking was like ..ok guys! today I am gonna show you how to make a universe, and all we need is these ingredients: matter, energy and space, and all these 3 ingredients were invented at the moment of the big bang, From nothing, how? The secret lies in (Physics) something we call “negative energy”“Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of course he’s not just making a hill—he’s also making a hole………When the Big Bang produced a massive amount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. the positive and the negative add up to zero, always………... this negative energy is in space. This may sound odd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion, space itself is a vast store of negative energy.”All we need now is something to start this whole process, because everything that exists must have a cause that brought it into existence, right? Right?? Well..Here is where it gets a bit tricky.“in our daily lives .... You can’t just click your fingers and summon up a cup of coffee... But travel down into this coffee cup—through the milk particles, down to …the sub-atomic level, and you enter a world where conjuring something out of nothing is possible…at this scale, particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics. And they really can appear at random”and since we know the universe itself was once very small according to the big bang theory, this means that the universe itself could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature. it came into being on a minuscule scale out of nothingness with no “cause” beyond the laws of quantum mechanics, which allow for randomness. And then from that moment on, vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expanded, a place to store all the negative energy needed to make a balance.As you see, one thing that Hawking does well, is writing about science for the general reader, you don’t need to be a genius to understand his books, while he throws some jokes here and there which makes you feel like you are in the middle of a normal conversation with him. the only thing I didn’t like about the book is that it comes to an end."
255,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"​It took a long time for me to get through this book, not because it was difficult (Hawking always makes the most complex processes in the universe relatively simple) and not because it was dry or boring (Hawking is a truly superior writer who manages to relate to his audience and share with them his sense of awe about his personal life and life of the universe that surrounds us. I could not get through this book because I love Stephen Hawking, more than I can say. I was obsessed with his area theorem (which is what initially drew me to his work) and then I loved him all the more each time I read something he wrote. It did not matter that I did not know him personally. His death made me feel as if I had lost a friend and a favorite teacher. I surprised myself by how many times I cried while reading this book. It was just too painful to keep listening to his words, which remained her with us, even though he was gone. It didn't help that Hawking wrote about death quite a bit throughout the book. All of his insights were invaluable, but it was so sad to read his thoughts on death so soon after his actual death. This book, like his others, was a must read if you are a fan of physics. This short, very readable book of essays and answers covers topics including:Should we travel to space and colonize space? Should we develop AI​What are black holes; how do they work; what do we know and not know about them? (This is, without question, my favorite part of the book. No one writes about black holes like Hawking does. What a gifted writer!!!!!)What is escape velocity?How are particles and antiparticles made? (He has explained this many times, but this really did seem like the simplest, most concise explanation i have read from him.)What was his long career like, especially since he had so many challenges?Do we live in a predictable universe? (Exceptionally wonderful history of Laplacian determinism, which was replaced by chaos and quantum physics. Very simple explanation of Max Plank's work on packets of radiation- glorious writing, very simplified for the non-physicist. )What is quantum physics? (Such short answers, and yet, he seems to cover more ground and provide more complete answers than many authors who write much longer books.)Simple but eloquent explanation of the uncertainty principle. (Take home point was how Max Plank and Heisenberg challenged the idea of a deterministic universe).Can we predict everything about our future? (In theory the laws of physics allow us to do so, but the equations are far too complex.)"

But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly cannot continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last 300 years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts, and in particular the aggressive impulses, that we had in caveman days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the greenhouse effect becoming unstable.”― Stephen HawkingThis was a difficult book for me to review. How does one assign a rating to a book written by a legend in the scientific community, other to consider the ""readability"" of the material from my perspective? Although I have taken quite a few science classes, my areas of knowledge do not reside in the subjects of Theoretical Physics or Cosmology (meaning I'd be fine with reading something like Quantum Physics for Colossal Dummies). Hawking did a fine job of trying to make the subjects understandable to the lay person but the chapters devoted to black holes and time travel were still too scientifically intellectual for me. Perhaps I am a person who needs graphics and illustrations for certain subjects, as I lack the appropriate imagination.Even though I did not completely understand or enjoy all the subjects presented in the book, I admired Hawking's sense of humor, enthusiasm and optimism. He still managed to get in a few digs about the historical lack of intelligent behavior by the human race, which I couldn't disagree with. "

I stand with Hawking in that it is our responsibility to  all  become scientifically literate. Hawking walks us through how things came to be discovered, how they work, what we should look forward to in the future, and how we should prepare for it. What this book is missing is a ""humanity made stupid choices"" counter (I completely agreed when he made these statements). I hope that this format of answering complicated questions enlightens those who disagree with scientific facts. We need more people in this world believing scientists and supporting them.

If Hawking were still alive I'd ask, what if God is hiding in a parallel universe but He can see us perfectly well? What if He's inside a black hole? What if God is in all the particles of dark matter? What if He’s the fabric of space-time? What if He's inside us? What if He's the most important metaphor ever created by man come to life? What if He's any combination of those or even something else entirely? What then, Stephen? What could science have to say about any of that?"

270,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5112204-nuruddin-azri,4,"Hawking is one of the most influential scholars on physics and astronomy in 20th century. This book tackles the very fundamental questions of human being and nature although in this last book, he keeps asking the question of the existence of God (and denies it with a critical question on science and the origin of universe which he believes is the result of random collision).As an admirer of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin (Hawking also mentions Feynman, Heisenberg, Oppenheimer, Laplace, Hubble, Kant, Aristotle, Euclid, Hoyle and Dirac frequently), Hawking develops the theory pertaining black hole, space-time and quantum theory. Hawking saids, Einstein's Theory of Relativity concerns with the big things while the his Theory of Black Hole concerns with the micro things.Basically, there are three major themes when we come with the discourse of universe: matter, energy and space. According to Hawking, matter and energy is the same coin with a different facet. That is why the equation e=mc2 is so important. He also touches on the M-theory, how space and time are warped in the black hole and what is inside the black hole, all in an engaging way when he manages to blend the complex and intricate theory of physics with simple analogies and mentioning popular fictional science movies like Terminator, Star Trek, Jurassic Park and Interstellar.In the last chapter, Hawking answers the question of science and nature. Hawking is really positive with the future of science. He believes from now and in the future, more people need to study and travel to the other space and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute positively to the humankind with a cautious condition and wisdom in dealing with it.Like Einstein, Freud and other world-level scholars, Hawking coined back the importance of human to protect the nature because some of the big crises that make the nature imbalance in the modern world actually can be controlled by ourselves like deforestation, global warming, greenhouse effect, increase in human population, epidemic diseases, degradation of oceans, rapid extinction of other species and the need to develop renewable sources.With a very limited ability to move and write due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that he has, he should receive a world honour and praise with his excellent contribution to the understanding of the universe in general."

The thought that there is so much beyond us that we can barely begin to imagine it, makes me immensely fascinated. In addition to that, this school year I had an incredible Physiques teacher who made me completely fall in love with the subject. For those reasons, when I saw Brief Answers to the Big Questions on one of the bookshelves of my go-to bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it. I had tried reading another of Hawking's works, A Brief History of Time, but, unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it because I found it to be too complex for what I know about Physiques at the moment. However, that didn't deter me from picking up this book which I'm so glad I did.This book is Stephen Hawking's attempt to respond to some of the most common and intriguing questions people ask about space/the future.One of the many amazing aspects of this book is how Hawking takes the time to explain the numerous concepts as simple as possible in order for people who aren't familiarised with them to be able to understand. Unfortunately, there were still a few of them which I couldn't grasp which, despite might being my own fault, deterred me from giving this book 5 stars.Nevertheless, I loved learning about his perspective and opinion on the various matters touched upon this book and I definitely acquired some new knowledge through it.Moreover, the postscript written by his daughter Lucy was probably one of my favourite parts of the entire book. It made me cry and realise how much I looked up to this man as she spoke about him so fondly. He was truly a spectacular person and I'm truly grateful that I was alive at the same time as him, but deeply sorry he couldn't stay with us for longer.To sum up, I would highly recommend Brief Answers to the Big Questions if you're keen on reading about Hawking's views on some very important topics and learn more about the great universe we are a part of."

This man has inspired generations around the world to think about the big questions and to do so in a much more engaged and informed manner, how many can boast that?Following wonderful introductions from actor Eddie Redmayne and physicist Kip Thorne, we hear Hawking's views on everything from god and religion, artificial intelligence, interstellar travel, time travel, and the gravest issues facing humanity today.While you may not agree with some of his positions you will certainly enjoy the depth of thought he brings to every issue. When dealing with such a potent intellect, you of course realize that any work such as this is merely a précis to the voluminous contemplations that underly each of these positions. However, it has always been Hawking's unique skill to make the impenetrably difficult ideas accessible to the imaginations of everyone, he has maintained this ability now through his final work. "

By far one of the most brilliant minds to have graced this world, but also one of the most worthy people to have soared. He is on my list of people I wish I could have met, and I mourn his death. I liked the inclusion of interview clips where you could hear the ""voice"" he came to call his own. I also liked the fact that, even if he was explaining why another perspective didn't hold up, he never belittled--straightforward, respectful, and kind all the way.Some of you might know that, or possibly not, but I specialized in nonfiction for my creative writing degree and delved into science writing (which is widely varied by the way).

When the title said ""Brief Answers"" I guess I confused that with understandable answers. I don't know if it is just me, but I would go into this book not expecting to understand a large portion of it, and being okay with that. At first I tried to really understand all of the info and I felt a little lost and in over my head a bit but then I found that if I just read over the technical stuff but didn't focus too much on what I couldn't understand, I still came away with the message at the end of each chapter.

Stephen clearly explains his answers in succinct detail to ""Is there a God?"" to start the book with an encore-level question. He then follows it up with ""How did it all begin?"" and fully explains how Quantum allows some Positive Energy (=mc^2 a.k.a. galaxies and planets) added to some Negative Energy (Space - vacuum energy of expansion) still adds up to zero. Stephen's ""defense"" and rational surely holds up under the highest academic scrutiny.He went a little deep into question 5 about black holes, but I'll certainly allow myself to read this chapter twice. Stephen lies buried between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin with the Entropy of a Black Hole equation engraved on his tombstone (S=Akc^3 / 4Gh-bar). One would never know that we knew so much about these Black Holes!Stephen has the occasional jabs he is known for, with a few aimed at squarely at Trump. In ""How do we shape the future?"", we read: ""Education and science and technology research are endangered now more than ever before. ... The exchange of people across borders enables skills to transfer more quickly and brings new people with different ideas, derived from their different backgrounds. ...With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.""He gives credit to his teachers: Often that spark comes from a teacher. Allow me to explain. I wasn't the easiest person to teach, I was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy. But when I was fourteen my teacher at my school in St Albans, Dikran Tahta, showed me how to harness my energy and encouraged me to think creatively about mathematics. He opened my eyes to maths ats the blue-print of the universe itself. If you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher. When each of us thinks about what we can do in life, chances are we can do it because of a teacher.""Stephen describes the necessity to colonize space. ""We can make interstellar travel a long-term aim - in the next 200 to 500 years."" He describes the current rocket speed limitations of today and how the NEAREST star system (Alpha Centauri) would take 70,000 years of travel at the speed of Voyager. (Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years distance) ""If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump."" Then Stephen describes a plan starting with nano-size spacecraft that could reach speeds of 0.2c and be there in 20 years.Tempered with this optimism, is his realism about the world today: Earth resources draining too quickly. Climate change. Reduction of the polar ice caps. Deforestation. Over-population. Disease. War. Famine. Lack of water. Decimation of animal species. Yet in classic Hawking fashion, finishes this list with: 
""These are all solvable but so far have not been solved.""
Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question.
""It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

4 stars. Such a delightful listen. It's educational and entertaining and full of wit. Hawking was a brilliant man and he had a great sense of humor and it shines here. In between the chapters are little interviews with Hawking and he was so quick witted in his responses and those sections were easily my favorite part of the book. There are a lot of really great quotes in this book. He had a very interesting outlook on life. I loved that this was primarily about Physics but also we get a bit of his personal life thrown in there as well. 
“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

Out of all of the quotes I could post that one is my absolute favorite and really stood out to me the most. Overall, I can't say enough great things about this book and how much I enjoyed.

It can be done.I am uncomfortably, acutely aware of the passage of time, and have lived much of my life with a sense that the time that I have been granted is, as they say, borrowedAs we stand on the brink of a Second Nuclear Age and a period of unprecedented climate change, scientists have a special responsibility, once again, to inform the public and to advise leaders about the perils that humanity faceWe can be an ignorant, unthinking lot. When we have reached similar crises in our history, there has usually been somewhere else to colonise. Columbus did it in 1492 when he discovered the New World. But now there is no new world. No Utopia around the corner. We are running out of space and the only places to go to are other worlds.One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will therefore survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a raceIf there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump.We must not fear change. We need to make it work to our advantage.Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it.

284,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41705015-mounaim-kamel,5,"One of my favorites of all time, this is the last masterpiece authored by Stephen Hawking (2018), in this book he discusses some of the main questions of humanity like: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, What is inside a Black hole?, Is time travel possible?, Should we Colonize Space?, Will AI outsmart us?...etcThe first two chapters were as if I am reading a cookbook. Hawking was like ..ok guys! today I am gonna show you how to make a universe, and all we need is these ingredients: matter, energy and space, and all these 3 ingredients were invented at the moment of the big bang, From nothing, how? The secret lies in (Physics) something we call “negative energy”“Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of course he’s not just making a hill—he’s also making a hole………When the Big Bang produced a massive amount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. the positive and the negative add up to zero, always………... this negative energy is in space. This may sound odd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion, space itself is a vast store of negative energy.”All we need now is something to start this whole process, because everything that exists must have a cause that brought it into existence, right? Right?? Well..Here is where it gets a bit tricky.“in our daily lives .... You can’t just click your fingers and summon up a cup of coffee... But travel down into this coffee cup—through the milk particles, down to …the sub-atomic level, and you enter a world where conjuring something out of nothing is possible…at this scale, particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics. And they really can appear at random”and since we know the universe itself was once very small according to the big bang theory, this means that the universe itself could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature. it came into being on a minuscule scale out of nothingness with no “cause” beyond the laws of quantum mechanics, which allow for randomness. And then from that moment on, vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expanded, a place to store all the negative energy needed to make a balance.As you see, one thing that Hawking does well, is writing about science for the general reader, you don’t need to be a genius to understand his books, while he throws some jokes here and there which makes you feel like you are in the middle of a normal conversation with him. the only thing I didn’t like about the book is that it comes to an end."
285,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"​It took a long time for me to get through this book, not because it was difficult (Hawking always makes the most complex processes in the universe relatively simple) and not because it was dry or boring (Hawking is a truly superior writer who manages to relate to his audience and share with them his sense of awe about his personal life and life of the universe that surrounds us. I could not get through this book because I love Stephen Hawking, more than I can say. I was obsessed with his area theorem (which is what initially drew me to his work) and then I loved him all the more each time I read something he wrote. It did not matter that I did not know him personally. His death made me feel as if I had lost a friend and a favorite teacher. I surprised myself by how many times I cried while reading this book. It was just too painful to keep listening to his words, which remained her with us, even though he was gone. It didn't help that Hawking wrote about death quite a bit throughout the book. All of his insights were invaluable, but it was so sad to read his thoughts on death so soon after his actual death. This book, like his others, was a must read if you are a fan of physics. This short, very readable book of essays and answers covers topics including:Should we travel to space and colonize space? Should we develop AI​What are black holes; how do they work; what do we know and not know about them? (This is, without question, my favorite part of the book. No one writes about black holes like Hawking does. What a gifted writer!!!!!)What is escape velocity?How are particles and antiparticles made? (He has explained this many times, but this really did seem like the simplest, most concise explanation i have read from him.)What was his long career like, especially since he had so many challenges?Do we live in a predictable universe? (Exceptionally wonderful history of Laplacian determinism, which was replaced by chaos and quantum physics. Very simple explanation of Max Plank's work on packets of radiation- glorious writing, very simplified for the non-physicist. )What is quantum physics? (Such short answers, and yet, he seems to cover more ground and provide more complete answers than many authors who write much longer books.)Simple but eloquent explanation of the uncertainty principle. (Take home point was how Max Plank and Heisenberg challenged the idea of a deterministic universe).Can we predict everything about our future? (In theory the laws of physics allow us to do so, but the equations are far too complex.)"

But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly cannot continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last 300 years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts, and in particular the aggressive impulses, that we had in caveman days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the greenhouse effect becoming unstable.”― Stephen HawkingThis was a difficult book for me to review. How does one assign a rating to a book written by a legend in the scientific community, other to consider the ""readability"" of the material from my perspective? Although I have taken quite a few science classes, my areas of knowledge do not reside in the subjects of Theoretical Physics or Cosmology (meaning I'd be fine with reading something like Quantum Physics for Colossal Dummies). Hawking did a fine job of trying to make the subjects understandable to the lay person but the chapters devoted to black holes and time travel were still too scientifically intellectual for me. Perhaps I am a person who needs graphics and illustrations for certain subjects, as I lack the appropriate imagination.Even though I did not completely understand or enjoy all the subjects presented in the book, I admired Hawking's sense of humor, enthusiasm and optimism. He still managed to get in a few digs about the historical lack of intelligent behavior by the human race, which I couldn't disagree with. "

I stand with Hawking in that it is our responsibility to  all  become scientifically literate. Hawking walks us through how things came to be discovered, how they work, what we should look forward to in the future, and how we should prepare for it. What this book is missing is a ""humanity made stupid choices"" counter (I completely agreed when he made these statements). I hope that this format of answering complicated questions enlightens those who disagree with scientific facts. We need more people in this world believing scientists and supporting them.

If Hawking were still alive I'd ask, what if God is hiding in a parallel universe but He can see us perfectly well? What if He's inside a black hole? What if God is in all the particles of dark matter? What if He’s the fabric of space-time? What if He's inside us? What if He's the most important metaphor ever created by man come to life? What if He's any combination of those or even something else entirely? What then, Stephen? What could science have to say about any of that?"

His logic is refreshingly cool and a clear, his voice concerned and wise. Great quick listen."
300,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5112204-nuruddin-azri,4,"Hawking is one of the most influential scholars on physics and astronomy in 20th century. This book tackles the very fundamental questions of human being and nature although in this last book, he keeps asking the question of the existence of God (and denies it with a critical question on science and the origin of universe which he believes is the result of random collision).As an admirer of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin (Hawking also mentions Feynman, Heisenberg, Oppenheimer, Laplace, Hubble, Kant, Aristotle, Euclid, Hoyle and Dirac frequently), Hawking develops the theory pertaining black hole, space-time and quantum theory. Hawking saids, Einstein's Theory of Relativity concerns with the big things while the his Theory of Black Hole concerns with the micro things.Basically, there are three major themes when we come with the discourse of universe: matter, energy and space. According to Hawking, matter and energy is the same coin with a different facet. That is why the equation e=mc2 is so important. He also touches on the M-theory, how space and time are warped in the black hole and what is inside the black hole, all in an engaging way when he manages to blend the complex and intricate theory of physics with simple analogies and mentioning popular fictional science movies like Terminator, Star Trek, Jurassic Park and Interstellar.In the last chapter, Hawking answers the question of science and nature. Hawking is really positive with the future of science. He believes from now and in the future, more people need to study and travel to the other space and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute positively to the humankind with a cautious condition and wisdom in dealing with it.Like Einstein, Freud and other world-level scholars, Hawking coined back the importance of human to protect the nature because some of the big crises that make the nature imbalance in the modern world actually can be controlled by ourselves like deforestation, global warming, greenhouse effect, increase in human population, epidemic diseases, degradation of oceans, rapid extinction of other species and the need to develop renewable sources.With a very limited ability to move and write due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that he has, he should receive a world honour and praise with his excellent contribution to the understanding of the universe in general."

The thought that there is so much beyond us that we can barely begin to imagine it, makes me immensely fascinated. In addition to that, this school year I had an incredible Physiques teacher who made me completely fall in love with the subject. For those reasons, when I saw Brief Answers to the Big Questions on one of the bookshelves of my go-to bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it. I had tried reading another of Hawking's works, A Brief History of Time, but, unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it because I found it to be too complex for what I know about Physiques at the moment. However, that didn't deter me from picking up this book which I'm so glad I did.This book is Stephen Hawking's attempt to respond to some of the most common and intriguing questions people ask about space/the future.One of the many amazing aspects of this book is how Hawking takes the time to explain the numerous concepts as simple as possible in order for people who aren't familiarised with them to be able to understand. Unfortunately, there were still a few of them which I couldn't grasp which, despite might being my own fault, deterred me from giving this book 5 stars.Nevertheless, I loved learning about his perspective and opinion on the various matters touched upon this book and I definitely acquired some new knowledge through it.Moreover, the postscript written by his daughter Lucy was probably one of my favourite parts of the entire book. It made me cry and realise how much I looked up to this man as she spoke about him so fondly. He was truly a spectacular person and I'm truly grateful that I was alive at the same time as him, but deeply sorry he couldn't stay with us for longer.To sum up, I would highly recommend Brief Answers to the Big Questions if you're keen on reading about Hawking's views on some very important topics and learn more about the great universe we are a part of."

This man has inspired generations around the world to think about the big questions and to do so in a much more engaged and informed manner, how many can boast that?Following wonderful introductions from actor Eddie Redmayne and physicist Kip Thorne, we hear Hawking's views on everything from god and religion, artificial intelligence, interstellar travel, time travel, and the gravest issues facing humanity today.While you may not agree with some of his positions you will certainly enjoy the depth of thought he brings to every issue. When dealing with such a potent intellect, you of course realize that any work such as this is merely a précis to the voluminous contemplations that underly each of these positions. However, it has always been Hawking's unique skill to make the impenetrably difficult ideas accessible to the imaginations of everyone, he has maintained this ability now through his final work. "

By far one of the most brilliant minds to have graced this world, but also one of the most worthy people to have soared. He is on my list of people I wish I could have met, and I mourn his death. I liked the inclusion of interview clips where you could hear the ""voice"" he came to call his own. I also liked the fact that, even if he was explaining why another perspective didn't hold up, he never belittled--straightforward, respectful, and kind all the way.Some of you might know that, or possibly not, but I specialized in nonfiction for my creative writing degree and delved into science writing (which is widely varied by the way).

When the title said ""Brief Answers"" I guess I confused that with understandable answers. I don't know if it is just me, but I would go into this book not expecting to understand a large portion of it, and being okay with that. At first I tried to really understand all of the info and I felt a little lost and in over my head a bit but then I found that if I just read over the technical stuff but didn't focus too much on what I couldn't understand, I still came away with the message at the end of each chapter.

Stephen clearly explains his answers in succinct detail to ""Is there a God?"" to start the book with an encore-level question. He then follows it up with ""How did it all begin?"" and fully explains how Quantum allows some Positive Energy (=mc^2 a.k.a. galaxies and planets) added to some Negative Energy (Space - vacuum energy of expansion) still adds up to zero. Stephen's ""defense"" and rational surely holds up under the highest academic scrutiny.He went a little deep into question 5 about black holes, but I'll certainly allow myself to read this chapter twice. Stephen lies buried between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin with the Entropy of a Black Hole equation engraved on his tombstone (S=Akc^3 / 4Gh-bar). One would never know that we knew so much about these Black Holes!Stephen has the occasional jabs he is known for, with a few aimed at squarely at Trump. In ""How do we shape the future?"", we read: ""Education and science and technology research are endangered now more than ever before. ... The exchange of people across borders enables skills to transfer more quickly and brings new people with different ideas, derived from their different backgrounds. ...With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.""He gives credit to his teachers: Often that spark comes from a teacher. Allow me to explain. I wasn't the easiest person to teach, I was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy. But when I was fourteen my teacher at my school in St Albans, Dikran Tahta, showed me how to harness my energy and encouraged me to think creatively about mathematics. He opened my eyes to maths ats the blue-print of the universe itself. If you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher. When each of us thinks about what we can do in life, chances are we can do it because of a teacher.""Stephen describes the necessity to colonize space. ""We can make interstellar travel a long-term aim - in the next 200 to 500 years."" He describes the current rocket speed limitations of today and how the NEAREST star system (Alpha Centauri) would take 70,000 years of travel at the speed of Voyager. (Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years distance) ""If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump."" Then Stephen describes a plan starting with nano-size spacecraft that could reach speeds of 0.2c and be there in 20 years.Tempered with this optimism, is his realism about the world today: Earth resources draining too quickly. Climate change. Reduction of the polar ice caps. Deforestation. Over-population. Disease. War. Famine. Lack of water. Decimation of animal species. Yet in classic Hawking fashion, finishes this list with: 
""These are all solvable but so far have not been solved.""
Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question.
""It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

4 stars. Such a delightful listen. It's educational and entertaining and full of wit. Hawking was a brilliant man and he had a great sense of humor and it shines here. In between the chapters are little interviews with Hawking and he was so quick witted in his responses and those sections were easily my favorite part of the book. There are a lot of really great quotes in this book. He had a very interesting outlook on life. I loved that this was primarily about Physics but also we get a bit of his personal life thrown in there as well. 
“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

Out of all of the quotes I could post that one is my absolute favorite and really stood out to me the most. Overall, I can't say enough great things about this book and how much I enjoyed.

I was probably not the only person to get something in their eye while reading it.(And yes, you did contribute. More than you know.)"

We are all time travellers, journeying together into the future. But let us work together to make that future a place we want to visit.Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done.I am uncomfortably, acutely aware of the passage of time, and have lived much of my life with a sense that the time that I have been granted is, as they say, borrowedAs we stand on the brink of a Second Nuclear Age and a period of unprecedented climate change, scientists have a special responsibility, once again, to inform the public and to advise leaders about the perils that humanity faceWe can be an ignorant, unthinking lot. When we have reached similar crises in our history, there has usually been somewhere else to colonise. Columbus did it in 1492 when he discovered the New World. But now there is no new world. No Utopia around the corner. We are running out of space and the only places to go to are other worlds.One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will therefore survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a raceIf there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump.We must not fear change. We need to make it work to our advantage.Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let’s make sure that wisdom wins.So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

314,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41705015-mounaim-kamel,5,"One of my favorites of all time, this is the last masterpiece authored by Stephen Hawking (2018), in this book he discusses some of the main questions of humanity like: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, What is inside a Black hole?, Is time travel possible?, Should we Colonize Space?, Will AI outsmart us?...etcThe first two chapters were as if I am reading a cookbook. Hawking was like ..ok guys! today I am gonna show you how to make a universe, and all we need is these ingredients: matter, energy and space, and all these 3 ingredients were invented at the moment of the big bang, From nothing, how? The secret lies in (Physics) something we call “negative energy”“Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of course he’s not just making a hill—he’s also making a hole………When the Big Bang produced a massive amount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. the positive and the negative add up to zero, always………... this negative energy is in space. This may sound odd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion, space itself is a vast store of negative energy.”All we need now is something to start this whole process, because everything that exists must have a cause that brought it into existence, right? Right?? Well..Here is where it gets a bit tricky.“in our daily lives .... You can’t just click your fingers and summon up a cup of coffee... But travel down into this coffee cup—through the milk particles, down to …the sub-atomic level, and you enter a world where conjuring something out of nothing is possible…at this scale, particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics. And they really can appear at random”and since we know the universe itself was once very small according to the big bang theory, this means that the universe itself could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature. it came into being on a minuscule scale out of nothingness with no “cause” beyond the laws of quantum mechanics, which allow for randomness. And then from that moment on, vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expanded, a place to store all the negative energy needed to make a balance.As you see, one thing that Hawking does well, is writing about science for the general reader, you don’t need to be a genius to understand his books, while he throws some jokes here and there which makes you feel like you are in the middle of a normal conversation with him. the only thing I didn’t like about the book is that it comes to an end."
315,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"​It took a long time for me to get through this book, not because it was difficult (Hawking always makes the most complex processes in the universe relatively simple) and not because it was dry or boring (Hawking is a truly superior writer who manages to relate to his audience and share with them his sense of awe about his personal life and life of the universe that surrounds us. I could not get through this book because I love Stephen Hawking, more than I can say. I was obsessed with his area theorem (which is what initially drew me to his work) and then I loved him all the more each time I read something he wrote. It did not matter that I did not know him personally. His death made me feel as if I had lost a friend and a favorite teacher. I surprised myself by how many times I cried while reading this book. It was just too painful to keep listening to his words, which remained her with us, even though he was gone. It didn't help that Hawking wrote about death quite a bit throughout the book. All of his insights were invaluable, but it was so sad to read his thoughts on death so soon after his actual death. This book, like his others, was a must read if you are a fan of physics. This short, very readable book of essays and answers covers topics including:Should we travel to space and colonize space? Should we develop AI​What are black holes; how do they work; what do we know and not know about them? (This is, without question, my favorite part of the book. No one writes about black holes like Hawking does. What a gifted writer!!!!!)What is escape velocity?How are particles and antiparticles made? (He has explained this many times, but this really did seem like the simplest, most concise explanation i have read from him.)What was his long career like, especially since he had so many challenges?Do we live in a predictable universe? (Exceptionally wonderful history of Laplacian determinism, which was replaced by chaos and quantum physics. Very simple explanation of Max Plank's work on packets of radiation- glorious writing, very simplified for the non-physicist. )What is quantum physics? (Such short answers, and yet, he seems to cover more ground and provide more complete answers than many authors who write much longer books.)Simple but eloquent explanation of the uncertainty principle. (Take home point was how Max Plank and Heisenberg challenged the idea of a deterministic universe).Can we predict everything about our future? (In theory the laws of physics allow us to do so, but the equations are far too complex.)"

But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly cannot continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last 300 years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts, and in particular the aggressive impulses, that we had in caveman days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the greenhouse effect becoming unstable.”― Stephen HawkingThis was a difficult book for me to review. How does one assign a rating to a book written by a legend in the scientific community, other to consider the ""readability"" of the material from my perspective? Although I have taken quite a few science classes, my areas of knowledge do not reside in the subjects of Theoretical Physics or Cosmology (meaning I'd be fine with reading something like Quantum Physics for Colossal Dummies). Hawking did a fine job of trying to make the subjects understandable to the lay person but the chapters devoted to black holes and time travel were still too scientifically intellectual for me. Perhaps I am a person who needs graphics and illustrations for certain subjects, as I lack the appropriate imagination.Even though I did not completely understand or enjoy all the subjects presented in the book, I admired Hawking's sense of humor, enthusiasm and optimism. He still managed to get in a few digs about the historical lack of intelligent behavior by the human race, which I couldn't disagree with. "

I stand with Hawking in that it is our responsibility to  all  become scientifically literate. Hawking walks us through how things came to be discovered, how they work, what we should look forward to in the future, and how we should prepare for it. What this book is missing is a ""humanity made stupid choices"" counter (I completely agreed when he made these statements). I hope that this format of answering complicated questions enlightens those who disagree with scientific facts. We need more people in this world believing scientists and supporting them.

If Hawking were still alive I'd ask, what if God is hiding in a parallel universe but He can see us perfectly well? What if He's inside a black hole? What if God is in all the particles of dark matter? What if He’s the fabric of space-time? What if He's inside us? What if He's the most important metaphor ever created by man come to life?

He asks questions in this book that I haven't thought of like what is in a black hole. There is no definitive answer to this question, but I did learn that a black hole is a collasped star that does have gravitational power to suck in a human being. I learned that a black hole does trap in light and emit a lot of heat and radiation. Hawking supported living in space, and he supports his belief by telling readers there are ice caps in the craters on the moon and volcanic activity on the planet Mars. This may be old news to most people, but this is new information for me. It gives hope that people will eventually live in space and build colonies there. I really like the chapter where Hawking questions whether or not God exists. He did not believe in God, but he does asks readers what question they would ask God if they believe in his existence. This is a question that got me thinking about what I would ask. There are written tributes in this book by his daughter Lucy, actor Eddie Redmayne that all show how revered Stephen Hawking is.

I feel I have become physically , intellectually & spiritually smaller after reading this book.An enlightening read on some of the biggest questions faced by the mankind, the book is true to its title and does its job fairly well in answering the complex questions in a simple easy-to-understand language ,for most parts.I must admit though, occasionally there were some theories that just went above my noob head.God- defined as an embodiment of laws of nature and not as a subject to human relationship is an interesting perspective.With nanocraft & superhumans in action,the future seems to be an exciting & scary time/place.Beside the main subject, the impact of the possibility of early death on Stephen Hawking's life is clearly told in the book."

We are talking about his personal opinions, of course, but it's definitely interesting to hear the opinions of one of the greatest minds of the last century.To be honest, on occasion some of the scientific theories presented seemed a little far-fetched to me, even if they were presented as ""this is how things work, that experiment proved it"". But again, exposition of those theories is necessarily oversimplified (maybe even a little bit too much), so that was to be expected.Everybody should spend some time mulling over these questions every now and then. This book is a great opportunity to do just that."

This is not a very good book, to tell the truth, my truth that is. I certainly learned stuff from it, however, and liked it despite its problems, more or less, I guess that makes it good after all.For problems, I'll focus on two:- For one, the answers are not exactly brief. While this book, as far as I know, is directed to the general public, it does in depth more than needed. So while it is readable to the general public, that would make them less tempted to actually read it. I'd say that this book is directed to people with basic knowledge of physics, which is what allowed me to read it.- For two, the questions and their answers are not that fascinating. If you have knowledge of the ideas discussed, God's existence, Big Ban and time travel, do not expect something more than shedding new light on what you know already. Not that you cannot get more, I was certainly intrigued by the physics behind stuff I know from SciFi, and hearing it from no other than Stephen Hawking is different than Youtube.Speaking of Hawking, there are two main factors that make him who he is, to us readers of course. One is his fight with his condition, and two is his genius contribution to multiple fields, mainly cosmology and physics. He is, by all means, an extraordinary human being. One of the finest our race brought out. This book only vaguely touches those two points, however. This book could have been written by any of a large number of theoretical physicists with the same knowledge, at this level, and some of which would have been able to do it much better, make it shorter and briefer.That is my critique, but what do I know, better read and find out, chances are it won't be a waste of your time.*My interest in physics increases*"

Should we colonize space? Does God exist? These are just a few of the questions Hawking addresses in this wide-ranging, passionately argued final book from one of the greatest minds in history.Featuring a foreword by Eddie Redmayne, who won an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking, an introduction by Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne, and an afterword from Hawking’s daughter, Lucy, Brief Answers to the Big Questions is a brilliant last message to the world.Eminently readable, Hawking again delivers a delightful look at how the steady state theory was blasted into space when the expanding universe was proven. Of course, this means that the big crunch is certainly in the future, whether humans are still around then, or not. Refreshing as always, Hawking is a firm fave in our stuga.

339,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922102-blaine,4,"Brief Answers to the Big Questions was published after Stephen Hawking’s death. It’s an interesting mix of speculation and explanation of the underlying science. The book also does a great job of explaining how Professor Hawking’s study of black holes shed so much light on our understanding of quantum mechanics and science generally. As a collection of various writings, there is some overlap, and it repeats itself a bit. But if you’re looking for me to write a takedown of a legendary scientist who I’ve admired for most of my life, you have come to the wrong place.It’s not  A Brief History of Time, but a good read, and a fine entry point if you’ve never read anything before by Professor Hawking. Recommended.And now, the even Briefer Answers to the Big Questions:1. Is there a God? No, because there was no time before the beginning of the universe in which a creator could have acted.2. How did it all begin? Scientists are still working on it.3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Possibly, but unlikely. If so, they are either far away or have overlooked us, because if they had visited, it would likely be like the film Independence Day.4. Can we predict the future? The uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics make it too difficult.5. What is inside a black hole? Still unclear, as theoretical physicists are trying to resolve the information paradox.6. Is time travel possible? Theoretically we could create such wormholes, but if we really could, wouldn’t someone from the future have come back to visit or maybe show us how?7. We will survive on earth? Barring future disaster (asteroid, runaway climate change), yes, but humanity and machines will evolve in unrecognizable ways.8. Should we colonize space? Yes, if only to prevent our extinction, but also to boost interest in science generally.9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? Yes, it will be able eventually to design itself, and its evolution is far faster than our biological evolution. So we better make sure its goals align with ours. 10. How do we shape the future? “If you know how something works, you can control it.” Improve education generally and science education specifically."
340,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1778796-merry,5,"Where to begin? Especially when you’re reviewing a book by Stephen Hawking. Amazing, that’s a good start. Written in an incredibly down-to-earth manner (what s surprise considering how brilliant he was!), I have to admit there were moments I was still overwhelmed. It reminded me of some of those shows on tv about the universe where the absolute enormity of what they’re discussing becomes too much to comprehend even though it’s geared for “regular people.” And his delightful sense of humor! Every once in a while it would shine through as in this paragraph:“How do we start this journey? So far, our explorations have been limited to our local cosmic neighbourhood. Forty years on, our most intrepid explorer, Voyager, has just made it to interstellar space. Its speed, eleven miles a second, means it would take about 70,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri. This constellation is 4.37 light years away, twenty-five trillion miles. If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump.”Additionally he was quite a family man as he relates little snippets throughout the book and as evidenced by the touching words from his daughter at the end. All in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I close with his final thoughts:“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”"

I liked how the author views the world and you can plainly see how much he really enjoyed life and everything in it. I want to read more of Hawking's writing now."
342,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,"This was Stephen Hawking's last book published after his death in March 2018. he was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, proven by the fact that his ashes were buried in Westminster Abbey between Charles Darwin and Sir Isaac Newton. Here Hawking summarises his life's work by dealing with 8 Big Questions he contemplated in the past 50 years. His explanations are clear and rather forcefully presented. However, I don't think his reflections on the first 2 questions about the existence of God and how the world began will satisfy many believers. He essentially says that there was no need for God in order for the universe to be created and sustained. He doesn't belittle believers, but says that God is ""beside the point.""But no matter what your belief system is, this is a science book well worth reading-especially in the current American atmosphere where some of our political leaders think that science itself is ""beside the point."""

347,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660832-kevin,4,"I loved this book, Hawking’s last and most relevant it covers a range of questions about the universe, the earth, man and A.I.From the chapter on the existence of GodYou can’t get to a time before theBig Bang because there was no time before the Big Bang. Wehave finally found something that doesn’t have a cause,because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me thismeans that there is no possibility of a creator, because there isno time for a creator to have existed in.  From the chapter Will We Survive On Earth At the same time, many of those same politicians are denyingthe reality of man-made climate change, or at least the abilityof man to reverse it, just at the moment that our world isfacing a series of critical environmental crises. The danger isthat global warming may become self-sustaining, if it has notbecome so already.  From the chapter How Do We Shape the Future With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relationto immigration and the development of education, we arewitnessing a global revolt against experts, which includesscientists. So what can we do to secure the future of scienceand technology education?  Also from the chapter How Do We Shape the FutureAnd I believe the future of learning and education is theinternet. People can answer back and interact. In a way, theinternet connects us all together like the neurons in a giantbrain. And with such an IQ, what cannot we be capable of?  From the afterword by Lucy HawkingI thought it was perfectly normal to ask grown-ups lots ofchallenging questions because this is what we did at home. Itwas only when I allegedly reduced a vicar to tears with myclose examination of his proof of the existence of God that itstarted to dawn on me that this was unexpected.  I’d love to read a book from Lucy’s POV and see what growing up with her Dad was like, how it affected her life."
348,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58892455-read-by-coco,4,"I stumbled upon this book in my local bookstore with a friend of mine. She bought it (she doesn't usually read) and said it was interesting, so I picked it up! And she was right! While I feel like I had my own opinions about many of the topics talked about by Hawking in this book, the way he talked about it blew my mind. This book is and isn't opinion based. Hawkings, as you'd expect, has his opinions grounded in science. From reading this book its my personal opinion that he doesn't at all suffer from confirmation-bias. That is, instead of finding facts to back up his opinions, he uses the science he has learned to form his opinions. He also states that one of his great loves in his life is explaining and presenting difficult to understand theories and knowledge in a way that is easy for the average person to interperate, and this book sums up this love perfectly. While this book still is filled with difficult to understand scientific concepts, Hawking uses analogies and simple language to present these concepts in a way I could easily understand. Not only could I understand them, but I could also ponder them and further think on them. Hawking has a really unique and intelligent perspective on some of the big questions. While I wasn't super interested in learning what is inside a black hole, I was blown away by the way he explains and discusses the topics of religion, aliens, time travel, how the universe began, etc. Thesse topics interest me so much. And Im so thankful that Hawking took his time to share his opinions on these topics before his passing. His mind was brilliant, and its truly a gift to get a peek into how he see's the world, and to understand why he sees it that way. I really liked this book, so I'm giving it a solid four star rating.🌟🌟🌟🌟"
349,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking“Brief Answers to the Big Questions” addresses the big questions of the day by scientists, political leaders and the general public. World-famous cosmologist and award-winning author Stephen Hawking takes the readers on his final ride to answering some of the most interesting questions facing humankind. This instructive 227-page book includes the following ten chapters: Chapter 1: Is There a God? Chapter 2: How Did It All Begin? Chapter 3: Is There Other Intelligent Life in the Universe? Chapter 4: Can We Predict the Future? Chapter 5: What Is Inside a Black Hole? Chapter 6: Is Time Travel Possible? Chapter 7: Will We Survive on Earth? Chapter 8: Should We Colonise Space? Chapter 9: Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us? Chapter 10: How Do We Shape the Future?Positives:1.	Professionally written, accessible, brief and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of the big questions facing humankind from the masterful mind of Stephen Hawking.3.	The book is a compilation of Hawking’s answers to ten big questions. The book follows a clean pattern of asking the big question (one per chapter), discussion and summary. 4.	 Kip Thorne provides a warm introduction that captures the essence of Hawking. “This “Hawking temperature” of a black hole and its “Hawking radiation” (as they came to be called) were truly radical—perhaps the most radical theoretical physics discovery in the second half of the twentieth century. They opened our eyes to profound connections between general relativity (black holes), thermodynamics (the physics of heat) and quantum physics (the creation of particles where before there were none).”5.	There is a sense of awe that drives Hawking’s curiosity. “When we see the Earth from space, we see ourselves as a whole. We see the unity, and not the divisions. It is such a simple image with a compelling message; one planet, one human race.”6.	A look back at his illness, words of wisdom. “After my expectations had been reduced to zero, every new day became a bonus, and I began to appreciate everything I did have. While there’s life, there is hope.”7.	So is there a God? Spoiler alert. “One could define God as the embodiment of the laws of nature. However, this is not what most people would think of as God. They mean a human-like being, with whom one can have a personal relationship. When you look at the vast size of the universe, and how insignificant and accidental human life is in it, that seems most implausible.”8.	Complex topics made accessible. “You can’t get to a time before the Big Bang because there was no time before the Big Bang. We have finally found something that doesn’t have a cause, because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means that there is no possibility of a creator, because there is no time for a creator to have existed in.”9.	Key concepts defined. “Anthropic Principle, the idea that our theories about the universe must be compatible with our own existence.”10.	Provocative observations. “We are used to thinking of intelligent life as an inevitable consequence of evolution, but what if it isn’t? The Anthropic Principle should warn us to be wary of such arguments. It is more likely that evolution is a random process, with intelligence as only one of a large number of possible outcomes.”11.	The difficulty in predicting the future. “In practice, however, our ability to predict the future is severely limited by the complexity of the equations, and the fact that they often have a property called chaos.”12.	A discussion on the black hole. “The black holes are still characterised only by their overall mass, electric charge and spin outside the event horizon but the event horizon itself contains the information needed to tell us about what has fallen into the black hole in a way that goes beyond these three characteristics the black hole has. People are still working on these issues and therefore the information paradox remains unresolved. But I am optimistic that we are moving towards a solution. Watch this space.”13.	The uncertainty principle plays a prominent role in this book. “The reason quantum theory can allow the energy density to be negative is that it is based on the Uncertainty Principle. This says that certain quantities like the position and speed of a particle can’t both have well-defined values.”14.	Is time travel possible? Spoiler alert. “In conclusion, rapid space travel and travel back in time can’t be ruled out according to our present understanding. They would cause great logical problems, so let’s hope there’s a Chronology Protection Law to prevent people going back and killing their parents. But science-fiction fans need not lose heart. There’s hope in M-theory.”15.	Interesting observations on the biggest threats to humanity. “First, the Earth is becoming too small for us. Our physical resources are being drained at an alarming rate. We have presented our planet with the disastrous gift of climate change. Rising temperatures, reduction of the polar ice caps, deforestation, over-population, disease, war, famine, lack of water and decimation of animal species; these are all solvable but so far have not been solved.”16.	The need to colonize space. “I was quoted at the time as saying that I feared the human race is not going to have a future if we don’t go into space. I believed it then, and I believe it still.”17.	A fascinating look at artificial intelligence. “In short, the advent of super-intelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. The real risk with AI isn’t malice but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours we’re in trouble.”18.	The future of humanity. “We have two options for the future of humanity as I see it: first, the exploration of space for alternative planets on which to live, and second, the positive use of artificial intelligence to improve our world.”Negatives:1.	No supplementary materials.2.	No links to supporting information.3.	Meant for the masses so lacks depth.4.	Not at the same level as some of his previous books and that’s ok. In summary, this is a fun and instructive book to read. Hawking provides his succinct answers to the big questions facing humankind. The key to this book is that it was written for the masses, Hawking intends to educate and inspire. If you are looking for a book to whet your appetite, this is it. I recommend it. Further recommendations: “The Grand Design” by same author, “Why Does E=mc2?” and “Wonders of the Universe” by Brian Cox, “The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe” by Steven Novella, “Relativity” by Albert Einstein, “The Big Picture” by Sean Carroll, “Cosmos” by Carl Sagan, “A Universe from Nothing” and “The Greatest Story Ever Told – So Far” by Lawrence Krauss, “The Future of Humanity” Michio Kaku, and “Origins” and “Death by Black Hole” by Neil deGrasse Tyson.

350,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23360457-mihai-leonte,2,"The author's enthusiasm for knowledge and science is contagious. However I think the book is targeted towards a younger audience which might explain the lack of more thorough insights into the topics he selected. More disappointing for me was the choice of some of these topics - some of them are covered very superficially and sometimes even with a surprising one-sidedness. As I recently finished Factfulness by Hans Rosling - where he explains how the population increase is slowing down and experts having good reason to believe that it will again plateau in the future - I was stunned to hear Hawking exaggerate this danger over and over again. And unfortunately this was not the only topic on which he is not an expert and yet gives his opinion and presents it as fact. He covers religion, AI, social politics with a very broad brush and a very self assured tone: ""Time didn't exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in."" Hawking's concept of God as being part of creation is different to the definition most people/religions have, so his argument feels incomplete. The editing is poor and makes the book feel rushed - which it might have been the case. Maybe they tried to capitalize on a great man's passing by having a new book quickly available. I'm being cynical, but I can't find a better reason why there are so many paragraphs being repeated in different chapters."

355,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20934206-karthick,5,"Stephen Hawking will always be my greatest mentor after Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman.Thank you sir :)Its a compilation of some big and greatest questions and answers, public need to know. Is there a God?Our ancestors wanted a reason to believe in the creation. Religion, scriptures and stories were the tool for them to believe in and it actually comforted them. Unlike religion or god, Science provide you the understanding of the universe with a rational framework.Law of nature cannot be broken. For creation all you needed was matter, Energy and space. Where they come from? - from Big Bang. You can actually get a whole universe for free, an ultimate free lunch, so a creator was not needed. (Negative energy is an interesting topic to look into, because space itself is a vast store of negative energy and it involves in time travel, wormholes etc.)Nothing caused Big bang. There was no time before big bang, so the creator. Time didn’t exist before the big bang so there is no time for god to make the universe.How did it all begin?Ireland Archbishop Ussher’s claim on beginning of time was on 22 October 4004 BC at 6pm. But now it’s been discovered that the Universe is 13.8 billion years old and earth is 4.5 billion years old, proved by Cosmic microwave background and Rock radiometric dating respectively.Edwin Hubble discovered that universe is expanding by looking at the faint patches of light as they are far away. As galaxies are moving away, the light from them would take billion year to reach us. S, going in reverse of Big bang Theory, the universe must have begun from an extremely dense and high-energy ball (a singularity) which inflated, and galaxies and stars are formed. Hawking claims that in order to understand the origin of the universe, one has to incorporate the uncertainty principle and general theory of relativity which is still a great challenge in theoretical physics.According to Stephen-hawking-Hartle state (No Boundary proposal), what came before Big bang is meaningless, there was no time and there was nothing. And everything became a concept right after the Big bang. During inflation, some regions of the universe had higher density than others which led to the formation of galaxies and stars due to the gravitation attraction and slow expansion. Is there other intelligent life in universe?Our Universe entropy increase with time, means, the disorder increases as universe is still expanding. The same chaos happened in the name of random mutation and it took millions of years (Genes mutation, Brain development etc..) for the evolution of human with intelligence. It evolved from our mammal ancestors who survived the impact of the asteroid which wiped our dinosaur species some 60 million years ago and we are here because they survived. Self-reproducing systems like cells or microorganisms may be alive in any corner of any of the planets. But the possibility of intelligent life is very low as random process is more likely to happen, but evolution of intelligence is a very rare outcome of it.  Can we predict the future?Einstein objected the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics, especially Uncertainty principle which defined you cannot measure both position and speed of a particle simultaneously. Einstein believed in determinism and proposed Hidden Variable theory explains that object is directly influenced by its immediate surroundings. He said, ‘God doesn’t play dice’. But John Bell’s experiment and result were inconsistent with Hidden variable theory and it was disproved.Erwin Schrodinger introduced wave function and it represents both position and speed of a particle. The size of wave function gives the probability of particle will be found at that position. The variation rate of wave function gives the speed of the particle. Wave function is strongly peaked in a small region and both position and speed can be determined by Schrodinger equation. So, it’s still possible to predict. What is inside black hole?Well we don’t know yet. A star weights millions of times of mass of the sun when its gravity wins over nuclear thermal pressure, star compresses having unbelievable density and then it explodes and so the black hole is formed. Black hole is a region of space time which has enormous amount of gravity nothing would escape. Einstein equation cannot be defined at the point of singularity with infinite density.Roger Penrose proposed cosmic censorship conjecture tells that all singularities are hidden from view inside the black hole, we cannot observe from the rest of space time. But Black hole emits particle and radiation. All you can know is black hole’s mass, electric charge and spin. So sorry! we don’t know what is inside the black hole for now.  Is time travel possible?Time travel to the past is not possible. to future? Yes. If you travel at speed of light (299 792 458 m/s). Casimir effect shows that virtual particles pop into existence and energy density is negative. Quantum theory allows the energy density to be negative, providing it is positive in other and field can’t be exactly zero as it violates Uncertainty principle (Position and speed of a particle cannot be measured at the same time). So, combining both theory of relativity (bending of light, curved space time) and Quantum theory & Casimir effect (space time wrap in negative direction), we can travel to past by constructing wormhole.But Stephen Hawking proposed a hypothesis called “Chronology Protection Conjecture” proposes that the law of physics conspire to prevent time travel on a macroscopic scale.But M theory offers the 11 dimensions concept, where 7 dimensions are curled up into a space so small that we can’t even notice them. But M theory is our best hope to tie General Relativity with Quantum theory. In future, it may give rise to many things we don’t know yet and it may open unbelievable possibilities.Will we survive on earth?Definitely NO. Asteroid Collision, Nuclear War, Over Population, Deforestation, Famine, Animal Species Extinction, Climate Change, Artificial Intelligence, Pandemic Disease and list goes on. Sooner or later, Nature will throw a combined of any of above to sweep out the human race, if we don’t alert ourselves to stop doing the unnecessary risks we are into. Stephen hawking is more convinced that “humans need to leave the earth. If we stay, we risk being annihilated”. Should we colonize space?‘Not to leave planet earth would be like castaway on a desert island not trying to escape”.We should Colonize. Base on Moon by 2050, Manned Landing on Mars by 2070 (No worries! We have Elon Musk to take care of it). We are not going to have future, if we don’t go into space.Come on Guys! Moon & Mars are our Jackpot. And in future (say in 300-500 years), we may have interstellar travel (Fuel energy from Nuclear fusion or matter-antimatter annihilation) crossing across different space to find planets with Goldilocks zone (water and supportive atmosphere) and solar system like ours. We will.Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?People asked a computer, ‘Is there a god?’And the computer said, ‘There is now’, and fused the plug.Civilization is the product of human intelligence and so Artificial Intelligence. Even computer has its own set of evolution, but it had set by human brain. Considering the growth of Technology, dismissing or taking AI for granted will be a potential mistake. AI will surpass human and it will not be a surprising news that AI would take off on its own and redesign itself at a rate which couldn’t even compare to human slow biological evolution. British Mathematician Irving Good hypothesis ‘technological singularity’ would come true one day that a powerful super intelligence will surpass human intelligence, results in human extinction, unless we have a Kill Switch.  How do we space the future?Indisputably, Science is the answer for the all queries in the past, the present and the future. It is the part of our daily lives. Future lies in the hand of schools and inspiring teachers giving a better education and providing the scientific temper. We must engage fully with the study of science at an early level so can give our potential. Let’s be scientifically literate and inspire the young generation to create a better world for the whole human race."
356,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,5,"What can be better than this?! Stephen's last book is just perfect! If you are going to buy this book, buy the Barnes & Noble Exclusive Edition as it includes the bonus content of five tributes from notable friends of Stephen. In Brief Answers to the Big Questions Stephen answers ten of humankind's most pressing questions succinctly with a combination of incredible scientific insight and humor. His arguments are presented in easy-to-digest twenty-or-so page chapters. Stephen is writing for the layperson so most of this book is accessible to the average science enthusiast, although some of the subjects required more of a deep dive and my head was sent spinning like it did while reading his  A Brief History of Time. Some of my favorite chapters were: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?, and Will we survive on Earth?. While Stephen isn't an expert in all of the ten subjects he writes about in this book, he has a unique insight and presents interesting rationalizations for each. He also writes about his expertise in What is inside a black hole?, and Is time travel possible? and these chapters will blow your mind.Also great in this book are the Forward written by actor Eddie Redmayne, the Introduction written by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, and the Afterword written by daughter Lucy Hawking. Redmayne talked about spending months with Hawking prior to portraying him in the most excellent 2014 film The Theory of Everything and how he became a close friend to Stephen and his family. His family asked him to give a reading at Stephen's funeral. His portrayal of Stephen in the movie was incredible and lauded by Stephen, his family, and critics alike. Lucy Hawking's afterword is a poignant and touching tribute to her father and you will pause several times during these six pages as you will not be able to see through the water buildup over your corneas. She gives you an insight in to Stephen the father, his perseverance while battling ALS, and modesty regarding his fame. What a beautifully written chapter this is. Brief Answers to the Big Questions is the last message from one of the greatest minds of our time. It was moving to see his grave in Westminster Abbey between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin during my trip to London in August. He is missed."
357,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83077485-chelsea,5,"I love this book so so much!?! It made me feel that me (and my problems) are so so miniscule in the grand scale of things. The book covers the following questions in separate chapters: Is there a God? How did it all begin? Is there other intelligent life? Can we predict the future? What is inside a black hole? Is time travel possible? Will we survive on Earth? Should we colonize space? Will AI outsmart us? How do we shape the future? Hawking attempts to break down the ""answers"" into digestible nuggets of information, paired with analogies for the layman reader to swallow, and makes it so easy to read. Even so, I had to do lots of mental gymnastics to faintly grasp the concepts/ theories that he discusses in the first half of the book (more so than I have to do when I read the share sale agreement I'm working on now....), purely because these concepts/ theories are so counterintuitive to conventional ways of thinking (eg. that there are 11 dimensions and we can only experience 4, the concept of time only existed after the big bang). He does an amazing job nonetheless, and kudos to him for making physics palatable to the masses. The last quarter of the book sees him discussing humanity's future, making the case for space travel to salvage humanity, specifically that planets in other star systems may be viable options for human colonization (eg, Proxima b, an exoplanet that is closest to Earth but 4.5 lightyears away). He delves into the ethnical conundrum that we face in developing AI, and calls for regulated and cautious deployment and research into AI technology.My favourite quote from the book: “... we never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it. Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery, creating innovative and accessible ways to reach out to the widest young audience possible, greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever she may be.” *Aw*"
358,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87713068-parag-pawaiya,4,"""People want answers to the big questions, like why we are here. They don’t expect the answers to be easy, so they are prepared to struggle a bit. When people ask me if a God created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth—the Earth is a sphere that doesn’t have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise. Do I have faith? We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation: there is probably no heaven and afterlife either. I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think that when we die we return to dust. But there’s a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful."""
359,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21528136-fiona,3,"Stephen Hawking started work on this book but couldn’t finish it, so it was finalized after his death with already written texts.The way Hawking describes the universe and his view on life and the big questions is really likeable. He used simple words and daily-life-examples to explain complex processes and topics. That way it was easy to follow his arguments without having deeper knowledge of physics. In this book the tries to answer the big questions from his point of view. Questions regarding the existence of god, time travel, the end of the world etc. And he does a good job, always showing where it is about pure facts and where there is room for interpretations, so the reader can forge an opinion.Even though I was never into physics (mostly because I never understood a word) I will read some more from Hawking, because he explains things in a way even I know what he’s talking about."

361,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48431927-robert-yokoyama,5,"I bought this book because I admire Stephen Hawking and wanted to learn more about science. He asks questions in this book that I haven't thought of like what is in a black hole. There is no definitive answer to this question, but I did learn that a black hole is a collasped star that does have gravitational power to suck in a human being. I learned that a black hole does trap in light and emit a lot of heat and radiation. Hawking supported living in space, and he supports his belief by telling readers there are ice caps in the craters on the moon and volcanic activity on the planet Mars. This may be old news to most people, but this is new information for me. It gives hope that people will eventually live in space and build colonies there. I really like the chapter where Hawking questions whether or not God exists. He did not believe in God, but he does asks readers what question they would ask God if they believe in his existence. This is a question that got me thinking about what I would ask. There are written tributes in this book by his daughter Lucy, actor Eddie Redmayne that all show how revered Stephen Hawking is. I admire the optimism he had and enjoy this book very much."

363,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24820219-senthil-ganesh,4,"Wow. I feel I have become physically , intellectually & spiritually smaller after reading this book.An enlightening read on some of the biggest questions faced by the mankind, the book is true to its title and does its job fairly well in answering the complex questions in a simple easy-to-understand language ,for most parts.I must admit though, occasionally there were some theories that just went above my noob head.God- defined as an embodiment of laws of nature and not as a subject to human relationship is an interesting perspective.With nanocraft & superhumans in action,the future seems to be an exciting & scary time/place.Beside the main subject, the impact of the possibility of early death on Stephen Hawking's life is clearly told in the book."
364,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1120718-vonblubba,5,"I love big questions, and they don't get any bigger than the ones Hawking tries to answer in this book. We are talking about his personal opinions, of course, but it's definitely interesting to hear the opinions of one of the greatest minds of the last century.To be honest, on occasion some of the scientific theories presented seemed a little far-fetched to me, even if they were presented as ""this is how things work, that experiment proved it"". But again, exposition of those theories is necessarily oversimplified (maybe even a little bit too much), so that was to be expected.Everybody should spend some time mulling over these questions every now and then. This book is a great opportunity to do just that."

It also meandered quite a bit through Stephen Hawking's personal experience and the facts of the matter. Normally I would enjoy this discursive way of presenting answers to ""Big Questions,"" but I felt that a lot of the personal anecdotes were only there for fluff, while the scientific part of it was either glossed over or not given much thought at all."

This is not a very good book, to tell the truth, my truth that is. I certainly learned stuff from it, however, and liked it despite its problems, more or less, I guess that makes it good after all.For problems, I'll focus on two:- For one, the answers are not exactly brief. While this book, as far as I know, is directed to the general public, it does in depth more than needed. So while it is readable to the general public, that would make them less tempted to actually read it. I'd say that this book is directed to people with basic knowledge of physics, which is what allowed me to read it.- For two, the questions and their answers are not that fascinating. If you have knowledge of the ideas discussed, God's existence, Big Ban and time travel, do not expect something more than shedding new light on what you know already. Not that you cannot get more, I was certainly intrigued by the physics behind stuff I know from SciFi, and hearing it from no other than Stephen Hawking is different than Youtube.Speaking of Hawking, there are two main factors that make him who he is, to us readers of course. One is his fight with his condition, and two is his genius contribution to multiple fields, mainly cosmology and physics. He is, by all means, an extraordinary human being. One of the finest our race brought out. This book only vaguely touches those two points, however. This book could have been written by any of a large number of theoretical physicists with the same knowledge, at this level, and some of which would have been able to do it much better, make it shorter and briefer.That is my critique, but what do I know, better read and find out, chances are it won't be a waste of your time.*My interest in physics increases*"

Now, as we face immense challenges on our planet—including climate change, the threat of nuclear war, and the development of artificial intelligence—he turns his attention to the most urgent issues facing us.Will humanity survive? Should we colonize space? Does God exist? These are just a few of the questions Hawking addresses in this wide-ranging, passionately argued final book from one of the greatest minds in history.Featuring a foreword by Eddie Redmayne, who won an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking, an introduction by Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne, and an afterword from Hawking’s daughter, Lucy, Brief Answers to the Big Questions is a brilliant last message to the world.Eminently readable, Hawking again delivers a delightful look at how the steady state theory was blasted into space when the expanding universe was proven. Of course, this means that the big crunch is certainly in the future, whether humans are still around then, or not. Refreshing as always, Hawking is a firm fave in our stuga.

369,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922102-blaine,4,"Brief Answers to the Big Questions was published after Stephen Hawking’s death. It’s an interesting mix of speculation and explanation of the underlying science. The book also does a great job of explaining how Professor Hawking’s study of black holes shed so much light on our understanding of quantum mechanics and science generally. As a collection of various writings, there is some overlap, and it repeats itself a bit. But if you’re looking for me to write a takedown of a legendary scientist who I’ve admired for most of my life, you have come to the wrong place.It’s not  A Brief History of Time, but a good read, and a fine entry point if you’ve never read anything before by Professor Hawking. Recommended.And now, the even Briefer Answers to the Big Questions:1. Is there a God? No, because there was no time before the beginning of the universe in which a creator could have acted.2. How did it all begin? Scientists are still working on it.3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Possibly, but unlikely. If so, they are either far away or have overlooked us, because if they had visited, it would likely be like the film Independence Day.4. Can we predict the future? The uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics make it too difficult.5. What is inside a black hole? Still unclear, as theoretical physicists are trying to resolve the information paradox.6. Is time travel possible? Theoretically we could create such wormholes, but if we really could, wouldn’t someone from the future have come back to visit or maybe show us how?7. We will survive on earth? Barring future disaster (asteroid, runaway climate change), yes, but humanity and machines will evolve in unrecognizable ways.8. Should we colonize space? Yes, if only to prevent our extinction, but also to boost interest in science generally.9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? Yes, it will be able eventually to design itself, and its evolution is far faster than our biological evolution. So we better make sure its goals align with ours. 10. How do we shape the future? “If you know how something works, you can control it.” Improve education generally and science education specifically."
370,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1778796-merry,5,"Where to begin? Especially when you’re reviewing a book by Stephen Hawking. Amazing, that’s a good start. Written in an incredibly down-to-earth manner (what s surprise considering how brilliant he was!), I have to admit there were moments I was still overwhelmed. It reminded me of some of those shows on tv about the universe where the absolute enormity of what they’re discussing becomes too much to comprehend even though it’s geared for “regular people.” And his delightful sense of humor! Every once in a while it would shine through as in this paragraph:“How do we start this journey? So far, our explorations have been limited to our local cosmic neighbourhood. Forty years on, our most intrepid explorer, Voyager, has just made it to interstellar space. Its speed, eleven miles a second, means it would take about 70,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri. This constellation is 4.37 light years away, twenty-five trillion miles. If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump.”Additionally he was quite a family man as he relates little snippets throughout the book and as evidenced by the touching words from his daughter at the end. All in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I close with his final thoughts:“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”"

I liked how the author views the world and you can plainly see how much he really enjoyed life and everything in it. I want to read more of Hawking's writing now."

Here Hawking summarises his life's work by dealing with 8 Big Questions he contemplated in the past 50 years. His explanations are clear and rather forcefully presented. However, I don't think his reflections on the first 2 questions about the existence of God and how the world began will satisfy many believers. He essentially says that there was no need for God in order for the universe to be created and sustained. He doesn't belittle believers, but says that God is ""beside the point.""But no matter what your belief system is, this is a science book well worth reading-especially in the current American atmosphere where some of our political leaders think that science itself is ""beside the point."""

Wehave finally found something that doesn’t have a cause,because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me thismeans that there is no possibility of a creator, because there isno time for a creator to have existed in.  From the chapter Will We Survive On Earth At the same time, many of those same politicians are denyingthe reality of man-made climate change, or at least the abilityof man to reverse it, just at the moment that our world isfacing a series of critical environmental crises. The danger isthat global warming may become self-sustaining, if it has notbecome so already.  From the chapter How Do We Shape the Future With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relationto immigration and the development of education, we arewitnessing a global revolt against experts, which includesscientists. So what can we do to secure the future of scienceand technology education?  Also from the chapter How Do We Shape the FutureAnd I believe the future of learning and education is theinternet. People can answer back and interact. In a way, theinternet connects us all together like the neurons in a giantbrain. And with such an IQ, what cannot we be capable of?  From the afterword by Lucy HawkingI thought it was perfectly normal to ask grown-ups lots ofchallenging questions because this is what we did at home. Itwas only when I allegedly reduced a vicar to tears with myclose examination of his proof of the existence of God that itstarted to dawn on me that this was unexpected.  I’d love to read a book from Lucy’s POV and see what growing up with her Dad was like, how it affected her life."

She bought it (she doesn't usually read) and said it was interesting, so I picked it up! And she was right! While I feel like I had my own opinions about many of the topics talked about by Hawking in this book, the way he talked about it blew my mind. This book is and isn't opinion based. Hawkings, as you'd expect, has his opinions grounded in science. From reading this book its my personal opinion that he doesn't at all suffer from confirmation-bias. That is, instead of finding facts to back up his opinions, he uses the science he has learned to form his opinions. He also states that one of his great loves in his life is explaining and presenting difficult to understand theories and knowledge in a way that is easy for the average person to interperate, and this book sums up this love perfectly. While this book still is filled with difficult to understand scientific concepts, Hawking uses analogies and simple language to present these concepts in a way I could easily understand. Not only could I understand them, but I could also ponder them and further think on them. Hawking has a really unique and intelligent perspective on some of the big questions. While I wasn't super interested in learning what is inside a black hole, I was blown away by the way he explains and discusses the topics of religion, aliens, time travel, how the universe began, etc. Thesse topics interest me so much. And Im so thankful that Hawking took his time to share his opinions on these topics before his passing. His mind was brilliant, and its truly a gift to get a peek into how he see's the world, and to understand why he sees it that way. I really liked this book, so I'm giving it a solid four star rating.🌟🌟🌟🌟"
379,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking“Brief Answers to the Big Questions” addresses the big questions of the day by scientists, political leaders and the general public. World-famous cosmologist and award-winning author Stephen Hawking takes the readers on his final ride to answering some of the most interesting questions facing humankind. This instructive 227-page book includes the following ten chapters: Chapter 1: Is There a God? Chapter 2: How Did It All Begin? Chapter 3: Is There Other Intelligent Life in the Universe? Chapter 4: Can We Predict the Future? Chapter 5: What Is Inside a Black Hole? Chapter 6: Is Time Travel Possible? Chapter 7: Will We Survive on Earth? Chapter 8: Should We Colonise Space? Chapter 9: Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us? Chapter 10: How Do We Shape the Future?Positives:1.	Professionally written, accessible, brief and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of the big questions facing humankind from the masterful mind of Stephen Hawking.3.	The book is a compilation of Hawking’s answers to ten big questions. The book follows a clean pattern of asking the big question (one per chapter), discussion and summary. 4.	 Kip Thorne provides a warm introduction that captures the essence of Hawking. “This “Hawking temperature” of a black hole and its “Hawking radiation” (as they came to be called) were truly radical—perhaps the most radical theoretical physics discovery in the second half of the twentieth century. They opened our eyes to profound connections between general relativity (black holes), thermodynamics (the physics of heat) and quantum physics (the creation of particles where before there were none).”5.	There is a sense of awe that drives Hawking’s curiosity. “When we see the Earth from space, we see ourselves as a whole. We see the unity, and not the divisions. It is such a simple image with a compelling message; one planet, one human race.”6.	A look back at his illness, words of wisdom. “After my expectations had been reduced to zero, every new day became a bonus, and I began to appreciate everything I did have. While there’s life, there is hope.”7.	So is there a God? Spoiler alert. “One could define God as the embodiment of the laws of nature. However, this is not what most people would think of as God. They mean a human-like being, with whom one can have a personal relationship. When you look at the vast size of the universe, and how insignificant and accidental human life is in it, that seems most implausible.”8.	Complex topics made accessible. “You can’t get to a time before the Big Bang because there was no time before the Big Bang. We have finally found something that doesn’t have a cause, because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means that there is no possibility of a creator, because there is no time for a creator to have existed in.”9.	Key concepts defined. “Anthropic Principle, the idea that our theories about the universe must be compatible with our own existence.”10.	Provocative observations. “We are used to thinking of intelligent life as an inevitable consequence of evolution, but what if it isn’t? The Anthropic Principle should warn us to be wary of such arguments. It is more likely that evolution is a random process, with intelligence as only one of a large number of possible outcomes.”11.	The difficulty in predicting the future. “In practice, however, our ability to predict the future is severely limited by the complexity of the equations, and the fact that they often have a property called chaos.”12.	A discussion on the black hole. “The black holes are still characterised only by their overall mass, electric charge and spin outside the event horizon but the event horizon itself contains the information needed to tell us about what has fallen into the black hole in a way that goes beyond these three characteristics the black hole has. People are still working on these issues and therefore the information paradox remains unresolved. But I am optimistic that we are moving towards a solution. Watch this space.”13.	The uncertainty principle plays a prominent role in this book. “The reason quantum theory can allow the energy density to be negative is that it is based on the Uncertainty Principle. This says that certain quantities like the position and speed of a particle can’t both have well-defined values.”14.	Is time travel possible? Spoiler alert. “In conclusion, rapid space travel and travel back in time can’t be ruled out according to our present understanding. They would cause great logical problems, so let’s hope there’s a Chronology Protection Law to prevent people going back and killing their parents. But science-fiction fans need not lose heart. There’s hope in M-theory.”15.	Interesting observations on the biggest threats to humanity. “First, the Earth is becoming too small for us. Our physical resources are being drained at an alarming rate. We have presented our planet with the disastrous gift of climate change. Rising temperatures, reduction of the polar ice caps, deforestation, over-population, disease, war, famine, lack of water and decimation of animal species; these are all solvable but so far have not been solved.”16.	The need to colonize space. “I was quoted at the time as saying that I feared the human race is not going to have a future if we don’t go into space. I believed it then, and I believe it still.”17.	A fascinating look at artificial intelligence. “In short, the advent of super-intelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. The real risk with AI isn’t malice but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours we’re in trouble.”18.	The future of humanity. “We have two options for the future of humanity as I see it: first, the exploration of space for alternative planets on which to live, and second, the positive use of artificial intelligence to improve our world.”Negatives:1.	No supplementary materials.2.	No links to supporting information.3.	Meant for the masses so lacks depth.4.	Not at the same level as some of his previous books and that’s ok. In summary, this is a fun and instructive book to read. Hawking provides his succinct answers to the big questions facing humankind. The key to this book is that it was written for the masses, Hawking intends to educate and inspire. If you are looking for a book to whet your appetite, this is it. I recommend it.

380,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23360457-mihai-leonte,2,"The author's enthusiasm for knowledge and science is contagious. However I think the book is targeted towards a younger audience which might explain the lack of more thorough insights into the topics he selected. More disappointing for me was the choice of some of these topics - some of them are covered very superficially and sometimes even with a surprising one-sidedness. As I recently finished Factfulness by Hans Rosling - where he explains how the population increase is slowing down and experts having good reason to believe that it will again plateau in the future - I was stunned to hear Hawking exaggerate this danger over and over again. And unfortunately this was not the only topic on which he is not an expert and yet gives his opinion and presents it as fact. He covers religion, AI, social politics with a very broad brush and a very self assured tone: ""Time didn't exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in."" Hawking's concept of God as being part of creation is different to the definition most people/religions have, so his argument feels incomplete. The editing is poor and makes the book feel rushed - which it might have been the case. Maybe they tried to capitalize on a great man's passing by having a new book quickly available. I'm being cynical, but I can't find a better reason why there are so many paragraphs being repeated in different chapters."

Is there a God?Our ancestors wanted a reason to believe in the creation. Religion, scriptures and stories were the tool for them to believe in and it actually comforted them. Unlike religion or god, Science provide you the understanding of the universe with a rational framework.Law of nature cannot be broken. For creation all you needed was matter, Energy and space. Where they come from? - from Big Bang. You can actually get a whole universe for free, an ultimate free lunch, so a creator was not needed. (Negative energy is an interesting topic to look into, because space itself is a vast store of negative energy and it involves in time travel, wormholes etc.)Nothing caused Big bang. There was no time before big bang, so the creator. Time didn’t exist before the big bang so there is no time for god to make the universe.How did it all begin?Ireland Archbishop Ussher’s claim on beginning of time was on 22 October 4004 BC at 6pm. But now it’s been discovered that the Universe is 13.8 billion years old and earth is 4.5 billion years old, proved by Cosmic microwave background and Rock radiometric dating respectively.Edwin Hubble discovered that universe is expanding by looking at the faint patches of light as they are far away. As galaxies are moving away, the light from them would take billion year to reach us. S, going in reverse of Big bang Theory, the universe must have begun from an extremely dense and high-energy ball (a singularity) which inflated, and galaxies and stars are formed. Hawking claims that in order to understand the origin of the universe, one has to incorporate the uncertainty principle and general theory of relativity which is still a great challenge in theoretical physics.According to Stephen-hawking-Hartle state (No Boundary proposal), what came before Big bang is meaningless, there was no time and there was nothing. And everything became a concept right after the Big bang. During inflation, some regions of the universe had higher density than others which led to the formation of galaxies and stars due to the gravitation attraction and slow expansion. Is there other intelligent life in universe?Our Universe entropy increase with time, means, the disorder increases as universe is still expanding. The same chaos happened in the name of random mutation and it took millions of years (Genes mutation, Brain development etc..) for the evolution of human with intelligence. It evolved from our mammal ancestors who survived the impact of the asteroid which wiped our dinosaur species some 60 million years ago and we are here because they survived. Self-reproducing systems like cells or microorganisms may be alive in any corner of any of the planets. But the possibility of intelligent life is very low as random process is more likely to happen, but evolution of intelligence is a very rare outcome of it.  Can we predict the future?Einstein objected the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics, especially Uncertainty principle which defined you cannot measure both position and speed of a particle simultaneously. Einstein believed in determinism and proposed Hidden Variable theory explains that object is directly influenced by its immediate surroundings. He said, ‘God doesn’t play dice’. But John Bell’s experiment and result were inconsistent with Hidden variable theory and it was disproved.Erwin Schrodinger introduced wave function and it represents both position and speed of a particle. The size of wave function gives the probability of particle will be found at that position. The variation rate of wave function gives the speed of the particle. Wave function is strongly peaked in a small region and both position and speed can be determined by Schrodinger equation. So, it’s still possible to predict. What is inside black hole?Well we don’t know yet. A star weights millions of times of mass of the sun when its gravity wins over nuclear thermal pressure, star compresses having unbelievable density and then it explodes and so the black hole is formed. Black hole is a region of space time which has enormous amount of gravity nothing would escape. Einstein equation cannot be defined at the point of singularity with infinite density.Roger Penrose proposed cosmic censorship conjecture tells that all singularities are hidden from view inside the black hole, we cannot observe from the rest of space time. But Black hole emits particle and radiation. All you can know is black hole’s mass, electric charge and spin. So sorry! we don’t know what is inside the black hole for now.  Is time travel possible?Time travel to the past is not possible. to future? Yes. If you travel at speed of light (299 792 458 m/s). Casimir effect shows that virtual particles pop into existence and energy density is negative. Quantum theory allows the energy density to be negative, providing it is positive in other and field can’t be exactly zero as it violates Uncertainty principle (Position and speed of a particle cannot be measured at the same time). So, combining both theory of relativity (bending of light, curved space time) and Quantum theory & Casimir effect (space time wrap in negative direction), we can travel to past by constructing wormhole.But Stephen Hawking proposed a hypothesis called “Chronology Protection Conjecture” proposes that the law of physics conspire to prevent time travel on a macroscopic scale.But M theory offers the 11 dimensions concept, where 7 dimensions are curled up into a space so small that we can’t even notice them. But M theory is our best hope to tie General Relativity with Quantum theory. In future, it may give rise to many things we don’t know yet and it may open unbelievable possibilities.Will we survive on earth?Definitely NO. Asteroid Collision, Nuclear War, Over Population, Deforestation, Famine, Animal Species Extinction, Climate Change, Artificial Intelligence, Pandemic Disease and list goes on. Sooner or later, Nature will throw a combined of any of above to sweep out the human race, if we don’t alert ourselves to stop doing the unnecessary risks we are into. Stephen hawking is more convinced that “humans need to leave the earth. If we stay, we risk being annihilated”. Should we colonize space?‘Not to leave planet earth would be like castaway on a desert island not trying to escape”.We should Colonize. Base on Moon by 2050, Manned Landing on Mars by 2070 (No worries! We have Elon Musk to take care of it). We are not going to have future, if we don’t go into space.Come on Guys! Moon & Mars are our Jackpot. And in future (say in 300-500 years), we may have interstellar travel (Fuel energy from Nuclear fusion or matter-antimatter annihilation) crossing across different space to find planets with Goldilocks zone (water and supportive atmosphere) and solar system like ours. We will.Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?People asked a computer, ‘Is there a god?’And the computer said, ‘There is now’, and fused the plug.Civilization is the product of human intelligence and so Artificial Intelligence. Even computer has its own set of evolution, but it had set by human brain. Considering the growth of Technology, dismissing or taking AI for granted will be a potential mistake. AI will surpass human and it will not be a surprising news that AI would take off on its own and redesign itself at a rate which couldn’t even compare to human slow biological evolution. British Mathematician Irving Good hypothesis ‘technological singularity’ would come true one day that a powerful super intelligence will surpass human intelligence, results in human extinction, unless we have a Kill Switch.  How do we space the future?Indisputably, Science is the answer for the all queries in the past, the present and the future. It is the part of our daily lives. Future lies in the hand of schools and inspiring teachers giving a better education and providing the scientific temper. We must engage fully with the study of science at an early level so can give our potential. Let’s be scientifically literate and inspire the young generation to create a better world for the whole human race."

If you are going to buy this book, buy the Barnes & Noble Exclusive Edition as it includes the bonus content of five tributes from notable friends of Stephen. In Brief Answers to the Big Questions Stephen answers ten of humankind's most pressing questions succinctly with a combination of incredible scientific insight and humor. His arguments are presented in easy-to-digest twenty-or-so page chapters. Stephen is writing for the layperson so most of this book is accessible to the average science enthusiast, although some of the subjects required more of a deep dive and my head was sent spinning like it did while reading his  A Brief History of Time. Some of my favorite chapters were: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?, and Will we survive on Earth?. While Stephen isn't an expert in all of the ten subjects he writes about in this book, he has a unique insight and presents interesting rationalizations for each. He also writes about his expertise in What is inside a black hole?, and Is time travel possible? and these chapters will blow your mind.Also great in this book are the Forward written by actor Eddie Redmayne, the Introduction written by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, and the Afterword written by daughter Lucy Hawking. Redmayne talked about spending months with Hawking prior to portraying him in the most excellent 2014 film The Theory of Everything and how he became a close friend to Stephen and his family. His family asked him to give a reading at Stephen's funeral. His portrayal of Stephen in the movie was incredible and lauded by Stephen, his family, and critics alike. Lucy Hawking's afterword is a poignant and touching tribute to her father and you will pause several times during these six pages as you will not be able to see through the water buildup over your corneas. She gives you an insight in to Stephen the father, his perseverance while battling ALS, and modesty regarding his fame. What a beautifully written chapter this is. Brief Answers to the Big Questions is the last message from one of the greatest minds of our time. It was moving to see his grave in Westminster Abbey between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin during my trip to London in August. He is missed."

The book covers the following questions in separate chapters: Is there a God? How did it all begin? Is there other intelligent life? Can we predict the future? What is inside a black hole? Is time travel possible? Will we survive on Earth? Should we colonize space? Will AI outsmart us? How do we shape the future? Hawking attempts to break down the ""answers"" into digestible nuggets of information, paired with analogies for the layman reader to swallow, and makes it so easy to read. Even so, I had to do lots of mental gymnastics to faintly grasp the concepts/ theories that he discusses in the first half of the book (more so than I have to do when I read the share sale agreement I'm working on now....), purely because these concepts/ theories are so counterintuitive to conventional ways of thinking (eg. that there are 11 dimensions and we can only experience 4, the concept of time only existed after the big bang). He does an amazing job nonetheless, and kudos to him for making physics palatable to the masses. The last quarter of the book sees him discussing humanity's future, making the case for space travel to salvage humanity, specifically that planets in other star systems may be viable options for human colonization (eg, Proxima b, an exoplanet that is closest to Earth but 4.5 lightyears away). He delves into the ethnical conundrum that we face in developing AI, and calls for regulated and cautious deployment and research into AI technology.My favourite quote from the book: “... we never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it. Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery, creating innovative and accessible ways to reach out to the widest young audience possible, greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever she may be.” *Aw*"
388,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87713068-parag-pawaiya,4,"""People want answers to the big questions, like why we are here. They don’t expect the answers to be easy, so they are prepared to struggle a bit. When people ask me if a God created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth—the Earth is a sphere that doesn’t have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise. Do I have faith? We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation: there is probably no heaven and afterlife either. I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think that when we die we return to dust. But there’s a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful."""
389,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21528136-fiona,3,"Stephen Hawking started work on this book but couldn’t finish it, so it was finalized after his death with already written texts.The way Hawking describes the universe and his view on life and the big questions is really likeable. He used simple words and daily-life-examples to explain complex processes and topics. That way it was easy to follow his arguments without having deeper knowledge of physics. In this book the tries to answer the big questions from his point of view. Questions regarding the existence of god, time travel, the end of the world etc. And he does a good job, always showing where it is about pure facts and where there is room for interpretations, so the reader can forge an opinion.Even though I was never into physics (mostly because I never understood a word) I will read some more from Hawking, because he explains things in a way even I know what he’s talking about."
