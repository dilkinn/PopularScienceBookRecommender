1,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"I should explain the point about the watchmaker. A SMALL ROCKIf you’re walking along in the countryside and you come across a rock, you don’t say, well, where the hell did that come from and who made it? It’s a rock. No one cares. There’s no notices stuck on trees or printed in local free newspapers anywhere saying “have you seen this rock? Description – roughly three inches by four by three; last seen in the Dorchester area; undistinctive grey colouring; answers to the name of “rock”; reward – please call this number; WE MISS YOU ROCK” . It’s a rock. ON THE OTHER HAND, A GOLD WATCHNow, if you saw a beautiful gold watch on your walk in the countryside, you would say – lo! a watch – I deduce that someone has lost a watch and it is here; also, I furthermore deduce that there must be a God.” Richard Dawkins says that watches, or indeed anything complicated, do not infer the existence of a watchmaker. Or, to use a different analogy, a book, which can be a complicated thing, does not infer the existence of an author. You could say well, here’s a book called The Blind Watchmaker and it says it’s by Richard Dawkins, so we see that Richard Dawkins is the author and he wrote this book, but Richard Dawkins would say NO! it doesn’t, have you not been paying attention, have you been giggling and passing notes in the back row again? EVOLUTION OF THE SEMICOLONWhat happened is that gradually, over many billions of years, language formed, inconceivably slowly, for instance it took ten million years for commas to evolve out of a full stop, and another ten million for the exotic semi-colon to evolve out of the comma. So this book The Blind Watchmaker (like all other books) evolved slowly. We have fossils to prove this. They show the missing links. We have, for instance, copies of the book which are called The Blond Watchmaker dating from the Devonian period – it took several millions of years for the Blond to evolve into the Blind, you see. I read that Mexican paleontologists recently unearthed a copy called The Bland Watchmaker. Going back further , we find all sorts of evolutionary byways that, because of natural selection, died out eventually. One manuscript from the late Pleistocene period which is currently on display at the University of East Anglia shows a strange hybrid between an early version of The Blind Watchmaker and Alice in Wonderland in which the famous teaparty scene features a pterodactyl, a plesiosaur (so very unlikely) and a crazed archaeopteryx. This unviable literary form did not survive, as we know. Natural selection, although brutal from our limited human perspective, explains the evolution of complex things. RELIGION CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY TWILIGHT IS POPULARGod cannot explain why the book species “Stephanie Myers” and “Dan Brown”, for instance, proliferate wildly in many varied habitats, whilst arguably more beautiful forms like Henry James, Proust, and the Golden Tamarin dwindle to the point where human intervention from libraries and literary professors are the only thing keeping them from sinking into oblivion – no, God cannot explain this. But Richard Dawkins (also known as ""Science"") can.Sorry, that should be “Richard Dawkins”."
2,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dawkins loves explaining evolutionary theory, and this is one of his best books. My favourite bit is the section on long-tailed birds (peacocks, etc). From the point of view of simple utility, they are rather baffling. What use could you possibly have for that long, stupid tail?But, as Dawkins keeps reminding us, it's not about survival of the species, or even of the individual, but rather of the gene. Suppose there's a sex-linked male gene that disposes towards long tails, and a sex-linked female gene that disposes towards finding long tails attractive. A child born of a union between two individuals carrying these genes will be likely to have both of them. Hence, if it's male, it'll have a long tail, and if it's female it will prefer males with long tails. If this combination becomes common, long-tailed males will have a larger and larger advantage in terms of being preferred by females. Tails will lengthen until the practical downside (being unable to fly, avoid predators, etc) counterbalances the upside of efficiently attracting potential mates.I read this, and suddenly looked at supermodels in a new light. God, they're hot! In fact, if they were any hotter they'd be dead. "
3,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"As the title's extension spells out, this is a definitive (as of '87) rebuttal against all comers in favor of Darwinism, but don't let my saying so prove it. Read it for yourself.All his arguments are crystal clear, but he takes extra time to caricature the caricature of Darwinists, pointing out exactly how the ad absurdum argument really works while also elucidating the fine points of what Darwinism IS versus what it is NOT.He steps us through the first third of the book showing us how Selection works: from an energy standpoint, a competition standpoint, and a sexual standpoint... from the basic building blocks of proteins to more and more complex forms of DNA and the combo cells that collect all the wonderful multicellular creations, including bacteria, that eventually wind up creating us. The descriptions are quite beautiful and clear and all the while, we've got all the foundations for life... without Intelligent Design. The argument is simple, of course. If we can explain everything, and I mean everything that is life and physics, then what purpose does adding a superfluous layer to the explanation serve?This is ten years worth of hate mail for the author, people. He has been beset on all sides with genuinely curious and well-meaning seekers of the god-fearing sort and inundated with screaming lunatics telling him he'll burn in hell for his first book, The Selfish Gene, which, by the way, didn't really give a rat's ass about creationism or the people who support it. It just laid out a very cogent theory that fit all the copious mountains of data in biology. And yet, after that point, a Mr. Dawkins who professes not to want or need a PR team or lawyers, decides to put his foot down and tackle the problem that has reared its muti-angled head in his direction and DEFEND Darwinism.He does so beautifully, I might add. Every step of the way, he defines the complaints with due diligence and proceeds to demolish them sonar-producing batlike grace, with light humor, sharp intellect, and sometimes he makes of his opponents an overzealous meal. Can you blame him? Granted, by this point it's only been a decade of Creationist hate. Give it a decade or a decade and a half more before we see a truly flame worthy attack from Mr.Dawkins. I'm looking forward to seeing some of it in his books. I hope it's there and not just in his interviews which I still haven't seen. Alas.Seriously, though, this book is pretty wonderful for its lucid and quoteworthy passages and vivid descriptions of how Darwinism works, from gene level to the kinds of time-spans that can only be described as geological when it comes to real changes in evolution. I particularly loved the fact that he used computer terminology to describe how our genes are nothing more than complex computers. I've heard this before, of course, but the way he laid it out was particularly enlightening.This stuff is pretty damn great. Just from the science viewpoint, even leaving out the whole defense, it's well worth reading and not nearly as acerbic or rabid as certain other mass-produced troll-attacks make him appear. But then again, I've only read one of his later books, the The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, which was just a charming bi-modal description of science versus magical thinking which also happened to ""gently"" draw people away from having to add that extra layer of explanation to reality. :) I guess I'll see what the other books bring, no?"
4,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,2,"It is a good thing that Dawkins himself takes the trouble to think about which chapters of his books will be of vanishing interest in the near future. Of course, he turned out to be more accurate than he must have wished for. This must be the most boring of all Dawkins’ books, but I do not want to give up on him till I read ‘The Extended Phenotype’ which just might prove to be the best (scientifically) of all his works. With whole chapters devoted to the driest taxonomy problems and to disproving outdated theories, the book was a massive waste of time once I went past the mildly interesting first half. But, it still provides an opportunity to use Dawkins’ own method of caricature-based argument to paint a caricature of his own positions in ‘The God Delusion’ based on his own vitriolic stands in this book. I will try to examine in detail how Dawkins has betrayed his own principles of scientific grounding and rational rigorousness in The God Delusion by using arguments and structures from this book in the review. Hopefully that will happen by tomorrow..."
5,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"A rather well-written book. I like the writing style of Pr. Dawkins. It was not as challenging as ""Selfish gene"". But I guess its complexity is pretty relevant to the level of articulation many have. However, it was a great read and made me think more about the topic. "
6,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1402463-mostephl,5,"wow and double wow. i read this through and turned back to p.1 to read it again. blind watchmaker has been amazingly influential in the way i think about just about everything- the world, existence, life forms, physics- down to the micro, myself and my craft. it's sent chills down my spine, made me euphoric and angry. the first for finally addressing questions that have long been in my mind (but receive no echo in society as i've known it), the second for the willful repression of information and large-scale institutionalized dumb-down that is the public school system i grew up in. it makes me want to cry to think that i didn't learn about evolution until i already had a master's degree. i am learning now, though, largely through dawkins, stephen j. gould and others who've been able to bring the complexities of this subject to the laypeople. still angry that whatever my daughter learns about evolution, she'll have to learn from me, a social scientist and by no means an authority. nonetheless, in a college classroom if her professor asks if anyone's heard of darwin, her answer will be a resounding, ""yeah!!"". small victory, but something.p.s. there's a great, great BBC documentary on Galapagos- highly worth checking out. "
7,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34331-laura,2,"This book was okay, but since I already am convinced evolution occurs by natural selection, I felt like he was not preaching to the choir, but trying to convince the choir. Of course, I got tired of it after a while (but I had to keep going, because I had to read it for a class). He comes up with many different arguments/theories for how evolution/natural selection could occur, many of which are interesting, but I would just rather read a science book rather than a philosophical book on evolution. For instance, I recommend The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner, which shows how scientists study evolution and natural selection in action. "
8,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Two summers ago, I did myself the favor of reading The Selfish Gene. Well, I didn’t quite read it; rather, I listened to Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, narrate the book, as I took long walks in the forest near my house. Incidentally, I think Dawkins (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lalla) has a magnificent voice; it’s a pleasure to hear him speak.  But that’s a matter of taste; what is not a matter of taste is the quality of that book. Agree or disagree with Dawkins, one must admit that The Selfish Gene is a book of the finest quality. Indeed, I must say that I wasn’t quite prepared for how good it was. I was expecting an entertaining book of popular science; what I got was an eloquent, subtle, and powerful book which managed, in a just a couple weeks of long walks, to completely transform my understanding of animal behavior. This book, The Blind Watchmaker—also listened to in a few long walks—is not of the same caliber. But it is quite good. (Well, if it were written by almost anybody except Dawkins himself, I would say it was very good—but I know the heights he can reach.) I know close to nothing about his advocacy of atheism, and frankly I don’t much care, but I think the public has a rare treasure in Dawkins; what other popular biology writer can compare? Dawkins is, to an almost remarkable extent, as much a philosopher as a scientist. This book, as well as his first, is jammed full of thought experiments; Dawkins simply can’t get enough of them. This emphasis on philosophical argumentation allows him, so to speak, to take the reader inside the logic of Darwinism (as well as inside the fuzzy logic of Darwinism’s opponents). He doesn’t simply tell the reader things biologists think—like a reporter sending dispatches from the front lines—but tries to get the layreader to understand exactly why biologists think what they do. As a result, his books can actually be a bit dense and exhausting; but the patient reader is amply rewarded with a deepened understanding. The main reason that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as his first was that Dawkins spends an awful lot of time dealing with contemporary controversies. This was, I believe, a time of the famed ‘Darwin Wars’, when Gould and his followers had highly publicized debates with team Dawkins. Apparently, reporters were very eager to report anything even slightly critical of Darwinian theory—whether it be from taxonomists, paleontologists, or priests—so Dawkins was forced to spend a lot of time on material that, to today’s reader, may be of limited interest. For example, Dawkins becomes almost pedantic in his chapter on punctuated equilibrium, as he argues again and again that Gould is not a ‘true’ saltationist, but only a modified gradualist. Having read Gould, I was personally interested in this; but I would understand if others were not. Perhaps I was not the book’s target audience, as I needed no convincing that Darwinian evolution is both a well-supported and a powerful theory. Nonetheless, Dawkins did manage to clear up some of evolution’s finer point for me. I was particularly excited when (not to take too much credit) Dawkins confirmed a suspicion that I had expressed a few years back, when I was learning about human evolution. I was actually in Kenya, studying with the Leakeys, who—being the Leakeys—had plastic casts of several dozen important hominin fossils in their lab. As my anatomy teacher enjoyed pointing out, the vast majority of hominin fossils for any given species can fit inside a shoebox. Most of the fossils are distorted, broken, or otherwise fragmentary. Yet from these scant remains, paleoanthropologists expend tremendous energy arguing about the hominin family tree. Is this skull cap Homo erectus or Homo habilis? Is this thigh bone from an early homo or a late autralopithecus? Somewhat exasperated by all this ambiguity—about what appeared to me to be a matter of words—I got an idea: what if the idea of ‘species’ itself breaks down in an evolutionary timescale? After all, if we believe that species change via gradual selection one to another, it follows that there must be individuals intermediate between any two given hominin species, and, furthermore, individuals intermediate between the intermediates—and so on. Eureka! Well, it turns out Dawkins (as well as many other, probably) had the very same idea long before; it appears that convergent evolution is even more prevalent among memes than genes. (As a side note, if one believes, like Gould, in punctuated equilibrium, then ‘species’ would still be valid in an evolutionary timescale. Perhaps this is why the paleoanthropologists are still arguing?) I got sidetracked—back to the book. (Speaking of sidetracked, Dawkins is the master of the interesting aside and the lengthy digression; and, even more impressively, he always manages to tie his asides and digressions neatly back into the main theme under discussion.) Well, I’m afraid I don’t have very much more to say, other than this: if you find yourself with a supply of long walks, and need an audiobook as accompaniment, you might as well download Dawkins’s crisp, dry, whispery voice, and deepen your understanding of the flora and fauna around you—whether it be this book or, if you want a real treat, his first."
9,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd,5,"Dawkins is one of my top picks for the most articulate, engaging and proficient scientists I've read to date. The Blind Watchmaker turned out to be a very prolific piece. I was baffled by his logical analogies, most excellent examples and extremely engaging vernacular. In this work, one learns much about the evolutionary adaptations of numerous species, of which the sonar technology of baths, dolphins and other mammals seemed most shocking.His reasoning of what constitutes miracles, probability theory and reasoning behind the drawback of the Lamark's theory of acquired characteristics is exceptionally enticing. The book should be a required high-school reading. A very, very high recommendation."
10,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7503511-seth-hanson,4,"At the time, this was a tough book for me to read. Considering the way I was raised - in a heavily religious atmosphere - it was hard for me to accept the theory of evolution. However, Dawkins very clearly lays out the theory in a way that anyone can understand if they are willing to open their mind just a little and put in just a little effort. It might be hard to accept but its even harder to dispute. Reality is like that. I think everyone should be required to read this book. "
11,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins’ outstanding The Selfish Gene, my initial impression of The Blind Watchmaker was a bit of a letdown. Dawkins wrote the book to counter creationist thinking, but for a firm believer in Darwinian evolution, his lengthy arguments were unnecessary. However, if Dawkins converted any creationists, I would consider the book a great success. With that said, there were a number of things I did like. Below are some items that caught my attention.Darwin’s concept of gradual evolution overturned the ideas of the catastrophists, who believed the earth and its creatures were formed by sudden drastic changes. Gradual evolution was then challenged by saltationists who believed large genetic changes or macro-mutations could explain much of evolution. A more refined view is that of Stephen Jay Gould who posited punctuated equilibrium. This view recognized varying rates of change, periods of relative stasis with intervals of rapid modification. Keep in mind rapid was on a geologic time scale where 50,000 years is a short time. Thus Gould’s rapid change could still have evolved step-by-step in line with Darwin. The effect of gradualism that struck me was the notion that speciation is contingent on the demise of intermediate individuals. Otherwise one could not tell where one species began and another ended.An upshot of Dawkins’ idea concerns our own connection with our ancestors. The view of chimpanzees as property is made more acceptable because there are no living intermediaries that show our close relationship. This made me wonder how Neanderthals would be treated if some were found alive. Would they be treated like chimpanzees as a different species? Since they are beings who can successfully interbreed with Homo sapiens, would they be given the same rights? Would Christians consider them as individuals with souls that should be saved? I enjoyed Dawkins explanation of the development of the eye in support of gradualism. The book’s title comes from a pre-Darwin argument that if one found a watch, one would have to assume someone made it. The watch is too intricate to have formed naturally. Post-Darwin, like the watch, some held that the eye was so complex as to defy gradual evolution. Dawkins counters. He takes us from a cell with a light sensitive spot to a creature with several such cells that is helped by this sense of light or dark. Then if the light sensitive cells are recessed, the creature can tell the direction of the shadow. If the recess takes on a cuplike shape, this sense of the light’s direction is enhanced. Next if the walls of the cup build up and protrude partially over the cup, a pinhole camera is formed casting an image on the cup. Then, protecting the cup by extending a membrane over the pinhole forms a lens. And so on…I enjoyed the section on bats and echolocation. Dawkins also offers a reasonable explanation of how this seemingly amazing ability could develop. Dolphins, whales and some birds have independently developed this use of sound showing such development not to be quite as extraordinary as one might think. Dawkins pondering of how bats experience this sense I found fascinating. Do the nerve impulses get mapped by the brain to a model similar to the one we experience as vision? And then there is the fish that senses its environment from disruption to an electrical field – elctrolocation. How is this sense perceived? Another intriguing topic was how sexual selection augments natural selection. Unlike environmental factors which wax and wane in intensity, sexual selection forms a positive feedback loop. A female bird’s preference for long tails in her mate not only promotes the gene for long tails but the gene for the desire for long tails. As both genes proliferate tails will grow longer until a practical limit is reached. The bird still has to be an able flyer to survive. One’s mind quickly turns to how this idea works in humans.This book will mean different things to different readers. Every creationist should read it although I suspect few will. For the rest of us, the book is still worthwhile just to get Dawkins’ unique views on odd and end topics, a few of which I covered. If you get bored reading why creationism is wrong, keep in mind the book is written to be easily read, so you can get through those sections quickly."
12,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"This book is a more nail in the coffin of creationism.It develops the darvinian theory of evolution,change and selection,but at a more deep level than the original Darwins theory,the deeper level of molecular biology and molecular genetics,subjects this unknown in the Darwins time as the quantum electrodinamics was unknown in the Maxwells time but explains at a deeper level the electromagnetic fenomenology.The first chapters explains the incredible aparition of wonderful organs as the human eye as a long series of very small changes and steps as consecuence of mutations by chance each step selected between many others possibles by efficacy and supervivence along unimaginable for the human mind long period of time,millions of years,as the human mind is unable of make a idea of what a light year is in distance.He also explains the deep work of evolution making software models resembling the working of genes.In the mid chapters underlined the mportance of the fact of the cooperation of the genes in the evolution throught the relation with epigenetics and embriology,also explains the concept of punctuated equilibrium as a long standby followed by a fast evolution and it important role in the peciation and the existence of molecular clocks for measuring times and distances in evolutionary processes.In the final chapters confronts the different schools of taxonomy in clasifyng species and discuss the other failed schools of explanation of the origen of the species : creationism,saltationism,Lamarckism ( inherited features ) and some other.A excelent book in giving another perspetive of darvinian evolution,full of subtle concepts and reasonings that dismantle the creationism and other wrong theories."
13,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112699911-orhan-pelinkovic,5,"If you are interested in evolutionary biology I would highly recommend this book. The author is very aggressive in convincing the reader in evolution by means of cumulative natural selection compare to all the other beliefs (natural selection in one step, creationist, etc.)I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Slepi Časovničar autora Ričarda Dokinsa Heliks 2010 publishing / 496 pages / 133,407 words."
14,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"...one of my aims in the book is to convey something of the sheer wonder of biological complexity to those whose eyes have not been opened to it. But having built up the mystery, my other main aim is to remove it again by explaining the solution...He managed the above, but I didn't enjoy this as much as The Selfish Gene or The God Delusion. It delves deeper & wanders around Darwinian Evolution & other theories more than I want or need. I hadn't planned to read this since I understood this from his updated edition of The Selfish Gene, but I found it cheap & needed to bump my Amazon order a bit for free shipping. I'm glad I did.My interest varied & I don't think I would have gotten through a text version without a lot of skimming. He addresses issues/controversies in great detail that I didn't know existed nor was I particularly interested in them, so I found the long refutation boring. Often he digressed to build the knowledge & logic which proves why the other theory or claim is wrong. I find about half of these wanderings interesting, while some just beat the particular subject to death. He starts the preface with the following:This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet...So, I was easily able to finish it & even wanted more due to the wonderful narration &, for all that my interest flagged occasionally, there was plenty of fascinating material. That's incredible in light of the age of this book. Quite a few of the science books & articles I've read that were half as old were terribly dated, but Dawkins is dealing with the theory itself, how genetic change & natural selection works over long time periods to build complex systems, instead of details which may have been superseded as technology runs on. Some of the best parts are his opinions of other scientists. He's very fast to give credit to others where it is due. He touts other books & scientists as better or more thorough on some points while he is obviously incensed at a few. At one point, he finished a particularly scathing denunciation & said perhaps he should go out & dig up the garden. He didn't try for a lot of humor, but when it popped up like that it was great. Even when he's peeved, he is polite & gives them their due, though.His ability to simplify & make sense of large numbers & statistical probability is absolutely masterful. It was great to be able to fiddle with the biomorph program. A search for ""Biomorph Breeder Program"" brings up several interesting ones similar to those Dawkins wrote & used. I understood Dawkins' explanations just fine, but actually playing with the program is really worth it. The extreme effects of random change over time are amazing. He's right, we aren't equipped to really understand large numbers or long times, the obvious problem with Young Earth Creationists' beliefs. Of course, those I know somehow make intentional ignorance & a belief in magic a positive attribute. I find their intellectual dishonesty infuriating, especially so when they try to foist them on me, especially in matters of public policy. (Beliefs should remain private. Public discourse requires facts & logic or there can be no reasoning with each other.)One thing I really missed was an explanation of what a species is. (Does he address speciation in The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene?) For years I thought the criterion was simply the ability to breed with the result of fertile offspring. Then I read this article:https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/08...IOW, I was certain in my ignorance & now that I know more, I'm unsure & somewhat bewildered - a good thing from a scientific point of view, but the lack weakened his arguments a bit for me simply because I spent too much time wondering about it. Still, it had no real bearing on his argument even in the chapter on taxonomy. I had no idea taxonomists disagreed so much. I thought I was the only person who made such a muddle of filing. I loved Dawkins' comparisons to library science. It really made a lot more sense of clades & the various other organization schemes.Table of ContentsChapter I: Explaining the very improbableChapter 2: Good designChapter 3: Accumulating small changeChapter 4: Making tracks through animal spaceChapter 5: The power and the archivesChapter 6: Origins and miraclesChapter 7: Constructive evolutionChapter 8: Explosions and spiralsChapter 9: Puncturing punctuationismChapter 10: The one true tree of lifeChapter 11: Doomed rivalsIt was an excellent read & I'll be referring to parts of it the rest of my life. He says that Explaining is a difficult art. You can explain something so that your reader understands the words; and you can explain something so that the reader feels it in the marrow of his bones... He manages the latter most of the time. A truly gifted educator."
15,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Analyzes all the various flavors of Darwinist evolution and some competing theoriesRichard Dawkins is a very lucid and intelligent proponent of evolutionary theory and biology when he isn't getting into vitriolic debates with Creationists, which is an exercise in futility for both sides I'd say. I admire him for trying, but frankly trying to use logic and scientific reasoning with people who think the world is 6,000 years old, was created by an all-powerful being who somehow still tolerates Donald Trump's existence, explain the fossil record and dinosaurs as just tests of faith, and really think the universe is centered around planet Earth is truly a tase of time.So it's good to listen to a book that focuses on evolution, but as this book explores some of the subtle variants of evolutionary theory, like gradualists vs punctuationalists, dismantles Lamarkism and Lysenko, it feels a bit turgid at times, and I thought his much later book The Greatest Show on Earth was more interesting and focused on explaining what non-random natural selection means rather than debunking some other ""weak"" theories."
16,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Here are some key points I gathered from this wonderful wonderful book:- According to Dawkins, Darwinism seems to be more in need of advocacy than other branches of science. For instance, many people have no grasp of quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make them oppose the theory as nonsense. This could have religious implications.- One big problem with Darwinism is that everybody thinks he understands it.- The main reason why most people disbelieve Darwinism is that our brains are built to deal with events on radically different timescales from those that characterize evolutionary change. We have no difficulty visualizing processes that take seconds, minutes, years and decades at most to complete, whereas evolutionary change transpires in millions or hundreds of millions of years. - Man-made artifacts like computers and cars are obviously designed for a purpose, yet they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic rather than of flesh and blood. We are designed on a drawing board too, but were our parts assembled by a skilled engineer? the answer is no. When Charles Darwin first explained the matter, many people either wouldn't or couldn't grasp it.- This book is a rebuttal to William Paley's book (Which I have not read yet) called ""natural theology"". In this book which was lauded by Darwin and Dawkins as an inspiring book at the time, Paley uses the analogy of a watch you find in the middle of a road. Upon seeing such a complex apparatus (think of all the cogs and springs and things used in a watch to make it work), you immediately realize that it must be the product of some intelligent design. It makes no sense to declare it just happened to lie there higgledy-piggledy by mere chance or accident. According to Paley a human organ like an eye is much more complex than a watch, therefore like the watch which requires a watchmaker, the eye requires a designer, or does it?- According to Dawkins, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics. Natural selection is the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered. - Natural selection does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight. It can be said to play the role of the watchmaker in nature, but it's the blind watchmaker and hence the title of this book.- Evidence for evolution is overwhelming, in fact it is so overwhelming that even most theologians have given up believing in instantaneous creation. Nevertheless, many of these theologians have tried to smuggle God in by the back door, so to speak, and they allow him some sort of supervisory role over the course that evolution has taken. Dawkins rightly asserts that we cannot disprove beliefs like these. Be that as it may, there are some problems with these beliefs. Firstly, that they are superfluous and, secondly, that they assume the existence of the main thing we want to explain, namely organized complexity. If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guided evolution, that deity must have already been vastly complex in the first place. * This book is a must-read and highly recommended for anyone who is curious about nature. There are many things I learned like idea of arms races, or what mutations are and what's random and nonrandom and so much more. "

In the female birds' preference for a long tail section, it seems the female birds were in a dominant position in choosing what kind of male birds she likes, be they long tails or short tails. This reminds me of a hilarious essay of James Thurber which he wrote for The New Yorker in 1939 called Courtship Through the Ages.""Surely nothing in the astonishing scheme of life can have nonplused Nature so much as the fact that none of the females of any of the species she created really cared very much for the male, as such. For the past ten million years Nature has been busily inventing ways to make the male attractive to the female, but the whole business of courtship, from the marine annelids up to man, still lumbers heavily along, like a complicated musical comedy. I have been reading the sad and absorbing story in Volume 6 (Cole to Dama) of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In this volume you can learn about cricket, cotton, costume designing, crocodiles, crown jewels, and Coleridge, but none of this subject is so interesting as the Courtship of animals, which recounts the sorrowful lengths to which all males must go to arouse the interest of a lady.” I don't know why this essay suddenly occurred to me but I confess it is Quite an amusing story to read."
18,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"One of the best and most understandable arguments for evolutionary theory and natural selection Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.In the spirit of Darwin, Dawkins argues soundly, comprehensively, in this form of a non-fiction book rhetorically above average and merely correct. In contrast to his later work ""The God Delusion,"" which is so full of polemics, he refrains from doing so. He endeavors to provide factual and scientifically sound reasoning. Thus he celebrates the breathtaking emergence of highly sophisticated systems such as the human body with the apparent enthusiasm of an evolutionary biologist, who burns for his profession and also does not hesitate to lead various theses against the theory of evolution in the field. Mind you only around, to feed his lines, then enjoyable to dismantle piece by piece and to intone on their ruins a song of praise to the fantastic, developmental severe history of life. Ironically, the title of the work also refers to a book by the creationist pioneer William Paley, who wanted to use God in the form of a watchmaker to depict the ""production"" of all worldly components. Understandably, Dawkins could not resist alienating this clear image of his natural adversary for his purposes and turning the chronograph maker into an unconscious, a meaningless and blind metaphor for natural selection. As an illustration, object to be drawn through the book, the human eye was chosen. Its origins, shapes, and history of development make the reader pause in astonishment with fascinating insights into out of which amazing creatures our windows to the world have watched world eons of years ago.As long as Dawkins lingers in his field of study, the soundness of his lines of reasoning can hardly be counteracted, and until nowadays, this literature, which was published in 1986, cannot be compared with the writing of equal value. Unfortunately, an inappropriate and meanwhile more than obsolete attempt to show a kind of evolution based on the development of computer technology is to be found among the examples. This is a well-intentioned approach, to make the own theses seem even more comprehensive and to use artificial adaptations in as many subjects as possible to provide evidence. However, as in this case, it inevitably fails because of the dry basis and comprehensibility of the theses, which are too constructed and, funny enough, very much reminiscent of the custom of religious fanatics. These try to bend over and put a concept on everything. Also, the all specific too, rather short inserts on medicine and genetics are correct, but in contrast to the rest of the book exhausting to read. One notices that the actual primary operating field is left shortly. In general, the work would do a small renovation in the direction of the current state of research very well, so that the critical minds of the 21st century to have both well-founded and current reasoning for the hopefully eventually ended, meaningless dispute with ignorant people. Despite the small points of criticism an epochal work that seeks its equal in its timeless correctness and the significant, underlying concerns of the Enlightenment. It testifies to the enthusiasm to which professional occupation with the miracle of the creation of life can become. A fortunate coincidence, too, when this gift falls into the hands of a talented narrative man whose tactical acumen dictates that he should not encourage the prevention of water on the mills of his opponents. By withdrawing any basis of existence on a purely factual basis of any religious embarrassment, creation myth, and Genesis. Now the hard facts only have to flow into the consciousness of the people. Dropwise and very slowly. Sticky droplets.Eine der besten und verständlichsten Argumentationsführungen für Evolutionstheorie und natürliche SelektionGanz im Sinne Darwins argumentiert Dawkins stichhaltig, umfassend, in dieser Form für ein Sachbuch rhetorisch überdurchschnittlich gut und schlichtweg richtig. Er hält sich dabei im Gegensatz zu seinem späteren Werk Gotteswahn, das vor Polemik nur so strotzt, zurück. Er ist bemüht, eine sachliche und wissenschaftlich fundierte Argumentation abzuliefern. So feiert er die die atemberaubende Entstehung höchst diffiziler Systeme wie dem menschlichen Körper mit der spürbaren Begeisterung eines Evolutionsbiologen, der für sein Metier brennt und auch nicht davor zurückschreckt, verschiedenste Thesen gegen die Evolutionstheorie ins Feld zu führen. Wohlgemerkt nur um, sich selbst geschickt den Ball zuspielend, sie anschließend genussvoll Stück für Stück zu demontieren und auf ihren Trümmern ein Loblied auf die erstaunliche, seriöse Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebens anzustimmen.Ironisch ist auch der Titel des Werks zu verstehen, der sich auf ein Buch des kreationistischen Vordenkers William Paley bezieht, der anhand Gottes in Form eines Uhrmachers die „Fertigung“ sämtlicher weltlicher Bestandteile darstellen wollte. Verständlich, dass Dawkins nicht widerstehen konnte, dieses krasse Bild seines natürlichen Gegners für eigene Zwecke zu entfremden und aus dem Chronographenhersteller eine unbewusst, ohne Sinn und blind arbeitende Metapher für die natürliche Selektion zu machen.Als ein sich durch das Buch ziehendes Veranschaulichungsobjekt wurde das menschliche Auge gewählt. Dessen Ursprung, Formen und Entwicklungsgeschichte lassen mit den faszinierenden Erkenntnissen, aus welch unerwarteten Kreaturen unsere Fenster zur Welt vor Äonen von Jahren geblickt haben, den Leser vor Erstaunen innehalten. Solange Dawkins in seinem Fachbereich verweilt ist der Stichhaltigkeit seiner Argumentationsketten kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen und man kann diesem 1986 erschienen Werk bis heute wenig gleichwertige Literatur zur Seite stellen. Leider ist auch ein unpassender und mittlerweile mehr als nur veralteter Versuch, anhand der Entwicklung der Computertechnik eine Art von Evolution aufzeigen zu wollen, unter den Beispielen. Das ist ein gut gemeinter Ansatz, die eigenen Thesen noch umfassender erscheinen zu lassen und künstliche Adaptionen in möglichst vielen Themenkreisen zur Erbringung von Belegen heranzuziehen. Es scheitert aber, wie in diesem Fall, zwangsläufig an der unzureichenden Basis und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Thesen, die allzu konstruiert sind und lustigerweise sehr an den Usus der religiösen Fanatiker erinnern. Diese versuchen auch auf Biegen und Brechen ein Konzept über alles zu stülpen.Auch sind die allzu fachspezifisch ausgeführten, eher kurzen Einschübe über Medizin und Genetik zwar richtig, aber im Kontrast zum Rest des Buches anstrengend zu lesen. Man merkt, dass das eigentliche Hauptbetätigungsfeld kurzfristig verlassen wird. Generell täte dem Werk eine kleine Renovierung in Richtung des aktuellen Standes der Forschung sehr gut, damit auch die kritischen Geister des 21. Jahrhunderts sowohl wohlfundierte als auch aktuelle Argumentationen für den hoffentlich irgendwann beendeten, sinnbefreiten Disput mit ignoranten Mitmenschen haben.Trotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte eine epochales Werk, dass in seiner zeitlosen Richtigkeit und dem hehren, dahinterstehenden Anliegen der Aufklärung seinesgleichen sucht. Es zeugt von der Begeisterungsfähigkeit, zu der die berufliche Beschäftigung mit dem Wunder der Entstehung des Lebens werden kann. Ein glücklicher Zufall auch, wenn diese Gabe in die Hände eines noch dazu erzählerisch talentierten Mannes fällt, dessen taktischer Scharfsinn ihm gebietet, der Prävention des Wassers auf die Mühlen seiner Gegner keinen Vorschub zu leisten. Indem er auf einer rein sachlichen Basis jeglicher Art von religiöser Verbrämung, Schöpfungsmythos und Entstehungsmären jegliche Existenzgrundlage entzieht. Jetzt müssen die harten Fakten nur noch ins Bewusstsein der Menschen einfließen. Tröpfchenweise und sehr langsam. Klebrige Tröpfchen."
19,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,5,"The Blind Watchmaker is probably one of the best introductory books on evolution.Dawkins takes his time, explaining step by step how Darwinian evolution works.Dawkins explains at great length, how species that look like a ""complex design"" evolve with accumulating small changes via natural selection, why natural selection is ""blind""; ie. it lacks purpose, how random mutations combined with non-random natural selection is necessary for evolution to take place, and why a ""complex design"" does not necessarily mean a ""good design"" (such as ganglion cells which make the electronic wiring interface between the photocells and the brain, face light directly, whereas photocells sit away from the light source in human eye; compared to octopus eye that has photocells facing the light source).Then the structure of genetic blueprint (DNA) is explained; how DNA archives are being copied from cell to cell and from individual to individual, how copy errors are made, and how mutations can occur.In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity of pure randomness as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the Weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.If you are curious about evolution and choose the best introductory book on the subject this is the one."
20,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I enjoyed this book very much, despite the difficulty of reading the very small typeface. Dawkins' style is almost folksy, and not at all the arrogant, condescending style that some reviewers mention. The first chapter, about echolocation in bats, is fascinating. I also enjoyed reading about the different philosophies involved in taxonomy, the classification of species. Some reviewers mention that Dawkins' explanations are ""old hat"", and that the computer simulations are primitive; but they do need to keep in mind that the book is already 25 years old! While I do appreciate the arguments Dawkins puts forward against saltationists and punctuationalists, I found them to be repetitive and boring after a while."
21,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/490192-charles,2,"Enchantingly beautiful fiction, 23 Mar 2007  Musings of a fideist (a materialistic fideist). Richard Dawkins has a breathtaking gift for expressive, catchy writing. His handling of illustration and narrative flow like silk. Yet he reminds me of an eloquent 19th century clergyman. His persistent dedication to the high altar of gradualistic explanation, however incredibly improbable, stretches credulity to breaking point. Take for example his extraordinary leap on p.134, para 1, where self-replicating RNA will almost magically come into being - 'all so utterly simple and automatic'. There it is by fiat - Dawkins wishes and so it must be! Abracadabra! Those who have worked in the field know how fasitidious and temperamental RNA and enzymes can be even in the best conditions - yet here it is in rock pool. There are some problems even billions of years won't solve - ask the mathematicians. Or take his extraordinary and uncharacteristically rambling tautology about the peacock's tail, pp 203-206, which boils down to an unexplained discrepancy in tail length (p204) and majority female taste (p205)! This is no cogent defence of evolution of an extraordinarily complex structure, just a mystical will-of-the-wisp-like weaving of concepts to meet his desired end. He reiterates Darwin's acid test of his own theory, on p 91, but if really believed what he wrote there, he would have abandoned neo-Darwinism years ago - I have long since published one very clear example of what he seeks, and his written answer to me was that he couldn't answer it, and there are myriad more. Dawkins is a magician with words, though not as self critical and cautious as he ought to be with scientific argument. "
22,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"I have only ever read one other Dawkins book before, The God Delusion, and really didn't like the style or attitude of the writing, so was not completely looking forward to this one.The primary aim of the book is to look at all the evidence and theories that make up the Darwinian theory of evolution and natural selection. He considers all the evidence from real life examples, in particular the eye, and buy using a computer program that he wrote, demonstrates how new variants of a species can evolve with very simple initial amendments. Later on in the book he looks at how DNA works, the effects of positive feedback on evolution and the way that mutations works of evolution and selection. He also considers the complexity of trying to document the tree of life.Overall I thought this book was a better read than the previous one I had read. Bearing in mind it was written originally in 1986 most of it is still valid, though we now understand far more than we did then. He can get on his high horse quite often, but thankfully not so much in this book."

More people would be convinced watching an episode of Sagan's Cosmos than slugging through this book. I still remember how Cosmos changed the teenage me. Just remember the high-and-mighty all-smiles Sagan! This preacher, one Ricky Dawkins, with his pompous writing, repeating the same phrases, picking fight with other preachers of the same flock (like Reverend Steven J Gould) and offering the worldview that no other beliefs have a sensible place en este mundo may actually repulse a lot of would-be converts.But what I cannot deny is, I am a sucker for this preacher. Through and through."

I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:“A physicist certainly doesn’t need Darwinism in order to do physics. He might think that biology is a trivial subject compared with physics. It would follow from this that, in his opinion, Darwinism is of trivial importance to science. But he could not sensibly conclude from this that it is therefore false!”Understanding how Darwinian evolution works can change your attitude toward life and self, substantially. What we learned about Darwin at high school is inadequate. This book provides you with simplified biochemistry, biology, math, physics, and reasoning so that you can easily conceive why Darwinism is the most reasonable answer to world's complexity.I would like to quote another part:“In Darwin’s view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of complex adaptations. For what it is worth, it is also the whole point of this book. For Darwin, any evolution that had to be helped over the jumps by God was not evolution at all. It made a nonsense of the central point of evolution. In the light of this, it is easy to see why Darwin constantly reiterated the gradualness of evolution.”This way of thinking is not just confined to the past. Evolutionary-based science is taking over a lot of fields. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University is a leading one. You can find out more at: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/ "
25,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27367650-brian-cloutier,4,"The good part: Dawkins is a great writer. His style is very conversational and the book very quotable. His arguments follow a defined path but still manage to meander through welcome asides. He uses metaphors and thought experiments well, most of the book was very easy to follow.And what arguments he makes! The probability of miracles, potential precursors of RNA, the importance of gradual change. His goal is to show that it's possible to explain the rise of complexity from a simple world and he spectacularly succeeds.However, I'm likely not the intended audience of this book. He spent more time arguing against alternative theories than I would have liked. I had no idea what Mutationism was before he explained it but it sounded dumb within the first few sentences; he didn't need to spend as many pages dismissing it as he did. Same with the entire chapter on Punctuationism. The first few pages went over some really cool notes on speciation and how some large mutations fit into darwinism that the book wouldn't have been complete without. The rest of the chapter tried to defend darwinism from a media I had never paid attention to in the first place.The last third of the book is worth reading because it contains a few insights. But, finishing it is true drudgery and tarnishes my impression of the book as a whole."

When they say: 'nature designed a creature like this and that.', 'it gave them wings' etc. I was thinking: 'What nonsense is this? It's not possible, nature isn't smart to design a complex creature'. But, I was all wrong.Nature doesn't have to be smart to design something. Living beings don't emerge by luck or chance but from necessity. Small and gradual steps make those creatures climb mount improbable, and they happen to look like highly designed creatures.True knowledge not always resides within your gut instincts and common sense. For example, the book explains that if there's a grand designer, it must have been designed too. Therefore, as the book shows, there is no design, only emergence. Only you need to have an open mind to see the truth. Think logically, you will find the truth."

With a contagious passion and a load of patience (because, quite frankly, you need a massive amount of it to face the rubbish circulating on such topics!) the biologist is once again enchanting us. In fact, we feel like a little child holding his hand, admiring all the wonders he's pointing at: nature is wonderful as it is; don't be afraid to toss God (or whatever you want to call it) in the bin.

31,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"I should explain the point about the watchmaker. A SMALL ROCKIf you’re walking along in the countryside and you come across a rock, you don’t say, well, where the hell did that come from and who made it? It’s a rock. No one cares. There’s no notices stuck on trees or printed in local free newspapers anywhere saying “have you seen this rock? Description – roughly three inches by four by three; last seen in the Dorchester area; undistinctive grey colouring; answers to the name of “rock”; reward – please call this number; WE MISS YOU ROCK” . It’s a rock. ON THE OTHER HAND, A GOLD WATCHNow, if you saw a beautiful gold watch on your walk in the countryside, you would say – lo! a watch – I deduce that someone has lost a watch and it is here; also, I furthermore deduce that there must be a God.” Richard Dawkins says that watches, or indeed anything complicated, do not infer the existence of a watchmaker. Or, to use a different analogy, a book, which can be a complicated thing, does not infer the existence of an author. You could say well, here’s a book called The Blind Watchmaker and it says it’s by Richard Dawkins, so we see that Richard Dawkins is the author and he wrote this book, but Richard Dawkins would say NO! it doesn’t, have you not been paying attention, have you been giggling and passing notes in the back row again? EVOLUTION OF THE SEMICOLONWhat happened is that gradually, over many billions of years, language formed, inconceivably slowly, for instance it took ten million years for commas to evolve out of a full stop, and another ten million for the exotic semi-colon to evolve out of the comma. So this book The Blind Watchmaker (like all other books) evolved slowly. We have fossils to prove this. They show the missing links. We have, for instance, copies of the book which are called The Blond Watchmaker dating from the Devonian period – it took several millions of years for the Blond to evolve into the Blind, you see. I read that Mexican paleontologists recently unearthed a copy called The Bland Watchmaker. Going back further , we find all sorts of evolutionary byways that, because of natural selection, died out eventually. One manuscript from the late Pleistocene period which is currently on display at the University of East Anglia shows a strange hybrid between an early version of The Blind Watchmaker and Alice in Wonderland in which the famous teaparty scene features a pterodactyl, a plesiosaur (so very unlikely) and a crazed archaeopteryx. This unviable literary form did not survive, as we know. Natural selection, although brutal from our limited human perspective, explains the evolution of complex things. RELIGION CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY TWILIGHT IS POPULARGod cannot explain why the book species “Stephanie Myers” and “Dan Brown”, for instance, proliferate wildly in many varied habitats, whilst arguably more beautiful forms like Henry James, Proust, and the Golden Tamarin dwindle to the point where human intervention from libraries and literary professors are the only thing keeping them from sinking into oblivion – no, God cannot explain this. But Richard Dawkins (also known as ""Science"") can.Sorry, that should be “Richard Dawkins”."
32,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dawkins loves explaining evolutionary theory, and this is one of his best books. My favourite bit is the section on long-tailed birds (peacocks, etc). From the point of view of simple utility, they are rather baffling. What use could you possibly have for that long, stupid tail?But, as Dawkins keeps reminding us, it's not about survival of the species, or even of the individual, but rather of the gene. Suppose there's a sex-linked male gene that disposes towards long tails, and a sex-linked female gene that disposes towards finding long tails attractive. A child born of a union between two individuals carrying these genes will be likely to have both of them. Hence, if it's male, it'll have a long tail, and if it's female it will prefer males with long tails. If this combination becomes common, long-tailed males will have a larger and larger advantage in terms of being preferred by females. Tails will lengthen until the practical downside (being unable to fly, avoid predators, etc) counterbalances the upside of efficiently attracting potential mates.I read this, and suddenly looked at supermodels in a new light. God, they're hot! In fact, if they were any hotter they'd be dead. "

Read it for yourself.All his arguments are crystal clear, but he takes extra time to caricature the caricature of Darwinists, pointing out exactly how the ad absurdum argument really works while also elucidating the fine points of what Darwinism IS versus what it is NOT.He steps us through the first third of the book showing us how Selection works: from an energy standpoint, a competition standpoint, and a sexual standpoint... from the basic building blocks of proteins to more and more complex forms of DNA and the combo cells that collect all the wonderful multicellular creations, including bacteria, that eventually wind up creating us. The descriptions are quite beautiful and clear and all the while, we've got all the foundations for life... without Intelligent Design. The argument is simple, of course. If we can explain everything, and I mean everything that is life and physics, then what purpose does adding a superfluous layer to the explanation serve?This is ten years worth of hate mail for the author, people. He has been beset on all sides with genuinely curious and well-meaning seekers of the god-fearing sort and inundated with screaming lunatics telling him he'll burn in hell for his first book, The Selfish Gene, which, by the way, didn't really give a rat's ass about creationism or the people who support it. It just laid out a very cogent theory that fit all the copious mountains of data in biology. And yet, after that point, a Mr. Dawkins who professes not to want or need a PR team or lawyers, decides to put his foot down and tackle the problem that has reared its muti-angled head in his direction and DEFEND Darwinism.He does so beautifully, I might add. Every step of the way, he defines the complaints with due diligence and proceeds to demolish them sonar-producing batlike grace, with light humor, sharp intellect, and sometimes he makes of his opponents an overzealous meal. Can you blame him? Granted, by this point it's only been a decade of Creationist hate. Give it a decade or a decade and a half more before we see a truly flame worthy attack from Mr.Dawkins. I'm looking forward to seeing some of it in his books. I hope it's there and not just in his interviews which I still haven't seen. Alas.Seriously, though, this book is pretty wonderful for its lucid and quoteworthy passages and vivid descriptions of how Darwinism works, from gene level to the kinds of time-spans that can only be described as geological when it comes to real changes in evolution. I particularly loved the fact that he used computer terminology to describe how our genes are nothing more than complex computers. I've heard this before, of course, but the way he laid it out was particularly enlightening.This stuff is pretty damn great. Just from the science viewpoint, even leaving out the whole defense, it's well worth reading and not nearly as acerbic or rabid as certain other mass-produced troll-attacks make him appear. But then again, I've only read one of his later books, the The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, which was just a charming bi-modal description of science versus magical thinking which also happened to ""gently"" draw people away from having to add that extra layer of explanation to reality. :) I guess I'll see what the other books bring, no?"

Of course, he turned out to be more accurate than he must have wished for. This must be the most boring of all Dawkins’ books, but I do not want to give up on him till I read ‘The Extended Phenotype’ which just might prove to be the best (scientifically) of all his works. With whole chapters devoted to the driest taxonomy problems and to disproving outdated theories, the book was a massive waste of time once I went past the mildly interesting first half. But, it still provides an opportunity to use Dawkins’ own method of caricature-based argument to paint a caricature of his own positions in ‘The God Delusion’ based on his own vitriolic stands in this book. I will try to examine in detail how Dawkins has betrayed his own principles of scientific grounding and rational rigorousness in The God Delusion by using arguments and structures from this book in the review. Hopefully that will happen by tomorrow..."

But I guess its complexity is pretty relevant to the level of articulation many have. However, it was a great read and made me think more about the topic. "
36,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1402463-mostephl,5,"wow and double wow. i read this through and turned back to p.1 to read it again. blind watchmaker has been amazingly influential in the way i think about just about everything- the world, existence, life forms, physics- down to the micro, myself and my craft. it's sent chills down my spine, made me euphoric and angry. the first for finally addressing questions that have long been in my mind (but receive no echo in society as i've known it), the second for the willful repression of information and large-scale institutionalized dumb-down that is the public school system i grew up in. it makes me want to cry to think that i didn't learn about evolution until i already had a master's degree. i am learning now, though, largely through dawkins, stephen j. gould and others who've been able to bring the complexities of this subject to the laypeople. still angry that whatever my daughter learns about evolution, she'll have to learn from me, a social scientist and by no means an authority. nonetheless, in a college classroom if her professor asks if anyone's heard of darwin, her answer will be a resounding, ""yeah!!"". small victory, but something.p.s. there's a great, great BBC documentary on Galapagos- highly worth checking out. "
37,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34331-laura,2,"This book was okay, but since I already am convinced evolution occurs by natural selection, I felt like he was not preaching to the choir, but trying to convince the choir. Of course, I got tired of it after a while (but I had to keep going, because I had to read it for a class). He comes up with many different arguments/theories for how evolution/natural selection could occur, many of which are interesting, but I would just rather read a science book rather than a philosophical book on evolution. For instance, I recommend The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner, which shows how scientists study evolution and natural selection in action. "
38,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Two summers ago, I did myself the favor of reading The Selfish Gene. Well, I didn’t quite read it; rather, I listened to Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, narrate the book, as I took long walks in the forest near my house. Incidentally, I think Dawkins (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lalla) has a magnificent voice; it’s a pleasure to hear him speak.  But that’s a matter of taste; what is not a matter of taste is the quality of that book. Agree or disagree with Dawkins, one must admit that The Selfish Gene is a book of the finest quality. Indeed, I must say that I wasn’t quite prepared for how good it was. I was expecting an entertaining book of popular science; what I got was an eloquent, subtle, and powerful book which managed, in a just a couple weeks of long walks, to completely transform my understanding of animal behavior. This book, The Blind Watchmaker—also listened to in a few long walks—is not of the same caliber. But it is quite good. (Well, if it were written by almost anybody except Dawkins himself, I would say it was very good—but I know the heights he can reach.) I know close to nothing about his advocacy of atheism, and frankly I don’t much care, but I think the public has a rare treasure in Dawkins; what other popular biology writer can compare? Dawkins is, to an almost remarkable extent, as much a philosopher as a scientist. This book, as well as his first, is jammed full of thought experiments; Dawkins simply can’t get enough of them. This emphasis on philosophical argumentation allows him, so to speak, to take the reader inside the logic of Darwinism (as well as inside the fuzzy logic of Darwinism’s opponents). He doesn’t simply tell the reader things biologists think—like a reporter sending dispatches from the front lines—but tries to get the layreader to understand exactly why biologists think what they do. As a result, his books can actually be a bit dense and exhausting; but the patient reader is amply rewarded with a deepened understanding. The main reason that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as his first was that Dawkins spends an awful lot of time dealing with contemporary controversies. This was, I believe, a time of the famed ‘Darwin Wars’, when Gould and his followers had highly publicized debates with team Dawkins. Apparently, reporters were very eager to report anything even slightly critical of Darwinian theory—whether it be from taxonomists, paleontologists, or priests—so Dawkins was forced to spend a lot of time on material that, to today’s reader, may be of limited interest. For example, Dawkins becomes almost pedantic in his chapter on punctuated equilibrium, as he argues again and again that Gould is not a ‘true’ saltationist, but only a modified gradualist. Having read Gould, I was personally interested in this; but I would understand if others were not. Perhaps I was not the book’s target audience, as I needed no convincing that Darwinian evolution is both a well-supported and a powerful theory. Nonetheless, Dawkins did manage to clear up some of evolution’s finer point for me. I was particularly excited when (not to take too much credit) Dawkins confirmed a suspicion that I had expressed a few years back, when I was learning about human evolution. I was actually in Kenya, studying with the Leakeys, who—being the Leakeys—had plastic casts of several dozen important hominin fossils in their lab. As my anatomy teacher enjoyed pointing out, the vast majority of hominin fossils for any given species can fit inside a shoebox. Most of the fossils are distorted, broken, or otherwise fragmentary. Yet from these scant remains, paleoanthropologists expend tremendous energy arguing about the hominin family tree. Is this skull cap Homo erectus or Homo habilis? Is this thigh bone from an early homo or a late autralopithecus? Somewhat exasperated by all this ambiguity—about what appeared to me to be a matter of words—I got an idea: what if the idea of ‘species’ itself breaks down in an evolutionary timescale? After all, if we believe that species change via gradual selection one to another, it follows that there must be individuals intermediate between any two given hominin species, and, furthermore, individuals intermediate between the intermediates—and so on. Eureka! Well, it turns out Dawkins (as well as many other, probably) had the very same idea long before; it appears that convergent evolution is even more prevalent among memes than genes. (As a side note, if one believes, like Gould, in punctuated equilibrium, then ‘species’ would still be valid in an evolutionary timescale. Perhaps this is why the paleoanthropologists are still arguing?) I got sidetracked—back to the book. (Speaking of sidetracked, Dawkins is the master of the interesting aside and the lengthy digression; and, even more impressively, he always manages to tie his asides and digressions neatly back into the main theme under discussion.) Well, I’m afraid I don’t have very much more to say, other than this: if you find yourself with a supply of long walks, and need an audiobook as accompaniment, you might as well download Dawkins’s crisp, dry, whispery voice, and deepen your understanding of the flora and fauna around you—whether it be this book or, if you want a real treat, his first."
39,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd,5,"Dawkins is one of my top picks for the most articulate, engaging and proficient scientists I've read to date. The Blind Watchmaker turned out to be a very prolific piece. I was baffled by his logical analogies, most excellent examples and extremely engaging vernacular. In this work, one learns much about the evolutionary adaptations of numerous species, of which the sonar technology of baths, dolphins and other mammals seemed most shocking.His reasoning of what constitutes miracles, probability theory and reasoning behind the drawback of the Lamark's theory of acquired characteristics is exceptionally enticing. The book should be a required high-school reading. A very, very high recommendation."
40,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7503511-seth-hanson,4,"At the time, this was a tough book for me to read. Considering the way I was raised - in a heavily religious atmosphere - it was hard for me to accept the theory of evolution. However, Dawkins very clearly lays out the theory in a way that anyone can understand if they are willing to open their mind just a little and put in just a little effort. It might be hard to accept but its even harder to dispute. Reality is like that. I think everyone should be required to read this book. "
41,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins’ outstanding The Selfish Gene, my initial impression of The Blind Watchmaker was a bit of a letdown. Dawkins wrote the book to counter creationist thinking, but for a firm believer in Darwinian evolution, his lengthy arguments were unnecessary. However, if Dawkins converted any creationists, I would consider the book a great success. With that said, there were a number of things I did like. Below are some items that caught my attention.Darwin’s concept of gradual evolution overturned the ideas of the catastrophists, who believed the earth and its creatures were formed by sudden drastic changes. Gradual evolution was then challenged by saltationists who believed large genetic changes or macro-mutations could explain much of evolution. A more refined view is that of Stephen Jay Gould who posited punctuated equilibrium. This view recognized varying rates of change, periods of relative stasis with intervals of rapid modification. Keep in mind rapid was on a geologic time scale where 50,000 years is a short time. Thus Gould’s rapid change could still have evolved step-by-step in line with Darwin. The effect of gradualism that struck me was the notion that speciation is contingent on the demise of intermediate individuals. Otherwise one could not tell where one species began and another ended.An upshot of Dawkins’ idea concerns our own connection with our ancestors. The view of chimpanzees as property is made more acceptable because there are no living intermediaries that show our close relationship. This made me wonder how Neanderthals would be treated if some were found alive. Would they be treated like chimpanzees as a different species? Since they are beings who can successfully interbreed with Homo sapiens, would they be given the same rights? Would Christians consider them as individuals with souls that should be saved? I enjoyed Dawkins explanation of the development of the eye in support of gradualism. The book’s title comes from a pre-Darwin argument that if one found a watch, one would have to assume someone made it. The watch is too intricate to have formed naturally. Post-Darwin, like the watch, some held that the eye was so complex as to defy gradual evolution. Dawkins counters. He takes us from a cell with a light sensitive spot to a creature with several such cells that is helped by this sense of light or dark. Then if the light sensitive cells are recessed, the creature can tell the direction of the shadow. If the recess takes on a cuplike shape, this sense of the light’s direction is enhanced. Next if the walls of the cup build up and protrude partially over the cup, a pinhole camera is formed casting an image on the cup. Then, protecting the cup by extending a membrane over the pinhole forms a lens. And so on…I enjoyed the section on bats and echolocation. Dawkins also offers a reasonable explanation of how this seemingly amazing ability could develop. Dolphins, whales and some birds have independently developed this use of sound showing such development not to be quite as extraordinary as one might think. Dawkins pondering of how bats experience this sense I found fascinating. Do the nerve impulses get mapped by the brain to a model similar to the one we experience as vision? And then there is the fish that senses its environment from disruption to an electrical field – elctrolocation. How is this sense perceived? Another intriguing topic was how sexual selection augments natural selection. Unlike environmental factors which wax and wane in intensity, sexual selection forms a positive feedback loop. A female bird’s preference for long tails in her mate not only promotes the gene for long tails but the gene for the desire for long tails. As both genes proliferate tails will grow longer until a practical limit is reached. The bird still has to be an able flyer to survive. One’s mind quickly turns to how this idea works in humans.This book will mean different things to different readers. Every creationist should read it although I suspect few will. For the rest of us, the book is still worthwhile just to get Dawkins’ unique views on odd and end topics, a few of which I covered. If you get bored reading why creationism is wrong, keep in mind the book is written to be easily read, so you can get through those sections quickly."

44,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"...one of my aims in the book is to convey something of the sheer wonder of biological complexity to those whose eyes have not been opened to it. But having built up the mystery, my other main aim is to remove it again by explaining the solution...He managed the above, but I didn't enjoy this as much as The Selfish Gene or The God Delusion. It delves deeper & wanders around Darwinian Evolution & other theories more than I want or need. I hadn't planned to read this since I understood this from his updated edition of The Selfish Gene, but I found it cheap & needed to bump my Amazon order a bit for free shipping. I'm glad I did.My interest varied & I don't think I would have gotten through a text version without a lot of skimming. He addresses issues/controversies in great detail that I didn't know existed nor was I particularly interested in them, so I found the long refutation boring. Often he digressed to build the knowledge & logic which proves why the other theory or claim is wrong. I find about half of these wanderings interesting, while some just beat the particular subject to death. He starts the preface with the following:This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet...So, I was easily able to finish it & even wanted more due to the wonderful narration &, for all that my interest flagged occasionally, there was plenty of fascinating material. That's incredible in light of the age of this book. Quite a few of the science books & articles I've read that were half as old were terribly dated, but Dawkins is dealing with the theory itself, how genetic change & natural selection works over long time periods to build complex systems, instead of details which may have been superseded as technology runs on. Some of the best parts are his opinions of other scientists. He's very fast to give credit to others where it is due. He touts other books & scientists as better or more thorough on some points while he is obviously incensed at a few. At one point, he finished a particularly scathing denunciation & said perhaps he should go out & dig up the garden. He didn't try for a lot of humor, but when it popped up like that it was great. Even when he's peeved, he is polite & gives them their due, though.His ability to simplify & make sense of large numbers & statistical probability is absolutely masterful. It was great to be able to fiddle with the biomorph program. A search for ""Biomorph Breeder Program"" brings up several interesting ones similar to those Dawkins wrote & used. I understood Dawkins' explanations just fine, but actually playing with the program is really worth it. The extreme effects of random change over time are amazing. He's right, we aren't equipped to really understand large numbers or long times, the obvious problem with Young Earth Creationists' beliefs. Of course, those I know somehow make intentional ignorance & a belief in magic a positive attribute. I find their intellectual dishonesty infuriating, especially so when they try to foist them on me, especially in matters of public policy. (Beliefs should remain private. Public discourse requires facts & logic or there can be no reasoning with each other.)One thing I really missed was an explanation of what a species is. (Does he address speciation in The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene?) For years I thought the criterion was simply the ability to breed with the result of fertile offspring. Then I read this article:https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/08...IOW, I was certain in my ignorance & now that I know more, I'm unsure & somewhat bewildered - a good thing from a scientific point of view, but the lack weakened his arguments a bit for me simply because I spent too much time wondering about it. Still, it had no real bearing on his argument even in the chapter on taxonomy. I had no idea taxonomists disagreed so much. I thought I was the only person who made such a muddle of filing. I loved Dawkins' comparisons to library science. It really made a lot more sense of clades & the various other organization schemes.Table of ContentsChapter I: Explaining the very improbableChapter 2: Good designChapter 3: Accumulating small changeChapter 4: Making tracks through animal spaceChapter 5: The power and the archivesChapter 6: Origins and miraclesChapter 7: Constructive evolutionChapter 8: Explosions and spiralsChapter 9: Puncturing punctuationismChapter 10: The one true tree of lifeChapter 11: Doomed rivalsIt was an excellent read & I'll be referring to parts of it the rest of my life. He says that Explaining is a difficult art. You can explain something so that your reader understands the words; and you can explain something so that the reader feels it in the marrow of his bones... He manages the latter most of the time. A truly gifted educator."
45,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Analyzes all the various flavors of Darwinist evolution and some competing theoriesRichard Dawkins is a very lucid and intelligent proponent of evolutionary theory and biology when he isn't getting into vitriolic debates with Creationists, which is an exercise in futility for both sides I'd say. I admire him for trying, but frankly trying to use logic and scientific reasoning with people who think the world is 6,000 years old, was created by an all-powerful being who somehow still tolerates Donald Trump's existence, explain the fossil record and dinosaurs as just tests of faith, and really think the universe is centered around planet Earth is truly a tase of time.So it's good to listen to a book that focuses on evolution, but as this book explores some of the subtle variants of evolutionary theory, like gradualists vs punctuationalists, dismantles Lamarkism and Lysenko, it feels a bit turgid at times, and I thought his much later book The Greatest Show on Earth was more interesting and focused on explaining what non-random natural selection means rather than debunking some other ""weak"" theories."
46,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Here are some key points I gathered from this wonderful wonderful book:- According to Dawkins, Darwinism seems to be more in need of advocacy than other branches of science. For instance, many people have no grasp of quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make them oppose the theory as nonsense. This could have religious implications.- One big problem with Darwinism is that everybody thinks he understands it.- The main reason why most people disbelieve Darwinism is that our brains are built to deal with events on radically different timescales from those that characterize evolutionary change. We have no difficulty visualizing processes that take seconds, minutes, years and decades at most to complete, whereas evolutionary change transpires in millions or hundreds of millions of years. - Man-made artifacts like computers and cars are obviously designed for a purpose, yet they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic rather than of flesh and blood. We are designed on a drawing board too, but were our parts assembled by a skilled engineer? the answer is no. When Charles Darwin first explained the matter, many people either wouldn't or couldn't grasp it.- This book is a rebuttal to William Paley's book (Which I have not read yet) called ""natural theology"". In this book which was lauded by Darwin and Dawkins as an inspiring book at the time, Paley uses the analogy of a watch you find in the middle of a road. Upon seeing such a complex apparatus (think of all the cogs and springs and things used in a watch to make it work), you immediately realize that it must be the product of some intelligent design. It makes no sense to declare it just happened to lie there higgledy-piggledy by mere chance or accident. According to Paley a human organ like an eye is much more complex than a watch, therefore like the watch which requires a watchmaker, the eye requires a designer, or does it?- According to Dawkins, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics. Natural selection is the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered. - Natural selection does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight. It can be said to play the role of the watchmaker in nature, but it's the blind watchmaker and hence the title of this book.- Evidence for evolution is overwhelming, in fact it is so overwhelming that even most theologians have given up believing in instantaneous creation. Nevertheless, many of these theologians have tried to smuggle God in by the back door, so to speak, and they allow him some sort of supervisory role over the course that evolution has taken. Dawkins rightly asserts that we cannot disprove beliefs like these. Be that as it may, there are some problems with these beliefs. Firstly, that they are superfluous and, secondly, that they assume the existence of the main thing we want to explain, namely organized complexity. If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guided evolution, that deity must have already been vastly complex in the first place. * This book is a must-read and highly recommended for anyone who is curious about nature. There are many things I learned like idea of arms races, or what mutations are and what's random and nonrandom and so much more. "
47,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"Some parts of the book are quite intriguing while a few chapters carry some ponderousness, leaving me in a bewilderment of what Dawkins intends to convey .Just put aside the evolutionary theory and natural selection and find something amusing. In the female birds' preference for a long tail section, it seems the female birds were in a dominant position in choosing what kind of male birds she likes, be they long tails or short tails. This reminds me of a hilarious essay of James Thurber which he wrote for The New Yorker in 1939 called Courtship Through the Ages.""Surely nothing in the astonishing scheme of life can have nonplused Nature so much as the fact that none of the females of any of the species she created really cared very much for the male, as such. For the past ten million years Nature has been busily inventing ways to make the male attractive to the female, but the whole business of courtship, from the marine annelids up to man, still lumbers heavily along, like a complicated musical comedy. I have been reading the sad and absorbing story in Volume 6 (Cole to Dama) of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In this volume you can learn about cricket, cotton, costume designing, crocodiles, crown jewels, and Coleridge, but none of this subject is so interesting as the Courtship of animals, which recounts the sorrowful lengths to which all males must go to arouse the interest of a lady.” I don't know why this essay suddenly occurred to me but I confess it is Quite an amusing story to read."
48,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"One of the best and most understandable arguments for evolutionary theory and natural selection Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.In the spirit of Darwin, Dawkins argues soundly, comprehensively, in this form of a non-fiction book rhetorically above average and merely correct. In contrast to his later work ""The God Delusion,"" which is so full of polemics, he refrains from doing so. He endeavors to provide factual and scientifically sound reasoning. Thus he celebrates the breathtaking emergence of highly sophisticated systems such as the human body with the apparent enthusiasm of an evolutionary biologist, who burns for his profession and also does not hesitate to lead various theses against the theory of evolution in the field. Mind you only around, to feed his lines, then enjoyable to dismantle piece by piece and to intone on their ruins a song of praise to the fantastic, developmental severe history of life. Ironically, the title of the work also refers to a book by the creationist pioneer William Paley, who wanted to use God in the form of a watchmaker to depict the ""production"" of all worldly components. Understandably, Dawkins could not resist alienating this clear image of his natural adversary for his purposes and turning the chronograph maker into an unconscious, a meaningless and blind metaphor for natural selection. As an illustration, object to be drawn through the book, the human eye was chosen. Its origins, shapes, and history of development make the reader pause in astonishment with fascinating insights into out of which amazing creatures our windows to the world have watched world eons of years ago.As long as Dawkins lingers in his field of study, the soundness of his lines of reasoning can hardly be counteracted, and until nowadays, this literature, which was published in 1986, cannot be compared with the writing of equal value. Unfortunately, an inappropriate and meanwhile more than obsolete attempt to show a kind of evolution based on the development of computer technology is to be found among the examples. This is a well-intentioned approach, to make the own theses seem even more comprehensive and to use artificial adaptations in as many subjects as possible to provide evidence. However, as in this case, it inevitably fails because of the dry basis and comprehensibility of the theses, which are too constructed and, funny enough, very much reminiscent of the custom of religious fanatics. These try to bend over and put a concept on everything. Also, the all specific too, rather short inserts on medicine and genetics are correct, but in contrast to the rest of the book exhausting to read. One notices that the actual primary operating field is left shortly. In general, the work would do a small renovation in the direction of the current state of research very well, so that the critical minds of the 21st century to have both well-founded and current reasoning for the hopefully eventually ended, meaningless dispute with ignorant people. Despite the small points of criticism an epochal work that seeks its equal in its timeless correctness and the significant, underlying concerns of the Enlightenment. It testifies to the enthusiasm to which professional occupation with the miracle of the creation of life can become. A fortunate coincidence, too, when this gift falls into the hands of a talented narrative man whose tactical acumen dictates that he should not encourage the prevention of water on the mills of his opponents. By withdrawing any basis of existence on a purely factual basis of any religious embarrassment, creation myth, and Genesis. Now the hard facts only have to flow into the consciousness of the people. Dropwise and very slowly. Sticky droplets.Eine der besten und verständlichsten Argumentationsführungen für Evolutionstheorie und natürliche SelektionGanz im Sinne Darwins argumentiert Dawkins stichhaltig, umfassend, in dieser Form für ein Sachbuch rhetorisch überdurchschnittlich gut und schlichtweg richtig. Er hält sich dabei im Gegensatz zu seinem späteren Werk Gotteswahn, das vor Polemik nur so strotzt, zurück. Er ist bemüht, eine sachliche und wissenschaftlich fundierte Argumentation abzuliefern. So feiert er die die atemberaubende Entstehung höchst diffiziler Systeme wie dem menschlichen Körper mit der spürbaren Begeisterung eines Evolutionsbiologen, der für sein Metier brennt und auch nicht davor zurückschreckt, verschiedenste Thesen gegen die Evolutionstheorie ins Feld zu führen. Wohlgemerkt nur um, sich selbst geschickt den Ball zuspielend, sie anschließend genussvoll Stück für Stück zu demontieren und auf ihren Trümmern ein Loblied auf die erstaunliche, seriöse Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebens anzustimmen.Ironisch ist auch der Titel des Werks zu verstehen, der sich auf ein Buch des kreationistischen Vordenkers William Paley bezieht, der anhand Gottes in Form eines Uhrmachers die „Fertigung“ sämtlicher weltlicher Bestandteile darstellen wollte. Verständlich, dass Dawkins nicht widerstehen konnte, dieses krasse Bild seines natürlichen Gegners für eigene Zwecke zu entfremden und aus dem Chronographenhersteller eine unbewusst, ohne Sinn und blind arbeitende Metapher für die natürliche Selektion zu machen.Als ein sich durch das Buch ziehendes Veranschaulichungsobjekt wurde das menschliche Auge gewählt. Dessen Ursprung, Formen und Entwicklungsgeschichte lassen mit den faszinierenden Erkenntnissen, aus welch unerwarteten Kreaturen unsere Fenster zur Welt vor Äonen von Jahren geblickt haben, den Leser vor Erstaunen innehalten. Solange Dawkins in seinem Fachbereich verweilt ist der Stichhaltigkeit seiner Argumentationsketten kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen und man kann diesem 1986 erschienen Werk bis heute wenig gleichwertige Literatur zur Seite stellen. Leider ist auch ein unpassender und mittlerweile mehr als nur veralteter Versuch, anhand der Entwicklung der Computertechnik eine Art von Evolution aufzeigen zu wollen, unter den Beispielen. Das ist ein gut gemeinter Ansatz, die eigenen Thesen noch umfassender erscheinen zu lassen und künstliche Adaptionen in möglichst vielen Themenkreisen zur Erbringung von Belegen heranzuziehen. Es scheitert aber, wie in diesem Fall, zwangsläufig an der unzureichenden Basis und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Thesen, die allzu konstruiert sind und lustigerweise sehr an den Usus der religiösen Fanatiker erinnern. Diese versuchen auch auf Biegen und Brechen ein Konzept über alles zu stülpen.Auch sind die allzu fachspezifisch ausgeführten, eher kurzen Einschübe über Medizin und Genetik zwar richtig, aber im Kontrast zum Rest des Buches anstrengend zu lesen. Man merkt, dass das eigentliche Hauptbetätigungsfeld kurzfristig verlassen wird. Generell täte dem Werk eine kleine Renovierung in Richtung des aktuellen Standes der Forschung sehr gut, damit auch die kritischen Geister des 21. Jahrhunderts sowohl wohlfundierte als auch aktuelle Argumentationen für den hoffentlich irgendwann beendeten, sinnbefreiten Disput mit ignoranten Mitmenschen haben.Trotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte eine epochales Werk, dass in seiner zeitlosen Richtigkeit und dem hehren, dahinterstehenden Anliegen der Aufklärung seinesgleichen sucht. Es zeugt von der Begeisterungsfähigkeit, zu der die berufliche Beschäftigung mit dem Wunder der Entstehung des Lebens werden kann. Ein glücklicher Zufall auch, wenn diese Gabe in die Hände eines noch dazu erzählerisch talentierten Mannes fällt, dessen taktischer Scharfsinn ihm gebietet, der Prävention des Wassers auf die Mühlen seiner Gegner keinen Vorschub zu leisten. Indem er auf einer rein sachlichen Basis jeglicher Art von religiöser Verbrämung, Schöpfungsmythos und Entstehungsmären jegliche Existenzgrundlage entzieht. Jetzt müssen die harten Fakten nur noch ins Bewusstsein der Menschen einfließen. Tröpfchenweise und sehr langsam. Klebrige Tröpfchen."
49,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,5,"The Blind Watchmaker is probably one of the best introductory books on evolution.Dawkins takes his time, explaining step by step how Darwinian evolution works.Dawkins explains at great length, how species that look like a ""complex design"" evolve with accumulating small changes via natural selection, why natural selection is ""blind""; ie. it lacks purpose, how random mutations combined with non-random natural selection is necessary for evolution to take place, and why a ""complex design"" does not necessarily mean a ""good design"" (such as ganglion cells which make the electronic wiring interface between the photocells and the brain, face light directly, whereas photocells sit away from the light source in human eye; compared to octopus eye that has photocells facing the light source).Then the structure of genetic blueprint (DNA) is explained; how DNA archives are being copied from cell to cell and from individual to individual, how copy errors are made, and how mutations can occur.In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity of pure randomness as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the Weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.If you are curious about evolution and choose the best introductory book on the subject this is the one."

Dawkins' style is almost folksy, and not at all the arrogant, condescending style that some reviewers mention. The first chapter, about echolocation in bats, is fascinating. I also enjoyed reading about the different philosophies involved in taxonomy, the classification of species. Some reviewers mention that Dawkins' explanations are ""old hat"", and that the computer simulations are primitive; but they do need to keep in mind that the book is already 25 years old! While I do appreciate the arguments Dawkins puts forward against saltationists and punctuationalists, I found them to be repetitive and boring after a while."
51,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/490192-charles,2,"Enchantingly beautiful fiction, 23 Mar 2007  Musings of a fideist (a materialistic fideist). Richard Dawkins has a breathtaking gift for expressive, catchy writing. His handling of illustration and narrative flow like silk. Yet he reminds me of an eloquent 19th century clergyman. His persistent dedication to the high altar of gradualistic explanation, however incredibly improbable, stretches credulity to breaking point. Take for example his extraordinary leap on p.134, para 1, where self-replicating RNA will almost magically come into being - 'all so utterly simple and automatic'. There it is by fiat - Dawkins wishes and so it must be! Abracadabra! Those who have worked in the field know how fasitidious and temperamental RNA and enzymes can be even in the best conditions - yet here it is in rock pool. There are some problems even billions of years won't solve - ask the mathematicians. Or take his extraordinary and uncharacteristically rambling tautology about the peacock's tail, pp 203-206, which boils down to an unexplained discrepancy in tail length (p204) and majority female taste (p205)! This is no cogent defence of evolution of an extraordinarily complex structure, just a mystical will-of-the-wisp-like weaving of concepts to meet his desired end. He reiterates Darwin's acid test of his own theory, on p 91, but if really believed what he wrote there, he would have abandoned neo-Darwinism years ago - I have long since published one very clear example of what he seeks, and his written answer to me was that he couldn't answer it, and there are myriad more. Dawkins is a magician with words, though not as self critical and cautious as he ought to be with scientific argument. "
52,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"I have only ever read one other Dawkins book before, The God Delusion, and really didn't like the style or attitude of the writing, so was not completely looking forward to this one.The primary aim of the book is to look at all the evidence and theories that make up the Darwinian theory of evolution and natural selection. He considers all the evidence from real life examples, in particular the eye, and buy using a computer program that he wrote, demonstrates how new variants of a species can evolve with very simple initial amendments. Later on in the book he looks at how DNA works, the effects of positive feedback on evolution and the way that mutations works of evolution and selection. He also considers the complexity of trying to document the tree of life.Overall I thought this book was a better read than the previous one I had read. Bearing in mind it was written originally in 1986 most of it is still valid, though we now understand far more than we did then. He can get on his high horse quite often, but thankfully not so much in this book."

More people would be convinced watching an episode of Sagan's Cosmos than slugging through this book. I still remember how Cosmos changed the teenage me. Just remember the high-and-mighty all-smiles Sagan! This preacher, one Ricky Dawkins, with his pompous writing, repeating the same phrases, picking fight with other preachers of the same flock (like Reverend Steven J Gould) and offering the worldview that no other beliefs have a sensible place en este mundo may actually repulse a lot of would-be converts.But what I cannot deny is, I am a sucker for this preacher.

I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:“A physicist certainly doesn’t need Darwinism in order to do physics. He might think that biology is a trivial subject compared with physics. It would follow from this that, in his opinion, Darwinism is of trivial importance to science. But he could not sensibly conclude from this that it is therefore false!”Understanding how Darwinian evolution works can change your attitude toward life and self, substantially. What we learned about Darwin at high school is inadequate. This book provides you with simplified biochemistry, biology, math, physics, and reasoning so that you can easily conceive why Darwinism is the most reasonable answer to world's complexity.I would like to quote another part:“In Darwin’s view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of complex adaptations. For what it is worth, it is also the whole point of this book. For Darwin, any evolution that had to be helped over the jumps by God was not evolution at all. It made a nonsense of the central point of evolution. In the light of this, it is easy to see why Darwin constantly reiterated the gradualness of evolution.”This way of thinking is not just confined to the past. Evolutionary-based science is taking over a lot of fields. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University is a leading one. You can find out more at: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/ "
55,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27367650-brian-cloutier,4,"The good part: Dawkins is a great writer. His style is very conversational and the book very quotable. His arguments follow a defined path but still manage to meander through welcome asides. He uses metaphors and thought experiments well, most of the book was very easy to follow.And what arguments he makes! The probability of miracles, potential precursors of RNA, the importance of gradual change. His goal is to show that it's possible to explain the rise of complexity from a simple world and he spectacularly succeeds.However, I'm likely not the intended audience of this book. He spent more time arguing against alternative theories than I would have liked. I had no idea what Mutationism was before he explained it but it sounded dumb within the first few sentences; he didn't need to spend as many pages dismissing it as he did. Same with the entire chapter on Punctuationism. The first few pages went over some really cool notes on speciation and how some large mutations fit into darwinism that the book wouldn't have been complete without. The rest of the chapter tried to defend darwinism from a media I had never paid attention to in the first place.The last third of the book is worth reading because it contains a few insights. But, finishing it is true drudgery and tarnishes my impression of the book as a whole."

When they say: 'nature designed a creature like this and that.', 'it gave them wings' etc. I was thinking: 'What nonsense is this? It's not possible, nature isn't smart to design a complex creature'. But, I was all wrong.Nature doesn't have to be smart to design something. Living beings don't emerge by luck or chance but from necessity. Small and gradual steps make those creatures climb mount improbable, and they happen to look like highly designed creatures.True knowledge not always resides within your gut instincts and common sense. For example, the book explains that if there's a grand designer, it must have been designed too. Therefore, as the book shows, there is no design, only emergence. Only you need to have an open mind to see the truth. Think logically, you will find the truth."

61,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"I should explain the point about the watchmaker. A SMALL ROCKIf you’re walking along in the countryside and you come across a rock, you don’t say, well, where the hell did that come from and who made it? It’s a rock. No one cares. There’s no notices stuck on trees or printed in local free newspapers anywhere saying “have you seen this rock? Description – roughly three inches by four by three; last seen in the Dorchester area; undistinctive grey colouring; answers to the name of “rock”; reward – please call this number; WE MISS YOU ROCK” . It’s a rock. ON THE OTHER HAND, A GOLD WATCHNow, if you saw a beautiful gold watch on your walk in the countryside, you would say – lo! a watch – I deduce that someone has lost a watch and it is here; also, I furthermore deduce that there must be a God.” Richard Dawkins says that watches, or indeed anything complicated, do not infer the existence of a watchmaker. Or, to use a different analogy, a book, which can be a complicated thing, does not infer the existence of an author. You could say well, here’s a book called The Blind Watchmaker and it says it’s by Richard Dawkins, so we see that Richard Dawkins is the author and he wrote this book, but Richard Dawkins would say NO! it doesn’t, have you not been paying attention, have you been giggling and passing notes in the back row again? EVOLUTION OF THE SEMICOLONWhat happened is that gradually, over many billions of years, language formed, inconceivably slowly, for instance it took ten million years for commas to evolve out of a full stop, and another ten million for the exotic semi-colon to evolve out of the comma. So this book The Blind Watchmaker (like all other books) evolved slowly. We have fossils to prove this. They show the missing links. We have, for instance, copies of the book which are called The Blond Watchmaker dating from the Devonian period – it took several millions of years for the Blond to evolve into the Blind, you see. I read that Mexican paleontologists recently unearthed a copy called The Bland Watchmaker. Going back further , we find all sorts of evolutionary byways that, because of natural selection, died out eventually. One manuscript from the late Pleistocene period which is currently on display at the University of East Anglia shows a strange hybrid between an early version of The Blind Watchmaker and Alice in Wonderland in which the famous teaparty scene features a pterodactyl, a plesiosaur (so very unlikely) and a crazed archaeopteryx. This unviable literary form did not survive, as we know. Natural selection, although brutal from our limited human perspective, explains the evolution of complex things. RELIGION CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY TWILIGHT IS POPULARGod cannot explain why the book species “Stephanie Myers” and “Dan Brown”, for instance, proliferate wildly in many varied habitats, whilst arguably more beautiful forms like Henry James, Proust, and the Golden Tamarin dwindle to the point where human intervention from libraries and literary professors are the only thing keeping them from sinking into oblivion – no, God cannot explain this. But Richard Dawkins (also known as ""Science"") can.Sorry, that should be “Richard Dawkins”."
62,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dawkins loves explaining evolutionary theory, and this is one of his best books. My favourite bit is the section on long-tailed birds (peacocks, etc). From the point of view of simple utility, they are rather baffling. What use could you possibly have for that long, stupid tail?But, as Dawkins keeps reminding us, it's not about survival of the species, or even of the individual, but rather of the gene. Suppose there's a sex-linked male gene that disposes towards long tails, and a sex-linked female gene that disposes towards finding long tails attractive. A child born of a union between two individuals carrying these genes will be likely to have both of them. Hence, if it's male, it'll have a long tail, and if it's female it will prefer males with long tails. If this combination becomes common, long-tailed males will have a larger and larger advantage in terms of being preferred by females. Tails will lengthen until the practical downside (being unable to fly, avoid predators, etc) counterbalances the upside of efficiently attracting potential mates.I read this, and suddenly looked at supermodels in a new light. God, they're hot! In fact, if they were any hotter they'd be dead. "
63,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"As the title's extension spells out, this is a definitive (as of '87) rebuttal against all comers in favor of Darwinism, but don't let my saying so prove it. Read it for yourself.All his arguments are crystal clear, but he takes extra time to caricature the caricature of Darwinists, pointing out exactly how the ad absurdum argument really works while also elucidating the fine points of what Darwinism IS versus what it is NOT.He steps us through the first third of the book showing us how Selection works: from an energy standpoint, a competition standpoint, and a sexual standpoint... from the basic building blocks of proteins to more and more complex forms of DNA and the combo cells that collect all the wonderful multicellular creations, including bacteria, that eventually wind up creating us. The descriptions are quite beautiful and clear and all the while, we've got all the foundations for life... without Intelligent Design. The argument is simple, of course. If we can explain everything, and I mean everything that is life and physics, then what purpose does adding a superfluous layer to the explanation serve?This is ten years worth of hate mail for the author, people. He has been beset on all sides with genuinely curious and well-meaning seekers of the god-fearing sort and inundated with screaming lunatics telling him he'll burn in hell for his first book, The Selfish Gene, which, by the way, didn't really give a rat's ass about creationism or the people who support it. It just laid out a very cogent theory that fit all the copious mountains of data in biology. And yet, after that point, a Mr. Dawkins who professes not to want or need a PR team or lawyers, decides to put his foot down and tackle the problem that has reared its muti-angled head in his direction and DEFEND Darwinism.He does so beautifully, I might add. Every step of the way, he defines the complaints with due diligence and proceeds to demolish them sonar-producing batlike grace, with light humor, sharp intellect, and sometimes he makes of his opponents an overzealous meal. Can you blame him? Granted, by this point it's only been a decade of Creationist hate. Give it a decade or a decade and a half more before we see a truly flame worthy attack from Mr.Dawkins. I'm looking forward to seeing some of it in his books. I hope it's there and not just in his interviews which I still haven't seen. Alas.Seriously, though, this book is pretty wonderful for its lucid and quoteworthy passages and vivid descriptions of how Darwinism works, from gene level to the kinds of time-spans that can only be described as geological when it comes to real changes in evolution. I particularly loved the fact that he used computer terminology to describe how our genes are nothing more than complex computers. I've heard this before, of course, but the way he laid it out was particularly enlightening.This stuff is pretty damn great. Just from the science viewpoint, even leaving out the whole defense, it's well worth reading and not nearly as acerbic or rabid as certain other mass-produced troll-attacks make him appear. But then again, I've only read one of his later books, the The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, which was just a charming bi-modal description of science versus magical thinking which also happened to ""gently"" draw people away from having to add that extra layer of explanation to reality. :) I guess I'll see what the other books bring, no?"

This must be the most boring of all Dawkins’ books, but I do not want to give up on him till I read ‘The Extended Phenotype’ which just might prove to be the best (scientifically) of all his works. With whole chapters devoted to the driest taxonomy problems and to disproving outdated theories, the book was a massive waste of time once I went past the mildly interesting first half. But, it still provides an opportunity to use Dawkins’ own method of caricature-based argument to paint a caricature of his own positions in ‘The God Delusion’ based on his own vitriolic stands in this book. I will try to examine in detail how Dawkins has betrayed his own principles of scientific grounding and rational rigorousness in The God Delusion by using arguments and structures from this book in the review.

Of course, I got tired of it after a while (but I had to keep going, because I had to read it for a class). He comes up with many different arguments/theories for how evolution/natural selection could occur, many of which are interesting, but I would just rather read a science book rather than a philosophical book on evolution. For instance, I recommend The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner, which shows how scientists study evolution and natural selection in action. "
68,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Two summers ago, I did myself the favor of reading The Selfish Gene. Well, I didn’t quite read it; rather, I listened to Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, narrate the book, as I took long walks in the forest near my house. Incidentally, I think Dawkins (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lalla) has a magnificent voice; it’s a pleasure to hear him speak.  But that’s a matter of taste; what is not a matter of taste is the quality of that book. Agree or disagree with Dawkins, one must admit that The Selfish Gene is a book of the finest quality. Indeed, I must say that I wasn’t quite prepared for how good it was. I was expecting an entertaining book of popular science; what I got was an eloquent, subtle, and powerful book which managed, in a just a couple weeks of long walks, to completely transform my understanding of animal behavior. This book, The Blind Watchmaker—also listened to in a few long walks—is not of the same caliber. But it is quite good. (Well, if it were written by almost anybody except Dawkins himself, I would say it was very good—but I know the heights he can reach.) I know close to nothing about his advocacy of atheism, and frankly I don’t much care, but I think the public has a rare treasure in Dawkins; what other popular biology writer can compare? Dawkins is, to an almost remarkable extent, as much a philosopher as a scientist. This book, as well as his first, is jammed full of thought experiments; Dawkins simply can’t get enough of them. This emphasis on philosophical argumentation allows him, so to speak, to take the reader inside the logic of Darwinism (as well as inside the fuzzy logic of Darwinism’s opponents). He doesn’t simply tell the reader things biologists think—like a reporter sending dispatches from the front lines—but tries to get the layreader to understand exactly why biologists think what they do. As a result, his books can actually be a bit dense and exhausting; but the patient reader is amply rewarded with a deepened understanding. The main reason that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as his first was that Dawkins spends an awful lot of time dealing with contemporary controversies. This was, I believe, a time of the famed ‘Darwin Wars’, when Gould and his followers had highly publicized debates with team Dawkins. Apparently, reporters were very eager to report anything even slightly critical of Darwinian theory—whether it be from taxonomists, paleontologists, or priests—so Dawkins was forced to spend a lot of time on material that, to today’s reader, may be of limited interest. For example, Dawkins becomes almost pedantic in his chapter on punctuated equilibrium, as he argues again and again that Gould is not a ‘true’ saltationist, but only a modified gradualist. Having read Gould, I was personally interested in this; but I would understand if others were not. Perhaps I was not the book’s target audience, as I needed no convincing that Darwinian evolution is both a well-supported and a powerful theory. Nonetheless, Dawkins did manage to clear up some of evolution’s finer point for me. I was particularly excited when (not to take too much credit) Dawkins confirmed a suspicion that I had expressed a few years back, when I was learning about human evolution. I was actually in Kenya, studying with the Leakeys, who—being the Leakeys—had plastic casts of several dozen important hominin fossils in their lab. As my anatomy teacher enjoyed pointing out, the vast majority of hominin fossils for any given species can fit inside a shoebox. Most of the fossils are distorted, broken, or otherwise fragmentary. Yet from these scant remains, paleoanthropologists expend tremendous energy arguing about the hominin family tree. Is this skull cap Homo erectus or Homo habilis? Is this thigh bone from an early homo or a late autralopithecus? Somewhat exasperated by all this ambiguity—about what appeared to me to be a matter of words—I got an idea: what if the idea of ‘species’ itself breaks down in an evolutionary timescale? After all, if we believe that species change via gradual selection one to another, it follows that there must be individuals intermediate between any two given hominin species, and, furthermore, individuals intermediate between the intermediates—and so on. Eureka! Well, it turns out Dawkins (as well as many other, probably) had the very same idea long before; it appears that convergent evolution is even more prevalent among memes than genes. (As a side note, if one believes, like Gould, in punctuated equilibrium, then ‘species’ would still be valid in an evolutionary timescale. Perhaps this is why the paleoanthropologists are still arguing?) I got sidetracked—back to the book. (Speaking of sidetracked, Dawkins is the master of the interesting aside and the lengthy digression; and, even more impressively, he always manages to tie his asides and digressions neatly back into the main theme under discussion.) Well, I’m afraid I don’t have very much more to say, other than this: if you find yourself with a supply of long walks, and need an audiobook as accompaniment, you might as well download Dawkins’s crisp, dry, whispery voice, and deepen your understanding of the flora and fauna around you—whether it be this book or, if you want a real treat, his first."
69,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd,5,"Dawkins is one of my top picks for the most articulate, engaging and proficient scientists I've read to date. The Blind Watchmaker turned out to be a very prolific piece. I was baffled by his logical analogies, most excellent examples and extremely engaging vernacular. In this work, one learns much about the evolutionary adaptations of numerous species, of which the sonar technology of baths, dolphins and other mammals seemed most shocking.His reasoning of what constitutes miracles, probability theory and reasoning behind the drawback of the Lamark's theory of acquired characteristics is exceptionally enticing. The book should be a required high-school reading. A very, very high recommendation."

Considering the way I was raised - in a heavily religious atmosphere - it was hard for me to accept the theory of evolution. However, Dawkins very clearly lays out the theory in a way that anyone can understand if they are willing to open their mind just a little and put in just a little effort. It might be hard to accept but its even harder to dispute. Reality is like that. I think everyone should be required to read this book. "
71,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins’ outstanding The Selfish Gene, my initial impression of The Blind Watchmaker was a bit of a letdown. Dawkins wrote the book to counter creationist thinking, but for a firm believer in Darwinian evolution, his lengthy arguments were unnecessary. However, if Dawkins converted any creationists, I would consider the book a great success. With that said, there were a number of things I did like. Below are some items that caught my attention.Darwin’s concept of gradual evolution overturned the ideas of the catastrophists, who believed the earth and its creatures were formed by sudden drastic changes. Gradual evolution was then challenged by saltationists who believed large genetic changes or macro-mutations could explain much of evolution. A more refined view is that of Stephen Jay Gould who posited punctuated equilibrium. This view recognized varying rates of change, periods of relative stasis with intervals of rapid modification. Keep in mind rapid was on a geologic time scale where 50,000 years is a short time. Thus Gould’s rapid change could still have evolved step-by-step in line with Darwin. The effect of gradualism that struck me was the notion that speciation is contingent on the demise of intermediate individuals. Otherwise one could not tell where one species began and another ended.An upshot of Dawkins’ idea concerns our own connection with our ancestors. The view of chimpanzees as property is made more acceptable because there are no living intermediaries that show our close relationship. This made me wonder how Neanderthals would be treated if some were found alive. Would they be treated like chimpanzees as a different species? Since they are beings who can successfully interbreed with Homo sapiens, would they be given the same rights? Would Christians consider them as individuals with souls that should be saved? I enjoyed Dawkins explanation of the development of the eye in support of gradualism. The book’s title comes from a pre-Darwin argument that if one found a watch, one would have to assume someone made it. The watch is too intricate to have formed naturally. Post-Darwin, like the watch, some held that the eye was so complex as to defy gradual evolution. Dawkins counters. He takes us from a cell with a light sensitive spot to a creature with several such cells that is helped by this sense of light or dark. Then if the light sensitive cells are recessed, the creature can tell the direction of the shadow. If the recess takes on a cuplike shape, this sense of the light’s direction is enhanced. Next if the walls of the cup build up and protrude partially over the cup, a pinhole camera is formed casting an image on the cup. Then, protecting the cup by extending a membrane over the pinhole forms a lens. And so on…I enjoyed the section on bats and echolocation. Dawkins also offers a reasonable explanation of how this seemingly amazing ability could develop. Dolphins, whales and some birds have independently developed this use of sound showing such development not to be quite as extraordinary as one might think. Dawkins pondering of how bats experience this sense I found fascinating. Do the nerve impulses get mapped by the brain to a model similar to the one we experience as vision? And then there is the fish that senses its environment from disruption to an electrical field – elctrolocation. How is this sense perceived? Another intriguing topic was how sexual selection augments natural selection. Unlike environmental factors which wax and wane in intensity, sexual selection forms a positive feedback loop. A female bird’s preference for long tails in her mate not only promotes the gene for long tails but the gene for the desire for long tails. As both genes proliferate tails will grow longer until a practical limit is reached. The bird still has to be an able flyer to survive. One’s mind quickly turns to how this idea works in humans.This book will mean different things to different readers. Every creationist should read it although I suspect few will. For the rest of us, the book is still worthwhile just to get Dawkins’ unique views on odd and end topics, a few of which I covered. If you get bored reading why creationism is wrong, keep in mind the book is written to be easily read, so you can get through those sections quickly."
72,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"This book is a more nail in the coffin of creationism.It develops the darvinian theory of evolution,change and selection,but at a more deep level than the original Darwins theory,the deeper level of molecular biology and molecular genetics,subjects this unknown in the Darwins time as the quantum electrodinamics was unknown in the Maxwells time but explains at a deeper level the electromagnetic fenomenology.The first chapters explains the incredible aparition of wonderful organs as the human eye as a long series of very small changes and steps as consecuence of mutations by chance each step selected between many others possibles by efficacy and supervivence along unimaginable for the human mind long period of time,millions of years,as the human mind is unable of make a idea of what a light year is in distance.He also explains the deep work of evolution making software models resembling the working of genes.In the mid chapters underlined the mportance of the fact of the cooperation of the genes in the evolution throught the relation with epigenetics and embriology,also explains the concept of punctuated equilibrium as a long standby followed by a fast evolution and it important role in the peciation and the existence of molecular clocks for measuring times and distances in evolutionary processes.In the final chapters confronts the different schools of taxonomy in clasifyng species and discuss the other failed schools of explanation of the origen of the species : creationism,saltationism,Lamarckism ( inherited features ) and some other.A excelent book in giving another perspetive of darvinian evolution,full of subtle concepts and reasonings that dismantle the creationism and other wrong theories."

The author is very aggressive in convincing the reader in evolution by means of cumulative natural selection compare to all the other beliefs (natural selection in one step, creationist, etc.)I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Slepi Časovničar autora Ričarda Dokinsa Heliks 2010 publishing / 496 pages / 133,407 words."
74,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"...one of my aims in the book is to convey something of the sheer wonder of biological complexity to those whose eyes have not been opened to it. But having built up the mystery, my other main aim is to remove it again by explaining the solution...He managed the above, but I didn't enjoy this as much as The Selfish Gene or The God Delusion. It delves deeper & wanders around Darwinian Evolution & other theories more than I want or need. I hadn't planned to read this since I understood this from his updated edition of The Selfish Gene, but I found it cheap & needed to bump my Amazon order a bit for free shipping. I'm glad I did.My interest varied & I don't think I would have gotten through a text version without a lot of skimming. He addresses issues/controversies in great detail that I didn't know existed nor was I particularly interested in them, so I found the long refutation boring. Often he digressed to build the knowledge & logic which proves why the other theory or claim is wrong. I find about half of these wanderings interesting, while some just beat the particular subject to death. He starts the preface with the following:This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet...So, I was easily able to finish it & even wanted more due to the wonderful narration &, for all that my interest flagged occasionally, there was plenty of fascinating material. That's incredible in light of the age of this book. Quite a few of the science books & articles I've read that were half as old were terribly dated, but Dawkins is dealing with the theory itself, how genetic change & natural selection works over long time periods to build complex systems, instead of details which may have been superseded as technology runs on. Some of the best parts are his opinions of other scientists. He's very fast to give credit to others where it is due. He touts other books & scientists as better or more thorough on some points while he is obviously incensed at a few. At one point, he finished a particularly scathing denunciation & said perhaps he should go out & dig up the garden. He didn't try for a lot of humor, but when it popped up like that it was great. Even when he's peeved, he is polite & gives them their due, though.His ability to simplify & make sense of large numbers & statistical probability is absolutely masterful. It was great to be able to fiddle with the biomorph program. A search for ""Biomorph Breeder Program"" brings up several interesting ones similar to those Dawkins wrote & used. I understood Dawkins' explanations just fine, but actually playing with the program is really worth it. The extreme effects of random change over time are amazing. He's right, we aren't equipped to really understand large numbers or long times, the obvious problem with Young Earth Creationists' beliefs. Of course, those I know somehow make intentional ignorance & a belief in magic a positive attribute. I find their intellectual dishonesty infuriating, especially so when they try to foist them on me, especially in matters of public policy. (Beliefs should remain private. Public discourse requires facts & logic or there can be no reasoning with each other.)One thing I really missed was an explanation of what a species is. (Does he address speciation in The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene?) For years I thought the criterion was simply the ability to breed with the result of fertile offspring. Then I read this article:https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/08...IOW, I was certain in my ignorance & now that I know more, I'm unsure & somewhat bewildered - a good thing from a scientific point of view, but the lack weakened his arguments a bit for me simply because I spent too much time wondering about it. Still, it had no real bearing on his argument even in the chapter on taxonomy. I had no idea taxonomists disagreed so much. I thought I was the only person who made such a muddle of filing. I loved Dawkins' comparisons to library science. It really made a lot more sense of clades & the various other organization schemes.Table of ContentsChapter I: Explaining the very improbableChapter 2: Good designChapter 3: Accumulating small changeChapter 4: Making tracks through animal spaceChapter 5: The power and the archivesChapter 6: Origins and miraclesChapter 7: Constructive evolutionChapter 8: Explosions and spiralsChapter 9: Puncturing punctuationismChapter 10: The one true tree of lifeChapter 11: Doomed rivalsIt was an excellent read & I'll be referring to parts of it the rest of my life.

A truly gifted educator."
75,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Analyzes all the various flavors of Darwinist evolution and some competing theoriesRichard Dawkins is a very lucid and intelligent proponent of evolutionary theory and biology when he isn't getting into vitriolic debates with Creationists, which is an exercise in futility for both sides I'd say. I admire him for trying, but frankly trying to use logic and scientific reasoning with people who think the world is 6,000 years old, was created by an all-powerful being who somehow still tolerates Donald Trump's existence, explain the fossil record and dinosaurs as just tests of faith, and really think the universe is centered around planet Earth is truly a tase of time.So it's good to listen to a book that focuses on evolution, but as this book explores some of the subtle variants of evolutionary theory, like gradualists vs punctuationalists, dismantles Lamarkism and Lysenko, it feels a bit turgid at times, and I thought his much later book The Greatest Show on Earth was more interesting and focused on explaining what non-random natural selection means rather than debunking some other ""weak"" theories."
76,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Here are some key points I gathered from this wonderful wonderful book:- According to Dawkins, Darwinism seems to be more in need of advocacy than other branches of science. For instance, many people have no grasp of quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make them oppose the theory as nonsense. This could have religious implications.- One big problem with Darwinism is that everybody thinks he understands it.- The main reason why most people disbelieve Darwinism is that our brains are built to deal with events on radically different timescales from those that characterize evolutionary change. We have no difficulty visualizing processes that take seconds, minutes, years and decades at most to complete, whereas evolutionary change transpires in millions or hundreds of millions of years. - Man-made artifacts like computers and cars are obviously designed for a purpose, yet they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic rather than of flesh and blood. We are designed on a drawing board too, but were our parts assembled by a skilled engineer? the answer is no. When Charles Darwin first explained the matter, many people either wouldn't or couldn't grasp it.- This book is a rebuttal to William Paley's book (Which I have not read yet) called ""natural theology"". In this book which was lauded by Darwin and Dawkins as an inspiring book at the time, Paley uses the analogy of a watch you find in the middle of a road. Upon seeing such a complex apparatus (think of all the cogs and springs and things used in a watch to make it work), you immediately realize that it must be the product of some intelligent design. It makes no sense to declare it just happened to lie there higgledy-piggledy by mere chance or accident. According to Paley a human organ like an eye is much more complex than a watch, therefore like the watch which requires a watchmaker, the eye requires a designer, or does it?- According to Dawkins, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics. Natural selection is the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered. - Natural selection does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight. It can be said to play the role of the watchmaker in nature, but it's the blind watchmaker and hence the title of this book.- Evidence for evolution is overwhelming, in fact it is so overwhelming that even most theologians have given up believing in instantaneous creation. Nevertheless, many of these theologians have tried to smuggle God in by the back door, so to speak, and they allow him some sort of supervisory role over the course that evolution has taken. Dawkins rightly asserts that we cannot disprove beliefs like these. Be that as it may, there are some problems with these beliefs. Firstly, that they are superfluous and, secondly, that they assume the existence of the main thing we want to explain, namely organized complexity. If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guided evolution, that deity must have already been vastly complex in the first place. * This book is a must-read and highly recommended for anyone who is curious about nature. There are many things I learned like idea of arms races, or what mutations are and what's random and nonrandom and so much more. "
77,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"Some parts of the book are quite intriguing while a few chapters carry some ponderousness, leaving me in a bewilderment of what Dawkins intends to convey .Just put aside the evolutionary theory and natural selection and find something amusing. In the female birds' preference for a long tail section, it seems the female birds were in a dominant position in choosing what kind of male birds she likes, be they long tails or short tails. This reminds me of a hilarious essay of James Thurber which he wrote for The New Yorker in 1939 called Courtship Through the Ages.""Surely nothing in the astonishing scheme of life can have nonplused Nature so much as the fact that none of the females of any of the species she created really cared very much for the male, as such. For the past ten million years Nature has been busily inventing ways to make the male attractive to the female, but the whole business of courtship, from the marine annelids up to man, still lumbers heavily along, like a complicated musical comedy. I have been reading the sad and absorbing story in Volume 6 (Cole to Dama) of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In this volume you can learn about cricket, cotton, costume designing, crocodiles, crown jewels, and Coleridge, but none of this subject is so interesting as the Courtship of animals, which recounts the sorrowful lengths to which all males must go to arouse the interest of a lady.” I don't know why this essay suddenly occurred to me but I confess it is Quite an amusing story to read."
78,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"One of the best and most understandable arguments for evolutionary theory and natural selection Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.In the spirit of Darwin, Dawkins argues soundly, comprehensively, in this form of a non-fiction book rhetorically above average and merely correct. In contrast to his later work ""The God Delusion,"" which is so full of polemics, he refrains from doing so. He endeavors to provide factual and scientifically sound reasoning. Thus he celebrates the breathtaking emergence of highly sophisticated systems such as the human body with the apparent enthusiasm of an evolutionary biologist, who burns for his profession and also does not hesitate to lead various theses against the theory of evolution in the field. Mind you only around, to feed his lines, then enjoyable to dismantle piece by piece and to intone on their ruins a song of praise to the fantastic, developmental severe history of life. Ironically, the title of the work also refers to a book by the creationist pioneer William Paley, who wanted to use God in the form of a watchmaker to depict the ""production"" of all worldly components. Understandably, Dawkins could not resist alienating this clear image of his natural adversary for his purposes and turning the chronograph maker into an unconscious, a meaningless and blind metaphor for natural selection. As an illustration, object to be drawn through the book, the human eye was chosen. Its origins, shapes, and history of development make the reader pause in astonishment with fascinating insights into out of which amazing creatures our windows to the world have watched world eons of years ago.As long as Dawkins lingers in his field of study, the soundness of his lines of reasoning can hardly be counteracted, and until nowadays, this literature, which was published in 1986, cannot be compared with the writing of equal value. Unfortunately, an inappropriate and meanwhile more than obsolete attempt to show a kind of evolution based on the development of computer technology is to be found among the examples. This is a well-intentioned approach, to make the own theses seem even more comprehensive and to use artificial adaptations in as many subjects as possible to provide evidence. However, as in this case, it inevitably fails because of the dry basis and comprehensibility of the theses, which are too constructed and, funny enough, very much reminiscent of the custom of religious fanatics. These try to bend over and put a concept on everything. Also, the all specific too, rather short inserts on medicine and genetics are correct, but in contrast to the rest of the book exhausting to read. One notices that the actual primary operating field is left shortly. In general, the work would do a small renovation in the direction of the current state of research very well, so that the critical minds of the 21st century to have both well-founded and current reasoning for the hopefully eventually ended, meaningless dispute with ignorant people. Despite the small points of criticism an epochal work that seeks its equal in its timeless correctness and the significant, underlying concerns of the Enlightenment. It testifies to the enthusiasm to which professional occupation with the miracle of the creation of life can become. A fortunate coincidence, too, when this gift falls into the hands of a talented narrative man whose tactical acumen dictates that he should not encourage the prevention of water on the mills of his opponents. By withdrawing any basis of existence on a purely factual basis of any religious embarrassment, creation myth, and Genesis. Now the hard facts only have to flow into the consciousness of the people. Dropwise and very slowly. Sticky droplets.Eine der besten und verständlichsten Argumentationsführungen für Evolutionstheorie und natürliche SelektionGanz im Sinne Darwins argumentiert Dawkins stichhaltig, umfassend, in dieser Form für ein Sachbuch rhetorisch überdurchschnittlich gut und schlichtweg richtig. Er hält sich dabei im Gegensatz zu seinem späteren Werk Gotteswahn, das vor Polemik nur so strotzt, zurück. Er ist bemüht, eine sachliche und wissenschaftlich fundierte Argumentation abzuliefern. So feiert er die die atemberaubende Entstehung höchst diffiziler Systeme wie dem menschlichen Körper mit der spürbaren Begeisterung eines Evolutionsbiologen, der für sein Metier brennt und auch nicht davor zurückschreckt, verschiedenste Thesen gegen die Evolutionstheorie ins Feld zu führen. Wohlgemerkt nur um, sich selbst geschickt den Ball zuspielend, sie anschließend genussvoll Stück für Stück zu demontieren und auf ihren Trümmern ein Loblied auf die erstaunliche, seriöse Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebens anzustimmen.Ironisch ist auch der Titel des Werks zu verstehen, der sich auf ein Buch des kreationistischen Vordenkers William Paley bezieht, der anhand Gottes in Form eines Uhrmachers die „Fertigung“ sämtlicher weltlicher Bestandteile darstellen wollte. Verständlich, dass Dawkins nicht widerstehen konnte, dieses krasse Bild seines natürlichen Gegners für eigene Zwecke zu entfremden und aus dem Chronographenhersteller eine unbewusst, ohne Sinn und blind arbeitende Metapher für die natürliche Selektion zu machen.Als ein sich durch das Buch ziehendes Veranschaulichungsobjekt wurde das menschliche Auge gewählt. Dessen Ursprung, Formen und Entwicklungsgeschichte lassen mit den faszinierenden Erkenntnissen, aus welch unerwarteten Kreaturen unsere Fenster zur Welt vor Äonen von Jahren geblickt haben, den Leser vor Erstaunen innehalten. Solange Dawkins in seinem Fachbereich verweilt ist der Stichhaltigkeit seiner Argumentationsketten kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen und man kann diesem 1986 erschienen Werk bis heute wenig gleichwertige Literatur zur Seite stellen. Leider ist auch ein unpassender und mittlerweile mehr als nur veralteter Versuch, anhand der Entwicklung der Computertechnik eine Art von Evolution aufzeigen zu wollen, unter den Beispielen. Das ist ein gut gemeinter Ansatz, die eigenen Thesen noch umfassender erscheinen zu lassen und künstliche Adaptionen in möglichst vielen Themenkreisen zur Erbringung von Belegen heranzuziehen. Es scheitert aber, wie in diesem Fall, zwangsläufig an der unzureichenden Basis und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Thesen, die allzu konstruiert sind und lustigerweise sehr an den Usus der religiösen Fanatiker erinnern. Diese versuchen auch auf Biegen und Brechen ein Konzept über alles zu stülpen.Auch sind die allzu fachspezifisch ausgeführten, eher kurzen Einschübe über Medizin und Genetik zwar richtig, aber im Kontrast zum Rest des Buches anstrengend zu lesen. Man merkt, dass das eigentliche Hauptbetätigungsfeld kurzfristig verlassen wird. Generell täte dem Werk eine kleine Renovierung in Richtung des aktuellen Standes der Forschung sehr gut, damit auch die kritischen Geister des 21. Jahrhunderts sowohl wohlfundierte als auch aktuelle Argumentationen für den hoffentlich irgendwann beendeten, sinnbefreiten Disput mit ignoranten Mitmenschen haben.Trotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte eine epochales Werk, dass in seiner zeitlosen Richtigkeit und dem hehren, dahinterstehenden Anliegen der Aufklärung seinesgleichen sucht. Es zeugt von der Begeisterungsfähigkeit, zu der die berufliche Beschäftigung mit dem Wunder der Entstehung des Lebens werden kann. Ein glücklicher Zufall auch, wenn diese Gabe in die Hände eines noch dazu erzählerisch talentierten Mannes fällt, dessen taktischer Scharfsinn ihm gebietet, der Prävention des Wassers auf die Mühlen seiner Gegner keinen Vorschub zu leisten. Indem er auf einer rein sachlichen Basis jeglicher Art von religiöser Verbrämung, Schöpfungsmythos und Entstehungsmären jegliche Existenzgrundlage entzieht. Jetzt müssen die harten Fakten nur noch ins Bewusstsein der Menschen einfließen. Tröpfchenweise und sehr langsam. Klebrige Tröpfchen."
79,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,5,"The Blind Watchmaker is probably one of the best introductory books on evolution.Dawkins takes his time, explaining step by step how Darwinian evolution works.Dawkins explains at great length, how species that look like a ""complex design"" evolve with accumulating small changes via natural selection, why natural selection is ""blind""; ie. it lacks purpose, how random mutations combined with non-random natural selection is necessary for evolution to take place, and why a ""complex design"" does not necessarily mean a ""good design"" (such as ganglion cells which make the electronic wiring interface between the photocells and the brain, face light directly, whereas photocells sit away from the light source in human eye; compared to octopus eye that has photocells facing the light source).Then the structure of genetic blueprint (DNA) is explained; how DNA archives are being copied from cell to cell and from individual to individual, how copy errors are made, and how mutations can occur.In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity of pure randomness as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the Weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.If you are curious about evolution and choose the best introductory book on the subject this is the one."
80,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I enjoyed this book very much, despite the difficulty of reading the very small typeface. Dawkins' style is almost folksy, and not at all the arrogant, condescending style that some reviewers mention. The first chapter, about echolocation in bats, is fascinating. I also enjoyed reading about the different philosophies involved in taxonomy, the classification of species. Some reviewers mention that Dawkins' explanations are ""old hat"", and that the computer simulations are primitive; but they do need to keep in mind that the book is already 25 years old! While I do appreciate the arguments Dawkins puts forward against saltationists and punctuationalists, I found them to be repetitive and boring after a while."
81,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/490192-charles,2,"Enchantingly beautiful fiction, 23 Mar 2007  Musings of a fideist (a materialistic fideist). Richard Dawkins has a breathtaking gift for expressive, catchy writing. His handling of illustration and narrative flow like silk. Yet he reminds me of an eloquent 19th century clergyman. His persistent dedication to the high altar of gradualistic explanation, however incredibly improbable, stretches credulity to breaking point. Take for example his extraordinary leap on p.134, para 1, where self-replicating RNA will almost magically come into being - 'all so utterly simple and automatic'. There it is by fiat - Dawkins wishes and so it must be! Abracadabra! Those who have worked in the field know how fasitidious and temperamental RNA and enzymes can be even in the best conditions - yet here it is in rock pool. There are some problems even billions of years won't solve - ask the mathematicians. Or take his extraordinary and uncharacteristically rambling tautology about the peacock's tail, pp 203-206, which boils down to an unexplained discrepancy in tail length (p204) and majority female taste (p205)! This is no cogent defence of evolution of an extraordinarily complex structure, just a mystical will-of-the-wisp-like weaving of concepts to meet his desired end. He reiterates Darwin's acid test of his own theory, on p 91, but if really believed what he wrote there, he would have abandoned neo-Darwinism years ago - I have long since published one very clear example of what he seeks, and his written answer to me was that he couldn't answer it, and there are myriad more. Dawkins is a magician with words, though not as self critical and cautious as he ought to be with scientific argument. "
82,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"I have only ever read one other Dawkins book before, The God Delusion, and really didn't like the style or attitude of the writing, so was not completely looking forward to this one.The primary aim of the book is to look at all the evidence and theories that make up the Darwinian theory of evolution and natural selection. He considers all the evidence from real life examples, in particular the eye, and buy using a computer program that he wrote, demonstrates how new variants of a species can evolve with very simple initial amendments. Later on in the book he looks at how DNA works, the effects of positive feedback on evolution and the way that mutations works of evolution and selection. He also considers the complexity of trying to document the tree of life.Overall I thought this book was a better read than the previous one I had read. Bearing in mind it was written originally in 1986 most of it is still valid, though we now understand far more than we did then. He can get on his high horse quite often, but thankfully not so much in this book."

More people would be convinced watching an episode of Sagan's Cosmos than slugging through this book. I still remember how Cosmos changed the teenage me. Just remember the high-and-mighty all-smiles Sagan! This preacher, one Ricky Dawkins, with his pompous writing, repeating the same phrases, picking fight with other preachers of the same flock (like Reverend Steven J Gould) and offering the worldview that no other beliefs have a sensible place en este mundo may actually repulse a lot of would-be converts.But what I cannot deny is, I am a sucker for this preacher. Through and through."

I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:“A physicist certainly doesn’t need Darwinism in order to do physics. He might think that biology is a trivial subject compared with physics. It would follow from this that, in his opinion, Darwinism is of trivial importance to science. But he could not sensibly conclude from this that it is therefore false!”Understanding how Darwinian evolution works can change your attitude toward life and self, substantially. What we learned about Darwin at high school is inadequate. This book provides you with simplified biochemistry, biology, math, physics, and reasoning so that you can easily conceive why Darwinism is the most reasonable answer to world's complexity.I would like to quote another part:“In Darwin’s view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of complex adaptations. For what it is worth, it is also the whole point of this book. For Darwin, any evolution that had to be helped over the jumps by God was not evolution at all. It made a nonsense of the central point of evolution. In the light of this, it is easy to see why Darwin constantly reiterated the gradualness of evolution.”This way of thinking is not just confined to the past. Evolutionary-based science is taking over a lot of fields. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University is a leading one. You can find out more at: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/ "
85,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27367650-brian-cloutier,4,"The good part: Dawkins is a great writer. His style is very conversational and the book very quotable. His arguments follow a defined path but still manage to meander through welcome asides. He uses metaphors and thought experiments well, most of the book was very easy to follow.And what arguments he makes! The probability of miracles, potential precursors of RNA, the importance of gradual change. His goal is to show that it's possible to explain the rise of complexity from a simple world and he spectacularly succeeds.However, I'm likely not the intended audience of this book. He spent more time arguing against alternative theories than I would have liked. I had no idea what Mutationism was before he explained it but it sounded dumb within the first few sentences; he didn't need to spend as many pages dismissing it as he did. Same with the entire chapter on Punctuationism. The first few pages went over some really cool notes on speciation and how some large mutations fit into darwinism that the book wouldn't have been complete without. The rest of the chapter tried to defend darwinism from a media I had never paid attention to in the first place.The last third of the book is worth reading because it contains a few insights. But, finishing it is true drudgery and tarnishes my impression of the book as a whole."

When they say: 'nature designed a creature like this and that.', 'it gave them wings' etc. I was thinking: 'What nonsense is this? It's not possible, nature isn't smart to design a complex creature'. But, I was all wrong.Nature doesn't have to be smart to design something. Living beings don't emerge by luck or chance but from necessity. Small and gradual steps make those creatures climb mount improbable, and they happen to look like highly designed creatures.True knowledge not always resides within your gut instincts and common sense. For example, the book explains that if there's a grand designer, it must have been designed too. Therefore, as the book shows, there is no design, only emergence. Only you need to have an open mind to see the truth. Think logically, you will find the truth."

91,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"I should explain the point about the watchmaker. A SMALL ROCKIf you’re walking along in the countryside and you come across a rock, you don’t say, well, where the hell did that come from and who made it? It’s a rock. No one cares. There’s no notices stuck on trees or printed in local free newspapers anywhere saying “have you seen this rock? Description – roughly three inches by four by three; last seen in the Dorchester area; undistinctive grey colouring; answers to the name of “rock”; reward – please call this number; WE MISS YOU ROCK” . It’s a rock. ON THE OTHER HAND, A GOLD WATCHNow, if you saw a beautiful gold watch on your walk in the countryside, you would say – lo! a watch – I deduce that someone has lost a watch and it is here; also, I furthermore deduce that there must be a God.” Richard Dawkins says that watches, or indeed anything complicated, do not infer the existence of a watchmaker. Or, to use a different analogy, a book, which can be a complicated thing, does not infer the existence of an author. You could say well, here’s a book called The Blind Watchmaker and it says it’s by Richard Dawkins, so we see that Richard Dawkins is the author and he wrote this book, but Richard Dawkins would say NO! it doesn’t, have you not been paying attention, have you been giggling and passing notes in the back row again? EVOLUTION OF THE SEMICOLONWhat happened is that gradually, over many billions of years, language formed, inconceivably slowly, for instance it took ten million years for commas to evolve out of a full stop, and another ten million for the exotic semi-colon to evolve out of the comma. So this book The Blind Watchmaker (like all other books) evolved slowly. We have fossils to prove this. They show the missing links. We have, for instance, copies of the book which are called The Blond Watchmaker dating from the Devonian period – it took several millions of years for the Blond to evolve into the Blind, you see. I read that Mexican paleontologists recently unearthed a copy called The Bland Watchmaker. Going back further , we find all sorts of evolutionary byways that, because of natural selection, died out eventually. One manuscript from the late Pleistocene period which is currently on display at the University of East Anglia shows a strange hybrid between an early version of The Blind Watchmaker and Alice in Wonderland in which the famous teaparty scene features a pterodactyl, a plesiosaur (so very unlikely) and a crazed archaeopteryx. This unviable literary form did not survive, as we know. Natural selection, although brutal from our limited human perspective, explains the evolution of complex things. RELIGION CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY TWILIGHT IS POPULARGod cannot explain why the book species “Stephanie Myers” and “Dan Brown”, for instance, proliferate wildly in many varied habitats, whilst arguably more beautiful forms like Henry James, Proust, and the Golden Tamarin dwindle to the point where human intervention from libraries and literary professors are the only thing keeping them from sinking into oblivion – no, God cannot explain this. But Richard Dawkins (also known as ""Science"") can.Sorry, that should be “Richard Dawkins”."
92,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dawkins loves explaining evolutionary theory, and this is one of his best books. My favourite bit is the section on long-tailed birds (peacocks, etc). From the point of view of simple utility, they are rather baffling. What use could you possibly have for that long, stupid tail?But, as Dawkins keeps reminding us, it's not about survival of the species, or even of the individual, but rather of the gene. Suppose there's a sex-linked male gene that disposes towards long tails, and a sex-linked female gene that disposes towards finding long tails attractive. A child born of a union between two individuals carrying these genes will be likely to have both of them. Hence, if it's male, it'll have a long tail, and if it's female it will prefer males with long tails. If this combination becomes common, long-tailed males will have a larger and larger advantage in terms of being preferred by females. Tails will lengthen until the practical downside (being unable to fly, avoid predators, etc) counterbalances the upside of efficiently attracting potential mates.I read this, and suddenly looked at supermodels in a new light. God, they're hot! In fact, if they were any hotter they'd be dead. "
93,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"As the title's extension spells out, this is a definitive (as of '87) rebuttal against all comers in favor of Darwinism, but don't let my saying so prove it. Read it for yourself.All his arguments are crystal clear, but he takes extra time to caricature the caricature of Darwinists, pointing out exactly how the ad absurdum argument really works while also elucidating the fine points of what Darwinism IS versus what it is NOT.He steps us through the first third of the book showing us how Selection works: from an energy standpoint, a competition standpoint, and a sexual standpoint... from the basic building blocks of proteins to more and more complex forms of DNA and the combo cells that collect all the wonderful multicellular creations, including bacteria, that eventually wind up creating us. The descriptions are quite beautiful and clear and all the while, we've got all the foundations for life... without Intelligent Design. The argument is simple, of course. If we can explain everything, and I mean everything that is life and physics, then what purpose does adding a superfluous layer to the explanation serve?This is ten years worth of hate mail for the author, people. He has been beset on all sides with genuinely curious and well-meaning seekers of the god-fearing sort and inundated with screaming lunatics telling him he'll burn in hell for his first book, The Selfish Gene, which, by the way, didn't really give a rat's ass about creationism or the people who support it. It just laid out a very cogent theory that fit all the copious mountains of data in biology. And yet, after that point, a Mr. Dawkins who professes not to want or need a PR team or lawyers, decides to put his foot down and tackle the problem that has reared its muti-angled head in his direction and DEFEND Darwinism.He does so beautifully, I might add. Every step of the way, he defines the complaints with due diligence and proceeds to demolish them sonar-producing batlike grace, with light humor, sharp intellect, and sometimes he makes of his opponents an overzealous meal. Can you blame him? Granted, by this point it's only been a decade of Creationist hate. Give it a decade or a decade and a half more before we see a truly flame worthy attack from Mr.Dawkins. I'm looking forward to seeing some of it in his books. I hope it's there and not just in his interviews which I still haven't seen. Alas.Seriously, though, this book is pretty wonderful for its lucid and quoteworthy passages and vivid descriptions of how Darwinism works, from gene level to the kinds of time-spans that can only be described as geological when it comes to real changes in evolution. I particularly loved the fact that he used computer terminology to describe how our genes are nothing more than complex computers. I've heard this before, of course, but the way he laid it out was particularly enlightening.This stuff is pretty damn great. Just from the science viewpoint, even leaving out the whole defense, it's well worth reading and not nearly as acerbic or rabid as certain other mass-produced troll-attacks make him appear. But then again, I've only read one of his later books, the The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, which was just a charming bi-modal description of science versus magical thinking which also happened to ""gently"" draw people away from having to add that extra layer of explanation to reality. :) I guess I'll see what the other books bring, no?"

Of course, he turned out to be more accurate than he must have wished for. This must be the most boring of all Dawkins’ books, but I do not want to give up on him till I read ‘The Extended Phenotype’ which just might prove to be the best (scientifically) of all his works. With whole chapters devoted to the driest taxonomy problems and to disproving outdated theories, the book was a massive waste of time once I went past the mildly interesting first half. But, it still provides an opportunity to use Dawkins’ own method of caricature-based argument to paint a caricature of his own positions in ‘The God Delusion’ based on his own vitriolic stands in this book. I will try to examine in detail how Dawkins has betrayed his own principles of scientific grounding and rational rigorousness in The God Delusion by using arguments and structures from this book in the review.

Of course, I got tired of it after a while (but I had to keep going, because I had to read it for a class). He comes up with many different arguments/theories for how evolution/natural selection could occur, many of which are interesting, but I would just rather read a science book rather than a philosophical book on evolution. For instance, I recommend The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner, which shows how scientists study evolution and natural selection in action. "
98,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Two summers ago, I did myself the favor of reading The Selfish Gene. Well, I didn’t quite read it; rather, I listened to Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, narrate the book, as I took long walks in the forest near my house. Incidentally, I think Dawkins (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lalla) has a magnificent voice; it’s a pleasure to hear him speak.  But that’s a matter of taste; what is not a matter of taste is the quality of that book. Agree or disagree with Dawkins, one must admit that The Selfish Gene is a book of the finest quality. Indeed, I must say that I wasn’t quite prepared for how good it was. I was expecting an entertaining book of popular science; what I got was an eloquent, subtle, and powerful book which managed, in a just a couple weeks of long walks, to completely transform my understanding of animal behavior. This book, The Blind Watchmaker—also listened to in a few long walks—is not of the same caliber. But it is quite good. (Well, if it were written by almost anybody except Dawkins himself, I would say it was very good—but I know the heights he can reach.) I know close to nothing about his advocacy of atheism, and frankly I don’t much care, but I think the public has a rare treasure in Dawkins; what other popular biology writer can compare? Dawkins is, to an almost remarkable extent, as much a philosopher as a scientist. This book, as well as his first, is jammed full of thought experiments; Dawkins simply can’t get enough of them. This emphasis on philosophical argumentation allows him, so to speak, to take the reader inside the logic of Darwinism (as well as inside the fuzzy logic of Darwinism’s opponents). He doesn’t simply tell the reader things biologists think—like a reporter sending dispatches from the front lines—but tries to get the layreader to understand exactly why biologists think what they do. As a result, his books can actually be a bit dense and exhausting; but the patient reader is amply rewarded with a deepened understanding. The main reason that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as his first was that Dawkins spends an awful lot of time dealing with contemporary controversies. This was, I believe, a time of the famed ‘Darwin Wars’, when Gould and his followers had highly publicized debates with team Dawkins. Apparently, reporters were very eager to report anything even slightly critical of Darwinian theory—whether it be from taxonomists, paleontologists, or priests—so Dawkins was forced to spend a lot of time on material that, to today’s reader, may be of limited interest. For example, Dawkins becomes almost pedantic in his chapter on punctuated equilibrium, as he argues again and again that Gould is not a ‘true’ saltationist, but only a modified gradualist. Having read Gould, I was personally interested in this; but I would understand if others were not. Perhaps I was not the book’s target audience, as I needed no convincing that Darwinian evolution is both a well-supported and a powerful theory. Nonetheless, Dawkins did manage to clear up some of evolution’s finer point for me. I was particularly excited when (not to take too much credit) Dawkins confirmed a suspicion that I had expressed a few years back, when I was learning about human evolution. I was actually in Kenya, studying with the Leakeys, who—being the Leakeys—had plastic casts of several dozen important hominin fossils in their lab. As my anatomy teacher enjoyed pointing out, the vast majority of hominin fossils for any given species can fit inside a shoebox. Most of the fossils are distorted, broken, or otherwise fragmentary. Yet from these scant remains, paleoanthropologists expend tremendous energy arguing about the hominin family tree. Is this skull cap Homo erectus or Homo habilis? Is this thigh bone from an early homo or a late autralopithecus? Somewhat exasperated by all this ambiguity—about what appeared to me to be a matter of words—I got an idea: what if the idea of ‘species’ itself breaks down in an evolutionary timescale? After all, if we believe that species change via gradual selection one to another, it follows that there must be individuals intermediate between any two given hominin species, and, furthermore, individuals intermediate between the intermediates—and so on. Eureka! Well, it turns out Dawkins (as well as many other, probably) had the very same idea long before; it appears that convergent evolution is even more prevalent among memes than genes. (As a side note, if one believes, like Gould, in punctuated equilibrium, then ‘species’ would still be valid in an evolutionary timescale. Perhaps this is why the paleoanthropologists are still arguing?) I got sidetracked—back to the book. (Speaking of sidetracked, Dawkins is the master of the interesting aside and the lengthy digression; and, even more impressively, he always manages to tie his asides and digressions neatly back into the main theme under discussion.) Well, I’m afraid I don’t have very much more to say, other than this: if you find yourself with a supply of long walks, and need an audiobook as accompaniment, you might as well download Dawkins’s crisp, dry, whispery voice, and deepen your understanding of the flora and fauna around you—whether it be this book or, if you want a real treat, his first."
99,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd,5,"Dawkins is one of my top picks for the most articulate, engaging and proficient scientists I've read to date. The Blind Watchmaker turned out to be a very prolific piece. I was baffled by his logical analogies, most excellent examples and extremely engaging vernacular. In this work, one learns much about the evolutionary adaptations of numerous species, of which the sonar technology of baths, dolphins and other mammals seemed most shocking.His reasoning of what constitutes miracles, probability theory and reasoning behind the drawback of the Lamark's theory of acquired characteristics is exceptionally enticing. The book should be a required high-school reading. A very, very high recommendation."
100,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7503511-seth-hanson,4,"At the time, this was a tough book for me to read. Considering the way I was raised - in a heavily religious atmosphere - it was hard for me to accept the theory of evolution. However, Dawkins very clearly lays out the theory in a way that anyone can understand if they are willing to open their mind just a little and put in just a little effort. It might be hard to accept but its even harder to dispute. Reality is like that. I think everyone should be required to read this book. "
101,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins’ outstanding The Selfish Gene, my initial impression of The Blind Watchmaker was a bit of a letdown. Dawkins wrote the book to counter creationist thinking, but for a firm believer in Darwinian evolution, his lengthy arguments were unnecessary. However, if Dawkins converted any creationists, I would consider the book a great success. With that said, there were a number of things I did like. Below are some items that caught my attention.Darwin’s concept of gradual evolution overturned the ideas of the catastrophists, who believed the earth and its creatures were formed by sudden drastic changes. Gradual evolution was then challenged by saltationists who believed large genetic changes or macro-mutations could explain much of evolution. A more refined view is that of Stephen Jay Gould who posited punctuated equilibrium. This view recognized varying rates of change, periods of relative stasis with intervals of rapid modification. Keep in mind rapid was on a geologic time scale where 50,000 years is a short time. Thus Gould’s rapid change could still have evolved step-by-step in line with Darwin. The effect of gradualism that struck me was the notion that speciation is contingent on the demise of intermediate individuals. Otherwise one could not tell where one species began and another ended.An upshot of Dawkins’ idea concerns our own connection with our ancestors. The view of chimpanzees as property is made more acceptable because there are no living intermediaries that show our close relationship. This made me wonder how Neanderthals would be treated if some were found alive. Would they be treated like chimpanzees as a different species? Since they are beings who can successfully interbreed with Homo sapiens, would they be given the same rights? Would Christians consider them as individuals with souls that should be saved? I enjoyed Dawkins explanation of the development of the eye in support of gradualism. The book’s title comes from a pre-Darwin argument that if one found a watch, one would have to assume someone made it. The watch is too intricate to have formed naturally. Post-Darwin, like the watch, some held that the eye was so complex as to defy gradual evolution. Dawkins counters. He takes us from a cell with a light sensitive spot to a creature with several such cells that is helped by this sense of light or dark. Then if the light sensitive cells are recessed, the creature can tell the direction of the shadow. If the recess takes on a cuplike shape, this sense of the light’s direction is enhanced. Next if the walls of the cup build up and protrude partially over the cup, a pinhole camera is formed casting an image on the cup. Then, protecting the cup by extending a membrane over the pinhole forms a lens. And so on…I enjoyed the section on bats and echolocation. Dawkins also offers a reasonable explanation of how this seemingly amazing ability could develop. Dolphins, whales and some birds have independently developed this use of sound showing such development not to be quite as extraordinary as one might think. Dawkins pondering of how bats experience this sense I found fascinating. Do the nerve impulses get mapped by the brain to a model similar to the one we experience as vision? And then there is the fish that senses its environment from disruption to an electrical field – elctrolocation. How is this sense perceived? Another intriguing topic was how sexual selection augments natural selection. Unlike environmental factors which wax and wane in intensity, sexual selection forms a positive feedback loop. A female bird’s preference for long tails in her mate not only promotes the gene for long tails but the gene for the desire for long tails. As both genes proliferate tails will grow longer until a practical limit is reached. The bird still has to be an able flyer to survive. One’s mind quickly turns to how this idea works in humans.This book will mean different things to different readers. Every creationist should read it although I suspect few will. For the rest of us, the book is still worthwhile just to get Dawkins’ unique views on odd and end topics, a few of which I covered. If you get bored reading why creationism is wrong, keep in mind the book is written to be easily read, so you can get through those sections quickly."

104,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"...one of my aims in the book is to convey something of the sheer wonder of biological complexity to those whose eyes have not been opened to it. But having built up the mystery, my other main aim is to remove it again by explaining the solution...He managed the above, but I didn't enjoy this as much as The Selfish Gene or The God Delusion. It delves deeper & wanders around Darwinian Evolution & other theories more than I want or need. I hadn't planned to read this since I understood this from his updated edition of The Selfish Gene, but I found it cheap & needed to bump my Amazon order a bit for free shipping. I'm glad I did.My interest varied & I don't think I would have gotten through a text version without a lot of skimming. He addresses issues/controversies in great detail that I didn't know existed nor was I particularly interested in them, so I found the long refutation boring. Often he digressed to build the knowledge & logic which proves why the other theory or claim is wrong. I find about half of these wanderings interesting, while some just beat the particular subject to death. He starts the preface with the following:This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet...So, I was easily able to finish it & even wanted more due to the wonderful narration &, for all that my interest flagged occasionally, there was plenty of fascinating material. That's incredible in light of the age of this book. Quite a few of the science books & articles I've read that were half as old were terribly dated, but Dawkins is dealing with the theory itself, how genetic change & natural selection works over long time periods to build complex systems, instead of details which may have been superseded as technology runs on. Some of the best parts are his opinions of other scientists. He's very fast to give credit to others where it is due. He touts other books & scientists as better or more thorough on some points while he is obviously incensed at a few. At one point, he finished a particularly scathing denunciation & said perhaps he should go out & dig up the garden. He didn't try for a lot of humor, but when it popped up like that it was great. Even when he's peeved, he is polite & gives them their due, though.His ability to simplify & make sense of large numbers & statistical probability is absolutely masterful. It was great to be able to fiddle with the biomorph program. A search for ""Biomorph Breeder Program"" brings up several interesting ones similar to those Dawkins wrote & used. I understood Dawkins' explanations just fine, but actually playing with the program is really worth it. The extreme effects of random change over time are amazing. He's right, we aren't equipped to really understand large numbers or long times, the obvious problem with Young Earth Creationists' beliefs. Of course, those I know somehow make intentional ignorance & a belief in magic a positive attribute. I find their intellectual dishonesty infuriating, especially so when they try to foist them on me, especially in matters of public policy. (Beliefs should remain private. Public discourse requires facts & logic or there can be no reasoning with each other.)One thing I really missed was an explanation of what a species is. (Does he address speciation in The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene?) For years I thought the criterion was simply the ability to breed with the result of fertile offspring. Then I read this article:https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/08...IOW, I was certain in my ignorance & now that I know more, I'm unsure & somewhat bewildered - a good thing from a scientific point of view, but the lack weakened his arguments a bit for me simply because I spent too much time wondering about it. Still, it had no real bearing on his argument even in the chapter on taxonomy. I had no idea taxonomists disagreed so much. I thought I was the only person who made such a muddle of filing. I loved Dawkins' comparisons to library science. It really made a lot more sense of clades & the various other organization schemes.Table of ContentsChapter I: Explaining the very improbableChapter 2: Good designChapter 3: Accumulating small changeChapter 4: Making tracks through animal spaceChapter 5: The power and the archivesChapter 6: Origins and miraclesChapter 7: Constructive evolutionChapter 8: Explosions and spiralsChapter 9: Puncturing punctuationismChapter 10: The one true tree of lifeChapter 11: Doomed rivalsIt was an excellent read & I'll be referring to parts of it the rest of my life.

105,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Analyzes all the various flavors of Darwinist evolution and some competing theoriesRichard Dawkins is a very lucid and intelligent proponent of evolutionary theory and biology when he isn't getting into vitriolic debates with Creationists, which is an exercise in futility for both sides I'd say. I admire him for trying, but frankly trying to use logic and scientific reasoning with people who think the world is 6,000 years old, was created by an all-powerful being who somehow still tolerates Donald Trump's existence, explain the fossil record and dinosaurs as just tests of faith, and really think the universe is centered around planet Earth is truly a tase of time.So it's good to listen to a book that focuses on evolution, but as this book explores some of the subtle variants of evolutionary theory, like gradualists vs punctuationalists, dismantles Lamarkism and Lysenko, it feels a bit turgid at times, and I thought his much later book The Greatest Show on Earth was more interesting and focused on explaining what non-random natural selection means rather than debunking some other ""weak"" theories."
106,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Here are some key points I gathered from this wonderful wonderful book:- According to Dawkins, Darwinism seems to be more in need of advocacy than other branches of science. For instance, many people have no grasp of quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make them oppose the theory as nonsense. This could have religious implications.- One big problem with Darwinism is that everybody thinks he understands it.- The main reason why most people disbelieve Darwinism is that our brains are built to deal with events on radically different timescales from those that characterize evolutionary change. We have no difficulty visualizing processes that take seconds, minutes, years and decades at most to complete, whereas evolutionary change transpires in millions or hundreds of millions of years. - Man-made artifacts like computers and cars are obviously designed for a purpose, yet they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic rather than of flesh and blood. We are designed on a drawing board too, but were our parts assembled by a skilled engineer? the answer is no. When Charles Darwin first explained the matter, many people either wouldn't or couldn't grasp it.- This book is a rebuttal to William Paley's book (Which I have not read yet) called ""natural theology"". In this book which was lauded by Darwin and Dawkins as an inspiring book at the time, Paley uses the analogy of a watch you find in the middle of a road. Upon seeing such a complex apparatus (think of all the cogs and springs and things used in a watch to make it work), you immediately realize that it must be the product of some intelligent design. It makes no sense to declare it just happened to lie there higgledy-piggledy by mere chance or accident. According to Paley a human organ like an eye is much more complex than a watch, therefore like the watch which requires a watchmaker, the eye requires a designer, or does it?- According to Dawkins, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics. Natural selection is the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered. - Natural selection does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight. It can be said to play the role of the watchmaker in nature, but it's the blind watchmaker and hence the title of this book.- Evidence for evolution is overwhelming, in fact it is so overwhelming that even most theologians have given up believing in instantaneous creation. Nevertheless, many of these theologians have tried to smuggle God in by the back door, so to speak, and they allow him some sort of supervisory role over the course that evolution has taken. Dawkins rightly asserts that we cannot disprove beliefs like these. Be that as it may, there are some problems with these beliefs. Firstly, that they are superfluous and, secondly, that they assume the existence of the main thing we want to explain, namely organized complexity. If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guided evolution, that deity must have already been vastly complex in the first place. * This book is a must-read and highly recommended for anyone who is curious about nature. There are many things I learned like idea of arms races, or what mutations are and what's random and nonrandom and so much more. "
107,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"Some parts of the book are quite intriguing while a few chapters carry some ponderousness, leaving me in a bewilderment of what Dawkins intends to convey .Just put aside the evolutionary theory and natural selection and find something amusing. In the female birds' preference for a long tail section, it seems the female birds were in a dominant position in choosing what kind of male birds she likes, be they long tails or short tails. This reminds me of a hilarious essay of James Thurber which he wrote for The New Yorker in 1939 called Courtship Through the Ages.""Surely nothing in the astonishing scheme of life can have nonplused Nature so much as the fact that none of the females of any of the species she created really cared very much for the male, as such. For the past ten million years Nature has been busily inventing ways to make the male attractive to the female, but the whole business of courtship, from the marine annelids up to man, still lumbers heavily along, like a complicated musical comedy. I have been reading the sad and absorbing story in Volume 6 (Cole to Dama) of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In this volume you can learn about cricket, cotton, costume designing, crocodiles, crown jewels, and Coleridge, but none of this subject is so interesting as the Courtship of animals, which recounts the sorrowful lengths to which all males must go to arouse the interest of a lady.” I don't know why this essay suddenly occurred to me but I confess it is Quite an amusing story to read."
108,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"One of the best and most understandable arguments for evolutionary theory and natural selection Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.In the spirit of Darwin, Dawkins argues soundly, comprehensively, in this form of a non-fiction book rhetorically above average and merely correct. In contrast to his later work ""The God Delusion,"" which is so full of polemics, he refrains from doing so. He endeavors to provide factual and scientifically sound reasoning. Thus he celebrates the breathtaking emergence of highly sophisticated systems such as the human body with the apparent enthusiasm of an evolutionary biologist, who burns for his profession and also does not hesitate to lead various theses against the theory of evolution in the field. Mind you only around, to feed his lines, then enjoyable to dismantle piece by piece and to intone on their ruins a song of praise to the fantastic, developmental severe history of life. Ironically, the title of the work also refers to a book by the creationist pioneer William Paley, who wanted to use God in the form of a watchmaker to depict the ""production"" of all worldly components. Understandably, Dawkins could not resist alienating this clear image of his natural adversary for his purposes and turning the chronograph maker into an unconscious, a meaningless and blind metaphor for natural selection. As an illustration, object to be drawn through the book, the human eye was chosen. Its origins, shapes, and history of development make the reader pause in astonishment with fascinating insights into out of which amazing creatures our windows to the world have watched world eons of years ago.As long as Dawkins lingers in his field of study, the soundness of his lines of reasoning can hardly be counteracted, and until nowadays, this literature, which was published in 1986, cannot be compared with the writing of equal value. Unfortunately, an inappropriate and meanwhile more than obsolete attempt to show a kind of evolution based on the development of computer technology is to be found among the examples. This is a well-intentioned approach, to make the own theses seem even more comprehensive and to use artificial adaptations in as many subjects as possible to provide evidence. However, as in this case, it inevitably fails because of the dry basis and comprehensibility of the theses, which are too constructed and, funny enough, very much reminiscent of the custom of religious fanatics. These try to bend over and put a concept on everything. Also, the all specific too, rather short inserts on medicine and genetics are correct, but in contrast to the rest of the book exhausting to read. One notices that the actual primary operating field is left shortly. In general, the work would do a small renovation in the direction of the current state of research very well, so that the critical minds of the 21st century to have both well-founded and current reasoning for the hopefully eventually ended, meaningless dispute with ignorant people. Despite the small points of criticism an epochal work that seeks its equal in its timeless correctness and the significant, underlying concerns of the Enlightenment. It testifies to the enthusiasm to which professional occupation with the miracle of the creation of life can become. A fortunate coincidence, too, when this gift falls into the hands of a talented narrative man whose tactical acumen dictates that he should not encourage the prevention of water on the mills of his opponents. By withdrawing any basis of existence on a purely factual basis of any religious embarrassment, creation myth, and Genesis. Now the hard facts only have to flow into the consciousness of the people. Dropwise and very slowly. Sticky droplets.Eine der besten und verständlichsten Argumentationsführungen für Evolutionstheorie und natürliche SelektionGanz im Sinne Darwins argumentiert Dawkins stichhaltig, umfassend, in dieser Form für ein Sachbuch rhetorisch überdurchschnittlich gut und schlichtweg richtig. Er hält sich dabei im Gegensatz zu seinem späteren Werk Gotteswahn, das vor Polemik nur so strotzt, zurück. Er ist bemüht, eine sachliche und wissenschaftlich fundierte Argumentation abzuliefern. So feiert er die die atemberaubende Entstehung höchst diffiziler Systeme wie dem menschlichen Körper mit der spürbaren Begeisterung eines Evolutionsbiologen, der für sein Metier brennt und auch nicht davor zurückschreckt, verschiedenste Thesen gegen die Evolutionstheorie ins Feld zu führen. Wohlgemerkt nur um, sich selbst geschickt den Ball zuspielend, sie anschließend genussvoll Stück für Stück zu demontieren und auf ihren Trümmern ein Loblied auf die erstaunliche, seriöse Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebens anzustimmen.Ironisch ist auch der Titel des Werks zu verstehen, der sich auf ein Buch des kreationistischen Vordenkers William Paley bezieht, der anhand Gottes in Form eines Uhrmachers die „Fertigung“ sämtlicher weltlicher Bestandteile darstellen wollte. Verständlich, dass Dawkins nicht widerstehen konnte, dieses krasse Bild seines natürlichen Gegners für eigene Zwecke zu entfremden und aus dem Chronographenhersteller eine unbewusst, ohne Sinn und blind arbeitende Metapher für die natürliche Selektion zu machen.Als ein sich durch das Buch ziehendes Veranschaulichungsobjekt wurde das menschliche Auge gewählt. Dessen Ursprung, Formen und Entwicklungsgeschichte lassen mit den faszinierenden Erkenntnissen, aus welch unerwarteten Kreaturen unsere Fenster zur Welt vor Äonen von Jahren geblickt haben, den Leser vor Erstaunen innehalten. Solange Dawkins in seinem Fachbereich verweilt ist der Stichhaltigkeit seiner Argumentationsketten kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen und man kann diesem 1986 erschienen Werk bis heute wenig gleichwertige Literatur zur Seite stellen. Leider ist auch ein unpassender und mittlerweile mehr als nur veralteter Versuch, anhand der Entwicklung der Computertechnik eine Art von Evolution aufzeigen zu wollen, unter den Beispielen. Das ist ein gut gemeinter Ansatz, die eigenen Thesen noch umfassender erscheinen zu lassen und künstliche Adaptionen in möglichst vielen Themenkreisen zur Erbringung von Belegen heranzuziehen. Es scheitert aber, wie in diesem Fall, zwangsläufig an der unzureichenden Basis und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Thesen, die allzu konstruiert sind und lustigerweise sehr an den Usus der religiösen Fanatiker erinnern. Diese versuchen auch auf Biegen und Brechen ein Konzept über alles zu stülpen.Auch sind die allzu fachspezifisch ausgeführten, eher kurzen Einschübe über Medizin und Genetik zwar richtig, aber im Kontrast zum Rest des Buches anstrengend zu lesen. Man merkt, dass das eigentliche Hauptbetätigungsfeld kurzfristig verlassen wird. Generell täte dem Werk eine kleine Renovierung in Richtung des aktuellen Standes der Forschung sehr gut, damit auch die kritischen Geister des 21. Jahrhunderts sowohl wohlfundierte als auch aktuelle Argumentationen für den hoffentlich irgendwann beendeten, sinnbefreiten Disput mit ignoranten Mitmenschen haben.Trotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte eine epochales Werk, dass in seiner zeitlosen Richtigkeit und dem hehren, dahinterstehenden Anliegen der Aufklärung seinesgleichen sucht. Es zeugt von der Begeisterungsfähigkeit, zu der die berufliche Beschäftigung mit dem Wunder der Entstehung des Lebens werden kann. Ein glücklicher Zufall auch, wenn diese Gabe in die Hände eines noch dazu erzählerisch talentierten Mannes fällt, dessen taktischer Scharfsinn ihm gebietet, der Prävention des Wassers auf die Mühlen seiner Gegner keinen Vorschub zu leisten. Indem er auf einer rein sachlichen Basis jeglicher Art von religiöser Verbrämung, Schöpfungsmythos und Entstehungsmären jegliche Existenzgrundlage entzieht. Jetzt müssen die harten Fakten nur noch ins Bewusstsein der Menschen einfließen. Tröpfchenweise und sehr langsam. Klebrige Tröpfchen."
109,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,5,"The Blind Watchmaker is probably one of the best introductory books on evolution.Dawkins takes his time, explaining step by step how Darwinian evolution works.Dawkins explains at great length, how species that look like a ""complex design"" evolve with accumulating small changes via natural selection, why natural selection is ""blind""; ie. it lacks purpose, how random mutations combined with non-random natural selection is necessary for evolution to take place, and why a ""complex design"" does not necessarily mean a ""good design"" (such as ganglion cells which make the electronic wiring interface between the photocells and the brain, face light directly, whereas photocells sit away from the light source in human eye; compared to octopus eye that has photocells facing the light source).Then the structure of genetic blueprint (DNA) is explained; how DNA archives are being copied from cell to cell and from individual to individual, how copy errors are made, and how mutations can occur.In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity of pure randomness as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the Weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.If you are curious about evolution and choose the best introductory book on the subject this is the one."
110,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I enjoyed this book very much, despite the difficulty of reading the very small typeface. Dawkins' style is almost folksy, and not at all the arrogant, condescending style that some reviewers mention. The first chapter, about echolocation in bats, is fascinating. I also enjoyed reading about the different philosophies involved in taxonomy, the classification of species. Some reviewers mention that Dawkins' explanations are ""old hat"", and that the computer simulations are primitive; but they do need to keep in mind that the book is already 25 years old! While I do appreciate the arguments Dawkins puts forward against saltationists and punctuationalists, I found them to be repetitive and boring after a while."
111,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/490192-charles,2,"Enchantingly beautiful fiction, 23 Mar 2007  Musings of a fideist (a materialistic fideist). Richard Dawkins has a breathtaking gift for expressive, catchy writing. His handling of illustration and narrative flow like silk. Yet he reminds me of an eloquent 19th century clergyman. His persistent dedication to the high altar of gradualistic explanation, however incredibly improbable, stretches credulity to breaking point. Take for example his extraordinary leap on p.134, para 1, where self-replicating RNA will almost magically come into being - 'all so utterly simple and automatic'. There it is by fiat - Dawkins wishes and so it must be! Abracadabra! Those who have worked in the field know how fasitidious and temperamental RNA and enzymes can be even in the best conditions - yet here it is in rock pool. There are some problems even billions of years won't solve - ask the mathematicians. Or take his extraordinary and uncharacteristically rambling tautology about the peacock's tail, pp 203-206, which boils down to an unexplained discrepancy in tail length (p204) and majority female taste (p205)! This is no cogent defence of evolution of an extraordinarily complex structure, just a mystical will-of-the-wisp-like weaving of concepts to meet his desired end. He reiterates Darwin's acid test of his own theory, on p 91, but if really believed what he wrote there, he would have abandoned neo-Darwinism years ago - I have long since published one very clear example of what he seeks, and his written answer to me was that he couldn't answer it, and there are myriad more. Dawkins is a magician with words, though not as self critical and cautious as he ought to be with scientific argument. "
112,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"I have only ever read one other Dawkins book before, The God Delusion, and really didn't like the style or attitude of the writing, so was not completely looking forward to this one.The primary aim of the book is to look at all the evidence and theories that make up the Darwinian theory of evolution and natural selection. He considers all the evidence from real life examples, in particular the eye, and buy using a computer program that he wrote, demonstrates how new variants of a species can evolve with very simple initial amendments. Later on in the book he looks at how DNA works, the effects of positive feedback on evolution and the way that mutations works of evolution and selection. He also considers the complexity of trying to document the tree of life.Overall I thought this book was a better read than the previous one I had read. Bearing in mind it was written originally in 1986 most of it is still valid, though we now understand far more than we did then. He can get on his high horse quite often, but thankfully not so much in this book."

More people would be convinced watching an episode of Sagan's Cosmos than slugging through this book. I still remember how Cosmos changed the teenage me. Just remember the high-and-mighty all-smiles Sagan! This preacher, one Ricky Dawkins, with his pompous writing, repeating the same phrases, picking fight with other preachers of the same flock (like Reverend Steven J Gould) and offering the worldview that no other beliefs have a sensible place en este mundo may actually repulse a lot of would-be converts.But what I cannot deny is, I am a sucker for this preacher. Through and through."

I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:“A physicist certainly doesn’t need Darwinism in order to do physics. He might think that biology is a trivial subject compared with physics. It would follow from this that, in his opinion, Darwinism is of trivial importance to science. But he could not sensibly conclude from this that it is therefore false!”Understanding how Darwinian evolution works can change your attitude toward life and self, substantially. What we learned about Darwin at high school is inadequate. This book provides you with simplified biochemistry, biology, math, physics, and reasoning so that you can easily conceive why Darwinism is the most reasonable answer to world's complexity.I would like to quote another part:“In Darwin’s view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of complex adaptations. For what it is worth, it is also the whole point of this book. For Darwin, any evolution that had to be helped over the jumps by God was not evolution at all. It made a nonsense of the central point of evolution. In the light of this, it is easy to see why Darwin constantly reiterated the gradualness of evolution.”This way of thinking is not just confined to the past. Evolutionary-based science is taking over a lot of fields. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University is a leading one. You can find out more at: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/ "
115,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27367650-brian-cloutier,4,"The good part: Dawkins is a great writer. His style is very conversational and the book very quotable. His arguments follow a defined path but still manage to meander through welcome asides. He uses metaphors and thought experiments well, most of the book was very easy to follow.And what arguments he makes! The probability of miracles, potential precursors of RNA, the importance of gradual change. His goal is to show that it's possible to explain the rise of complexity from a simple world and he spectacularly succeeds.However, I'm likely not the intended audience of this book. He spent more time arguing against alternative theories than I would have liked. I had no idea what Mutationism was before he explained it but it sounded dumb within the first few sentences; he didn't need to spend as many pages dismissing it as he did. Same with the entire chapter on Punctuationism. The first few pages went over some really cool notes on speciation and how some large mutations fit into darwinism that the book wouldn't have been complete without. The rest of the chapter tried to defend darwinism from a media I had never paid attention to in the first place.The last third of the book is worth reading because it contains a few insights. But, finishing it is true drudgery and tarnishes my impression of the book as a whole."

When they say: 'nature designed a creature like this and that.', 'it gave them wings' etc. I was thinking: 'What nonsense is this? It's not possible, nature isn't smart to design a complex creature'. But, I was all wrong.Nature doesn't have to be smart to design something. Living beings don't emerge by luck or chance but from necessity. Small and gradual steps make those creatures climb mount improbable, and they happen to look like highly designed creatures.True knowledge not always resides within your gut instincts and common sense. For example, the book explains that if there's a grand designer, it must have been designed too. Therefore, as the book shows, there is no design, only emergence. Only you need to have an open mind to see the truth. Think logically, you will find the truth."

With a contagious passion and a load of patience (because, quite frankly, you need a massive amount of it to face the rubbish circulating on such topics!) the biologist is once again enchanting us. In fact, we feel like a little child holding his hand, admiring all the wonders he's pointing at: nature is wonderful as it is; don't be afraid to toss God (or whatever you want to call it) in the bin.

121,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"I should explain the point about the watchmaker. A SMALL ROCKIf you’re walking along in the countryside and you come across a rock, you don’t say, well, where the hell did that come from and who made it? It’s a rock. No one cares. There’s no notices stuck on trees or printed in local free newspapers anywhere saying “have you seen this rock? Description – roughly three inches by four by three; last seen in the Dorchester area; undistinctive grey colouring; answers to the name of “rock”; reward – please call this number; WE MISS YOU ROCK” . It’s a rock. ON THE OTHER HAND, A GOLD WATCHNow, if you saw a beautiful gold watch on your walk in the countryside, you would say – lo! a watch – I deduce that someone has lost a watch and it is here; also, I furthermore deduce that there must be a God.” Richard Dawkins says that watches, or indeed anything complicated, do not infer the existence of a watchmaker. Or, to use a different analogy, a book, which can be a complicated thing, does not infer the existence of an author. You could say well, here’s a book called The Blind Watchmaker and it says it’s by Richard Dawkins, so we see that Richard Dawkins is the author and he wrote this book, but Richard Dawkins would say NO! it doesn’t, have you not been paying attention, have you been giggling and passing notes in the back row again? EVOLUTION OF THE SEMICOLONWhat happened is that gradually, over many billions of years, language formed, inconceivably slowly, for instance it took ten million years for commas to evolve out of a full stop, and another ten million for the exotic semi-colon to evolve out of the comma. So this book The Blind Watchmaker (like all other books) evolved slowly. We have fossils to prove this. They show the missing links. We have, for instance, copies of the book which are called The Blond Watchmaker dating from the Devonian period – it took several millions of years for the Blond to evolve into the Blind, you see. I read that Mexican paleontologists recently unearthed a copy called The Bland Watchmaker. Going back further , we find all sorts of evolutionary byways that, because of natural selection, died out eventually. One manuscript from the late Pleistocene period which is currently on display at the University of East Anglia shows a strange hybrid between an early version of The Blind Watchmaker and Alice in Wonderland in which the famous teaparty scene features a pterodactyl, a plesiosaur (so very unlikely) and a crazed archaeopteryx. This unviable literary form did not survive, as we know. Natural selection, although brutal from our limited human perspective, explains the evolution of complex things. RELIGION CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY TWILIGHT IS POPULARGod cannot explain why the book species “Stephanie Myers” and “Dan Brown”, for instance, proliferate wildly in many varied habitats, whilst arguably more beautiful forms like Henry James, Proust, and the Golden Tamarin dwindle to the point where human intervention from libraries and literary professors are the only thing keeping them from sinking into oblivion – no, God cannot explain this. But Richard Dawkins (also known as ""Science"") can.Sorry, that should be “Richard Dawkins”."
122,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dawkins loves explaining evolutionary theory, and this is one of his best books. My favourite bit is the section on long-tailed birds (peacocks, etc). From the point of view of simple utility, they are rather baffling. What use could you possibly have for that long, stupid tail?But, as Dawkins keeps reminding us, it's not about survival of the species, or even of the individual, but rather of the gene. Suppose there's a sex-linked male gene that disposes towards long tails, and a sex-linked female gene that disposes towards finding long tails attractive. A child born of a union between two individuals carrying these genes will be likely to have both of them. Hence, if it's male, it'll have a long tail, and if it's female it will prefer males with long tails. If this combination becomes common, long-tailed males will have a larger and larger advantage in terms of being preferred by females. Tails will lengthen until the practical downside (being unable to fly, avoid predators, etc) counterbalances the upside of efficiently attracting potential mates.I read this, and suddenly looked at supermodels in a new light. God, they're hot! In fact, if they were any hotter they'd be dead. "
123,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"As the title's extension spells out, this is a definitive (as of '87) rebuttal against all comers in favor of Darwinism, but don't let my saying so prove it. Read it for yourself.All his arguments are crystal clear, but he takes extra time to caricature the caricature of Darwinists, pointing out exactly how the ad absurdum argument really works while also elucidating the fine points of what Darwinism IS versus what it is NOT.He steps us through the first third of the book showing us how Selection works: from an energy standpoint, a competition standpoint, and a sexual standpoint... from the basic building blocks of proteins to more and more complex forms of DNA and the combo cells that collect all the wonderful multicellular creations, including bacteria, that eventually wind up creating us. The descriptions are quite beautiful and clear and all the while, we've got all the foundations for life... without Intelligent Design. The argument is simple, of course. If we can explain everything, and I mean everything that is life and physics, then what purpose does adding a superfluous layer to the explanation serve?This is ten years worth of hate mail for the author, people. He has been beset on all sides with genuinely curious and well-meaning seekers of the god-fearing sort and inundated with screaming lunatics telling him he'll burn in hell for his first book, The Selfish Gene, which, by the way, didn't really give a rat's ass about creationism or the people who support it. It just laid out a very cogent theory that fit all the copious mountains of data in biology. And yet, after that point, a Mr. Dawkins who professes not to want or need a PR team or lawyers, decides to put his foot down and tackle the problem that has reared its muti-angled head in his direction and DEFEND Darwinism.He does so beautifully, I might add. Every step of the way, he defines the complaints with due diligence and proceeds to demolish them sonar-producing batlike grace, with light humor, sharp intellect, and sometimes he makes of his opponents an overzealous meal. Can you blame him? Granted, by this point it's only been a decade of Creationist hate. Give it a decade or a decade and a half more before we see a truly flame worthy attack from Mr.Dawkins. I'm looking forward to seeing some of it in his books. I hope it's there and not just in his interviews which I still haven't seen. Alas.Seriously, though, this book is pretty wonderful for its lucid and quoteworthy passages and vivid descriptions of how Darwinism works, from gene level to the kinds of time-spans that can only be described as geological when it comes to real changes in evolution. I particularly loved the fact that he used computer terminology to describe how our genes are nothing more than complex computers. I've heard this before, of course, but the way he laid it out was particularly enlightening.This stuff is pretty damn great. Just from the science viewpoint, even leaving out the whole defense, it's well worth reading and not nearly as acerbic or rabid as certain other mass-produced troll-attacks make him appear. But then again, I've only read one of his later books, the The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, which was just a charming bi-modal description of science versus magical thinking which also happened to ""gently"" draw people away from having to add that extra layer of explanation to reality. :) I guess I'll see what the other books bring, no?"
124,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,2,"It is a good thing that Dawkins himself takes the trouble to think about which chapters of his books will be of vanishing interest in the near future. Of course, he turned out to be more accurate than he must have wished for. This must be the most boring of all Dawkins’ books, but I do not want to give up on him till I read ‘The Extended Phenotype’ which just might prove to be the best (scientifically) of all his works. With whole chapters devoted to the driest taxonomy problems and to disproving outdated theories, the book was a massive waste of time once I went past the mildly interesting first half. But, it still provides an opportunity to use Dawkins’ own method of caricature-based argument to paint a caricature of his own positions in ‘The God Delusion’ based on his own vitriolic stands in this book. I will try to examine in detail how Dawkins has betrayed his own principles of scientific grounding and rational rigorousness in The God Delusion by using arguments and structures from this book in the review. Hopefully that will happen by tomorrow..."

127,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34331-laura,2,"This book was okay, but since I already am convinced evolution occurs by natural selection, I felt like he was not preaching to the choir, but trying to convince the choir. Of course, I got tired of it after a while (but I had to keep going, because I had to read it for a class). He comes up with many different arguments/theories for how evolution/natural selection could occur, many of which are interesting, but I would just rather read a science book rather than a philosophical book on evolution. For instance, I recommend The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner, which shows how scientists study evolution and natural selection in action. "
128,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Two summers ago, I did myself the favor of reading The Selfish Gene. Well, I didn’t quite read it; rather, I listened to Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, narrate the book, as I took long walks in the forest near my house. Incidentally, I think Dawkins (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lalla) has a magnificent voice; it’s a pleasure to hear him speak.  But that’s a matter of taste; what is not a matter of taste is the quality of that book. Agree or disagree with Dawkins, one must admit that The Selfish Gene is a book of the finest quality. Indeed, I must say that I wasn’t quite prepared for how good it was. I was expecting an entertaining book of popular science; what I got was an eloquent, subtle, and powerful book which managed, in a just a couple weeks of long walks, to completely transform my understanding of animal behavior. This book, The Blind Watchmaker—also listened to in a few long walks—is not of the same caliber. But it is quite good. (Well, if it were written by almost anybody except Dawkins himself, I would say it was very good—but I know the heights he can reach.) I know close to nothing about his advocacy of atheism, and frankly I don’t much care, but I think the public has a rare treasure in Dawkins; what other popular biology writer can compare? Dawkins is, to an almost remarkable extent, as much a philosopher as a scientist. This book, as well as his first, is jammed full of thought experiments; Dawkins simply can’t get enough of them. This emphasis on philosophical argumentation allows him, so to speak, to take the reader inside the logic of Darwinism (as well as inside the fuzzy logic of Darwinism’s opponents). He doesn’t simply tell the reader things biologists think—like a reporter sending dispatches from the front lines—but tries to get the layreader to understand exactly why biologists think what they do. As a result, his books can actually be a bit dense and exhausting; but the patient reader is amply rewarded with a deepened understanding. The main reason that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as his first was that Dawkins spends an awful lot of time dealing with contemporary controversies. This was, I believe, a time of the famed ‘Darwin Wars’, when Gould and his followers had highly publicized debates with team Dawkins. Apparently, reporters were very eager to report anything even slightly critical of Darwinian theory—whether it be from taxonomists, paleontologists, or priests—so Dawkins was forced to spend a lot of time on material that, to today’s reader, may be of limited interest. For example, Dawkins becomes almost pedantic in his chapter on punctuated equilibrium, as he argues again and again that Gould is not a ‘true’ saltationist, but only a modified gradualist. Having read Gould, I was personally interested in this; but I would understand if others were not. Perhaps I was not the book’s target audience, as I needed no convincing that Darwinian evolution is both a well-supported and a powerful theory. Nonetheless, Dawkins did manage to clear up some of evolution’s finer point for me. I was particularly excited when (not to take too much credit) Dawkins confirmed a suspicion that I had expressed a few years back, when I was learning about human evolution. I was actually in Kenya, studying with the Leakeys, who—being the Leakeys—had plastic casts of several dozen important hominin fossils in their lab. As my anatomy teacher enjoyed pointing out, the vast majority of hominin fossils for any given species can fit inside a shoebox. Most of the fossils are distorted, broken, or otherwise fragmentary. Yet from these scant remains, paleoanthropologists expend tremendous energy arguing about the hominin family tree. Is this skull cap Homo erectus or Homo habilis? Is this thigh bone from an early homo or a late autralopithecus? Somewhat exasperated by all this ambiguity—about what appeared to me to be a matter of words—I got an idea: what if the idea of ‘species’ itself breaks down in an evolutionary timescale? After all, if we believe that species change via gradual selection one to another, it follows that there must be individuals intermediate between any two given hominin species, and, furthermore, individuals intermediate between the intermediates—and so on. Eureka! Well, it turns out Dawkins (as well as many other, probably) had the very same idea long before; it appears that convergent evolution is even more prevalent among memes than genes. (As a side note, if one believes, like Gould, in punctuated equilibrium, then ‘species’ would still be valid in an evolutionary timescale. Perhaps this is why the paleoanthropologists are still arguing?) I got sidetracked—back to the book. (Speaking of sidetracked, Dawkins is the master of the interesting aside and the lengthy digression; and, even more impressively, he always manages to tie his asides and digressions neatly back into the main theme under discussion.) Well, I’m afraid I don’t have very much more to say, other than this: if you find yourself with a supply of long walks, and need an audiobook as accompaniment, you might as well download Dawkins’s crisp, dry, whispery voice, and deepen your understanding of the flora and fauna around you—whether it be this book or, if you want a real treat, his first."
129,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd,5,"Dawkins is one of my top picks for the most articulate, engaging and proficient scientists I've read to date. The Blind Watchmaker turned out to be a very prolific piece. I was baffled by his logical analogies, most excellent examples and extremely engaging vernacular. In this work, one learns much about the evolutionary adaptations of numerous species, of which the sonar technology of baths, dolphins and other mammals seemed most shocking.His reasoning of what constitutes miracles, probability theory and reasoning behind the drawback of the Lamark's theory of acquired characteristics is exceptionally enticing. The book should be a required high-school reading. A very, very high recommendation."
130,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7503511-seth-hanson,4,"At the time, this was a tough book for me to read. Considering the way I was raised - in a heavily religious atmosphere - it was hard for me to accept the theory of evolution. However, Dawkins very clearly lays out the theory in a way that anyone can understand if they are willing to open their mind just a little and put in just a little effort. It might be hard to accept but its even harder to dispute. Reality is like that. I think everyone should be required to read this book. "
131,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins’ outstanding The Selfish Gene, my initial impression of The Blind Watchmaker was a bit of a letdown. Dawkins wrote the book to counter creationist thinking, but for a firm believer in Darwinian evolution, his lengthy arguments were unnecessary. However, if Dawkins converted any creationists, I would consider the book a great success. With that said, there were a number of things I did like. Below are some items that caught my attention.Darwin’s concept of gradual evolution overturned the ideas of the catastrophists, who believed the earth and its creatures were formed by sudden drastic changes. Gradual evolution was then challenged by saltationists who believed large genetic changes or macro-mutations could explain much of evolution. A more refined view is that of Stephen Jay Gould who posited punctuated equilibrium. This view recognized varying rates of change, periods of relative stasis with intervals of rapid modification. Keep in mind rapid was on a geologic time scale where 50,000 years is a short time. Thus Gould’s rapid change could still have evolved step-by-step in line with Darwin. The effect of gradualism that struck me was the notion that speciation is contingent on the demise of intermediate individuals. Otherwise one could not tell where one species began and another ended.An upshot of Dawkins’ idea concerns our own connection with our ancestors. The view of chimpanzees as property is made more acceptable because there are no living intermediaries that show our close relationship. This made me wonder how Neanderthals would be treated if some were found alive. Would they be treated like chimpanzees as a different species? Since they are beings who can successfully interbreed with Homo sapiens, would they be given the same rights? Would Christians consider them as individuals with souls that should be saved? I enjoyed Dawkins explanation of the development of the eye in support of gradualism. The book’s title comes from a pre-Darwin argument that if one found a watch, one would have to assume someone made it. The watch is too intricate to have formed naturally. Post-Darwin, like the watch, some held that the eye was so complex as to defy gradual evolution. Dawkins counters. He takes us from a cell with a light sensitive spot to a creature with several such cells that is helped by this sense of light or dark. Then if the light sensitive cells are recessed, the creature can tell the direction of the shadow. If the recess takes on a cuplike shape, this sense of the light’s direction is enhanced. Next if the walls of the cup build up and protrude partially over the cup, a pinhole camera is formed casting an image on the cup. Then, protecting the cup by extending a membrane over the pinhole forms a lens. And so on…I enjoyed the section on bats and echolocation. Dawkins also offers a reasonable explanation of how this seemingly amazing ability could develop. Dolphins, whales and some birds have independently developed this use of sound showing such development not to be quite as extraordinary as one might think. Dawkins pondering of how bats experience this sense I found fascinating. Do the nerve impulses get mapped by the brain to a model similar to the one we experience as vision? And then there is the fish that senses its environment from disruption to an electrical field – elctrolocation. How is this sense perceived? Another intriguing topic was how sexual selection augments natural selection. Unlike environmental factors which wax and wane in intensity, sexual selection forms a positive feedback loop. A female bird’s preference for long tails in her mate not only promotes the gene for long tails but the gene for the desire for long tails. As both genes proliferate tails will grow longer until a practical limit is reached. The bird still has to be an able flyer to survive. One’s mind quickly turns to how this idea works in humans.This book will mean different things to different readers. Every creationist should read it although I suspect few will. For the rest of us, the book is still worthwhile just to get Dawkins’ unique views on odd and end topics, a few of which I covered. If you get bored reading why creationism is wrong, keep in mind the book is written to be easily read, so you can get through those sections quickly."

134,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"...one of my aims in the book is to convey something of the sheer wonder of biological complexity to those whose eyes have not been opened to it. But having built up the mystery, my other main aim is to remove it again by explaining the solution...He managed the above, but I didn't enjoy this as much as The Selfish Gene or The God Delusion. It delves deeper & wanders around Darwinian Evolution & other theories more than I want or need. I hadn't planned to read this since I understood this from his updated edition of The Selfish Gene, but I found it cheap & needed to bump my Amazon order a bit for free shipping. I'm glad I did.My interest varied & I don't think I would have gotten through a text version without a lot of skimming. He addresses issues/controversies in great detail that I didn't know existed nor was I particularly interested in them, so I found the long refutation boring. Often he digressed to build the knowledge & logic which proves why the other theory or claim is wrong. I find about half of these wanderings interesting, while some just beat the particular subject to death. He starts the preface with the following:This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet...So, I was easily able to finish it & even wanted more due to the wonderful narration &, for all that my interest flagged occasionally, there was plenty of fascinating material. That's incredible in light of the age of this book. Quite a few of the science books & articles I've read that were half as old were terribly dated, but Dawkins is dealing with the theory itself, how genetic change & natural selection works over long time periods to build complex systems, instead of details which may have been superseded as technology runs on. Some of the best parts are his opinions of other scientists. He's very fast to give credit to others where it is due. He touts other books & scientists as better or more thorough on some points while he is obviously incensed at a few. At one point, he finished a particularly scathing denunciation & said perhaps he should go out & dig up the garden. He didn't try for a lot of humor, but when it popped up like that it was great. Even when he's peeved, he is polite & gives them their due, though.His ability to simplify & make sense of large numbers & statistical probability is absolutely masterful. It was great to be able to fiddle with the biomorph program. A search for ""Biomorph Breeder Program"" brings up several interesting ones similar to those Dawkins wrote & used. I understood Dawkins' explanations just fine, but actually playing with the program is really worth it. The extreme effects of random change over time are amazing. He's right, we aren't equipped to really understand large numbers or long times, the obvious problem with Young Earth Creationists' beliefs. Of course, those I know somehow make intentional ignorance & a belief in magic a positive attribute. I find their intellectual dishonesty infuriating, especially so when they try to foist them on me, especially in matters of public policy. (Beliefs should remain private. Public discourse requires facts & logic or there can be no reasoning with each other.)One thing I really missed was an explanation of what a species is. (Does he address speciation in The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene?) For years I thought the criterion was simply the ability to breed with the result of fertile offspring. Then I read this article:https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/08...IOW, I was certain in my ignorance & now that I know more, I'm unsure & somewhat bewildered - a good thing from a scientific point of view, but the lack weakened his arguments a bit for me simply because I spent too much time wondering about it. Still, it had no real bearing on his argument even in the chapter on taxonomy. I had no idea taxonomists disagreed so much. I thought I was the only person who made such a muddle of filing. I loved Dawkins' comparisons to library science. It really made a lot more sense of clades & the various other organization schemes.Table of ContentsChapter I: Explaining the very improbableChapter 2: Good designChapter 3: Accumulating small changeChapter 4: Making tracks through animal spaceChapter 5: The power and the archivesChapter 6: Origins and miraclesChapter 7: Constructive evolutionChapter 8: Explosions and spiralsChapter 9: Puncturing punctuationismChapter 10: The one true tree of lifeChapter 11: Doomed rivalsIt was an excellent read & I'll be referring to parts of it the rest of my life. He says that Explaining is a difficult art.

135,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Analyzes all the various flavors of Darwinist evolution and some competing theoriesRichard Dawkins is a very lucid and intelligent proponent of evolutionary theory and biology when he isn't getting into vitriolic debates with Creationists, which is an exercise in futility for both sides I'd say. I admire him for trying, but frankly trying to use logic and scientific reasoning with people who think the world is 6,000 years old, was created by an all-powerful being who somehow still tolerates Donald Trump's existence, explain the fossil record and dinosaurs as just tests of faith, and really think the universe is centered around planet Earth is truly a tase of time.So it's good to listen to a book that focuses on evolution, but as this book explores some of the subtle variants of evolutionary theory, like gradualists vs punctuationalists, dismantles Lamarkism and Lysenko, it feels a bit turgid at times, and I thought his much later book The Greatest Show on Earth was more interesting and focused on explaining what non-random natural selection means rather than debunking some other ""weak"" theories."
136,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Here are some key points I gathered from this wonderful wonderful book:- According to Dawkins, Darwinism seems to be more in need of advocacy than other branches of science. For instance, many people have no grasp of quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make them oppose the theory as nonsense. This could have religious implications.- One big problem with Darwinism is that everybody thinks he understands it.- The main reason why most people disbelieve Darwinism is that our brains are built to deal with events on radically different timescales from those that characterize evolutionary change. We have no difficulty visualizing processes that take seconds, minutes, years and decades at most to complete, whereas evolutionary change transpires in millions or hundreds of millions of years. - Man-made artifacts like computers and cars are obviously designed for a purpose, yet they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic rather than of flesh and blood. We are designed on a drawing board too, but were our parts assembled by a skilled engineer? the answer is no. When Charles Darwin first explained the matter, many people either wouldn't or couldn't grasp it.- This book is a rebuttal to William Paley's book (Which I have not read yet) called ""natural theology"". In this book which was lauded by Darwin and Dawkins as an inspiring book at the time, Paley uses the analogy of a watch you find in the middle of a road. Upon seeing such a complex apparatus (think of all the cogs and springs and things used in a watch to make it work), you immediately realize that it must be the product of some intelligent design. It makes no sense to declare it just happened to lie there higgledy-piggledy by mere chance or accident. According to Paley a human organ like an eye is much more complex than a watch, therefore like the watch which requires a watchmaker, the eye requires a designer, or does it?- According to Dawkins, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics. Natural selection is the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered. - Natural selection does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight. It can be said to play the role of the watchmaker in nature, but it's the blind watchmaker and hence the title of this book.- Evidence for evolution is overwhelming, in fact it is so overwhelming that even most theologians have given up believing in instantaneous creation. Nevertheless, many of these theologians have tried to smuggle God in by the back door, so to speak, and they allow him some sort of supervisory role over the course that evolution has taken. Dawkins rightly asserts that we cannot disprove beliefs like these. Be that as it may, there are some problems with these beliefs. Firstly, that they are superfluous and, secondly, that they assume the existence of the main thing we want to explain, namely organized complexity. If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guided evolution, that deity must have already been vastly complex in the first place. * This book is a must-read and highly recommended for anyone who is curious about nature. There are many things I learned like idea of arms races, or what mutations are and what's random and nonrandom and so much more. "
137,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"Some parts of the book are quite intriguing while a few chapters carry some ponderousness, leaving me in a bewilderment of what Dawkins intends to convey .Just put aside the evolutionary theory and natural selection and find something amusing. In the female birds' preference for a long tail section, it seems the female birds were in a dominant position in choosing what kind of male birds she likes, be they long tails or short tails. This reminds me of a hilarious essay of James Thurber which he wrote for The New Yorker in 1939 called Courtship Through the Ages.""Surely nothing in the astonishing scheme of life can have nonplused Nature so much as the fact that none of the females of any of the species she created really cared very much for the male, as such. For the past ten million years Nature has been busily inventing ways to make the male attractive to the female, but the whole business of courtship, from the marine annelids up to man, still lumbers heavily along, like a complicated musical comedy. I have been reading the sad and absorbing story in Volume 6 (Cole to Dama) of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In this volume you can learn about cricket, cotton, costume designing, crocodiles, crown jewels, and Coleridge, but none of this subject is so interesting as the Courtship of animals, which recounts the sorrowful lengths to which all males must go to arouse the interest of a lady.” I don't know why this essay suddenly occurred to me but I confess it is Quite an amusing story to read."
138,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"One of the best and most understandable arguments for evolutionary theory and natural selection Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.In the spirit of Darwin, Dawkins argues soundly, comprehensively, in this form of a non-fiction book rhetorically above average and merely correct. In contrast to his later work ""The God Delusion,"" which is so full of polemics, he refrains from doing so. He endeavors to provide factual and scientifically sound reasoning. Thus he celebrates the breathtaking emergence of highly sophisticated systems such as the human body with the apparent enthusiasm of an evolutionary biologist, who burns for his profession and also does not hesitate to lead various theses against the theory of evolution in the field. Mind you only around, to feed his lines, then enjoyable to dismantle piece by piece and to intone on their ruins a song of praise to the fantastic, developmental severe history of life. Ironically, the title of the work also refers to a book by the creationist pioneer William Paley, who wanted to use God in the form of a watchmaker to depict the ""production"" of all worldly components. Understandably, Dawkins could not resist alienating this clear image of his natural adversary for his purposes and turning the chronograph maker into an unconscious, a meaningless and blind metaphor for natural selection. As an illustration, object to be drawn through the book, the human eye was chosen. Its origins, shapes, and history of development make the reader pause in astonishment with fascinating insights into out of which amazing creatures our windows to the world have watched world eons of years ago.As long as Dawkins lingers in his field of study, the soundness of his lines of reasoning can hardly be counteracted, and until nowadays, this literature, which was published in 1986, cannot be compared with the writing of equal value. Unfortunately, an inappropriate and meanwhile more than obsolete attempt to show a kind of evolution based on the development of computer technology is to be found among the examples. This is a well-intentioned approach, to make the own theses seem even more comprehensive and to use artificial adaptations in as many subjects as possible to provide evidence. However, as in this case, it inevitably fails because of the dry basis and comprehensibility of the theses, which are too constructed and, funny enough, very much reminiscent of the custom of religious fanatics. These try to bend over and put a concept on everything. Also, the all specific too, rather short inserts on medicine and genetics are correct, but in contrast to the rest of the book exhausting to read. One notices that the actual primary operating field is left shortly. In general, the work would do a small renovation in the direction of the current state of research very well, so that the critical minds of the 21st century to have both well-founded and current reasoning for the hopefully eventually ended, meaningless dispute with ignorant people. Despite the small points of criticism an epochal work that seeks its equal in its timeless correctness and the significant, underlying concerns of the Enlightenment. It testifies to the enthusiasm to which professional occupation with the miracle of the creation of life can become. A fortunate coincidence, too, when this gift falls into the hands of a talented narrative man whose tactical acumen dictates that he should not encourage the prevention of water on the mills of his opponents. By withdrawing any basis of existence on a purely factual basis of any religious embarrassment, creation myth, and Genesis. Now the hard facts only have to flow into the consciousness of the people. Dropwise and very slowly. Sticky droplets.Eine der besten und verständlichsten Argumentationsführungen für Evolutionstheorie und natürliche SelektionGanz im Sinne Darwins argumentiert Dawkins stichhaltig, umfassend, in dieser Form für ein Sachbuch rhetorisch überdurchschnittlich gut und schlichtweg richtig. Er hält sich dabei im Gegensatz zu seinem späteren Werk Gotteswahn, das vor Polemik nur so strotzt, zurück. Er ist bemüht, eine sachliche und wissenschaftlich fundierte Argumentation abzuliefern. So feiert er die die atemberaubende Entstehung höchst diffiziler Systeme wie dem menschlichen Körper mit der spürbaren Begeisterung eines Evolutionsbiologen, der für sein Metier brennt und auch nicht davor zurückschreckt, verschiedenste Thesen gegen die Evolutionstheorie ins Feld zu führen. Wohlgemerkt nur um, sich selbst geschickt den Ball zuspielend, sie anschließend genussvoll Stück für Stück zu demontieren und auf ihren Trümmern ein Loblied auf die erstaunliche, seriöse Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebens anzustimmen.Ironisch ist auch der Titel des Werks zu verstehen, der sich auf ein Buch des kreationistischen Vordenkers William Paley bezieht, der anhand Gottes in Form eines Uhrmachers die „Fertigung“ sämtlicher weltlicher Bestandteile darstellen wollte. Verständlich, dass Dawkins nicht widerstehen konnte, dieses krasse Bild seines natürlichen Gegners für eigene Zwecke zu entfremden und aus dem Chronographenhersteller eine unbewusst, ohne Sinn und blind arbeitende Metapher für die natürliche Selektion zu machen.Als ein sich durch das Buch ziehendes Veranschaulichungsobjekt wurde das menschliche Auge gewählt. Dessen Ursprung, Formen und Entwicklungsgeschichte lassen mit den faszinierenden Erkenntnissen, aus welch unerwarteten Kreaturen unsere Fenster zur Welt vor Äonen von Jahren geblickt haben, den Leser vor Erstaunen innehalten. Solange Dawkins in seinem Fachbereich verweilt ist der Stichhaltigkeit seiner Argumentationsketten kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen und man kann diesem 1986 erschienen Werk bis heute wenig gleichwertige Literatur zur Seite stellen. Leider ist auch ein unpassender und mittlerweile mehr als nur veralteter Versuch, anhand der Entwicklung der Computertechnik eine Art von Evolution aufzeigen zu wollen, unter den Beispielen. Das ist ein gut gemeinter Ansatz, die eigenen Thesen noch umfassender erscheinen zu lassen und künstliche Adaptionen in möglichst vielen Themenkreisen zur Erbringung von Belegen heranzuziehen. Es scheitert aber, wie in diesem Fall, zwangsläufig an der unzureichenden Basis und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Thesen, die allzu konstruiert sind und lustigerweise sehr an den Usus der religiösen Fanatiker erinnern. Diese versuchen auch auf Biegen und Brechen ein Konzept über alles zu stülpen.Auch sind die allzu fachspezifisch ausgeführten, eher kurzen Einschübe über Medizin und Genetik zwar richtig, aber im Kontrast zum Rest des Buches anstrengend zu lesen. Man merkt, dass das eigentliche Hauptbetätigungsfeld kurzfristig verlassen wird. Generell täte dem Werk eine kleine Renovierung in Richtung des aktuellen Standes der Forschung sehr gut, damit auch die kritischen Geister des 21. Jahrhunderts sowohl wohlfundierte als auch aktuelle Argumentationen für den hoffentlich irgendwann beendeten, sinnbefreiten Disput mit ignoranten Mitmenschen haben.Trotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte eine epochales Werk, dass in seiner zeitlosen Richtigkeit und dem hehren, dahinterstehenden Anliegen der Aufklärung seinesgleichen sucht. Es zeugt von der Begeisterungsfähigkeit, zu der die berufliche Beschäftigung mit dem Wunder der Entstehung des Lebens werden kann. Ein glücklicher Zufall auch, wenn diese Gabe in die Hände eines noch dazu erzählerisch talentierten Mannes fällt, dessen taktischer Scharfsinn ihm gebietet, der Prävention des Wassers auf die Mühlen seiner Gegner keinen Vorschub zu leisten. Indem er auf einer rein sachlichen Basis jeglicher Art von religiöser Verbrämung, Schöpfungsmythos und Entstehungsmären jegliche Existenzgrundlage entzieht. Jetzt müssen die harten Fakten nur noch ins Bewusstsein der Menschen einfließen. Tröpfchenweise und sehr langsam. Klebrige Tröpfchen."
139,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,5,"The Blind Watchmaker is probably one of the best introductory books on evolution.Dawkins takes his time, explaining step by step how Darwinian evolution works.Dawkins explains at great length, how species that look like a ""complex design"" evolve with accumulating small changes via natural selection, why natural selection is ""blind""; ie. it lacks purpose, how random mutations combined with non-random natural selection is necessary for evolution to take place, and why a ""complex design"" does not necessarily mean a ""good design"" (such as ganglion cells which make the electronic wiring interface between the photocells and the brain, face light directly, whereas photocells sit away from the light source in human eye; compared to octopus eye that has photocells facing the light source).Then the structure of genetic blueprint (DNA) is explained; how DNA archives are being copied from cell to cell and from individual to individual, how copy errors are made, and how mutations can occur.In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity of pure randomness as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the Weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.If you are curious about evolution and choose the best introductory book on the subject this is the one."

Dawkins' style is almost folksy, and not at all the arrogant, condescending style that some reviewers mention. The first chapter, about echolocation in bats, is fascinating. I also enjoyed reading about the different philosophies involved in taxonomy, the classification of species. Some reviewers mention that Dawkins' explanations are ""old hat"", and that the computer simulations are primitive; but they do need to keep in mind that the book is already 25 years old! While I do appreciate the arguments Dawkins puts forward against saltationists and punctuationalists, I found them to be repetitive and boring after a while."

Richard Dawkins has a breathtaking gift for expressive, catchy writing. His handling of illustration and narrative flow like silk. Yet he reminds me of an eloquent 19th century clergyman. His persistent dedication to the high altar of gradualistic explanation, however incredibly improbable, stretches credulity to breaking point. Take for example his extraordinary leap on p.134, para 1, where self-replicating RNA will almost magically come into being - 'all so utterly simple and automatic'. There it is by fiat - Dawkins wishes and so it must be! Abracadabra! Those who have worked in the field know how fasitidious and temperamental RNA and enzymes can be even in the best conditions - yet here it is in rock pool. There are some problems even billions of years won't solve - ask the mathematicians. Or take his extraordinary and uncharacteristically rambling tautology about the peacock's tail, pp 203-206, which boils down to an unexplained discrepancy in tail length (p204) and majority female taste (p205)! This is no cogent defence of evolution of an extraordinarily complex structure, just a mystical will-of-the-wisp-like weaving of concepts to meet his desired end. He reiterates Darwin's acid test of his own theory, on p 91, but if really believed what he wrote there, he would have abandoned neo-Darwinism years ago - I have long since published one very clear example of what he seeks, and his written answer to me was that he couldn't answer it, and there are myriad more. Dawkins is a magician with words, though not as self critical and cautious as he ought to be with scientific argument. "

He considers all the evidence from real life examples, in particular the eye, and buy using a computer program that he wrote, demonstrates how new variants of a species can evolve with very simple initial amendments. Later on in the book he looks at how DNA works, the effects of positive feedback on evolution and the way that mutations works of evolution and selection. He also considers the complexity of trying to document the tree of life.Overall I thought this book was a better read than the previous one I had read. Bearing in mind it was written originally in 1986 most of it is still valid, though we now understand far more than we did then. He can get on his high horse quite often, but thankfully not so much in this book."

More people would be convinced watching an episode of Sagan's Cosmos than slugging through this book. I still remember how Cosmos changed the teenage me. Just remember the high-and-mighty all-smiles Sagan! This preacher, one Ricky Dawkins, with his pompous writing, repeating the same phrases, picking fight with other preachers of the same flock (like Reverend Steven J Gould) and offering the worldview that no other beliefs have a sensible place en este mundo may actually repulse a lot of would-be converts.But what I cannot deny is, I am a sucker for this preacher.

I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:“A physicist certainly doesn’t need Darwinism in order to do physics. He might think that biology is a trivial subject compared with physics. It would follow from this that, in his opinion, Darwinism is of trivial importance to science. But he could not sensibly conclude from this that it is therefore false!”Understanding how Darwinian evolution works can change your attitude toward life and self, substantially. What we learned about Darwin at high school is inadequate. This book provides you with simplified biochemistry, biology, math, physics, and reasoning so that you can easily conceive why Darwinism is the most reasonable answer to world's complexity.I would like to quote another part:“In Darwin’s view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of complex adaptations. For what it is worth, it is also the whole point of this book. For Darwin, any evolution that had to be helped over the jumps by God was not evolution at all. It made a nonsense of the central point of evolution. In the light of this, it is easy to see why Darwin constantly reiterated the gradualness of evolution.”This way of thinking is not just confined to the past. Evolutionary-based science is taking over a lot of fields. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University is a leading one. You can find out more at: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/ "

His arguments follow a defined path but still manage to meander through welcome asides. He uses metaphors and thought experiments well, most of the book was very easy to follow.And what arguments he makes! The probability of miracles, potential precursors of RNA, the importance of gradual change. His goal is to show that it's possible to explain the rise of complexity from a simple world and he spectacularly succeeds.However, I'm likely not the intended audience of this book. He spent more time arguing against alternative theories than I would have liked. I had no idea what Mutationism was before he explained it but it sounded dumb within the first few sentences; he didn't need to spend as many pages dismissing it as he did. Same with the entire chapter on Punctuationism. The first few pages went over some really cool notes on speciation and how some large mutations fit into darwinism that the book wouldn't have been complete without. The rest of the chapter tried to defend darwinism from a media I had never paid attention to in the first place.The last third of the book is worth reading because it contains a few insights. But, finishing it is true drudgery and tarnishes my impression of the book as a whole."

When they say: 'nature designed a creature like this and that.', 'it gave them wings' etc. I was thinking: 'What nonsense is this? It's not possible, nature isn't smart to design a complex creature'. But, I was all wrong.Nature doesn't have to be smart to design something. Living beings don't emerge by luck or chance but from necessity. Small and gradual steps make those creatures climb mount improbable, and they happen to look like highly designed creatures.True knowledge not always resides within your gut instincts and common sense. For example, the book explains that if there's a grand designer, it must have been designed too. Therefore, as the book shows, there is no design, only emergence. Only you need to have an open mind to see the truth. Think logically, you will find the truth."

151,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"I should explain the point about the watchmaker. A SMALL ROCKIf you’re walking along in the countryside and you come across a rock, you don’t say, well, where the hell did that come from and who made it? It’s a rock. No one cares. There’s no notices stuck on trees or printed in local free newspapers anywhere saying “have you seen this rock? Description – roughly three inches by four by three; last seen in the Dorchester area; undistinctive grey colouring; answers to the name of “rock”; reward – please call this number; WE MISS YOU ROCK” . It’s a rock. ON THE OTHER HAND, A GOLD WATCHNow, if you saw a beautiful gold watch on your walk in the countryside, you would say – lo! a watch – I deduce that someone has lost a watch and it is here; also, I furthermore deduce that there must be a God.” Richard Dawkins says that watches, or indeed anything complicated, do not infer the existence of a watchmaker. Or, to use a different analogy, a book, which can be a complicated thing, does not infer the existence of an author. You could say well, here’s a book called The Blind Watchmaker and it says it’s by Richard Dawkins, so we see that Richard Dawkins is the author and he wrote this book, but Richard Dawkins would say NO! it doesn’t, have you not been paying attention, have you been giggling and passing notes in the back row again? EVOLUTION OF THE SEMICOLONWhat happened is that gradually, over many billions of years, language formed, inconceivably slowly, for instance it took ten million years for commas to evolve out of a full stop, and another ten million for the exotic semi-colon to evolve out of the comma. So this book The Blind Watchmaker (like all other books) evolved slowly. We have fossils to prove this. They show the missing links. We have, for instance, copies of the book which are called The Blond Watchmaker dating from the Devonian period – it took several millions of years for the Blond to evolve into the Blind, you see. I read that Mexican paleontologists recently unearthed a copy called The Bland Watchmaker. Going back further , we find all sorts of evolutionary byways that, because of natural selection, died out eventually. One manuscript from the late Pleistocene period which is currently on display at the University of East Anglia shows a strange hybrid between an early version of The Blind Watchmaker and Alice in Wonderland in which the famous teaparty scene features a pterodactyl, a plesiosaur (so very unlikely) and a crazed archaeopteryx. This unviable literary form did not survive, as we know. Natural selection, although brutal from our limited human perspective, explains the evolution of complex things. RELIGION CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY TWILIGHT IS POPULARGod cannot explain why the book species “Stephanie Myers” and “Dan Brown”, for instance, proliferate wildly in many varied habitats, whilst arguably more beautiful forms like Henry James, Proust, and the Golden Tamarin dwindle to the point where human intervention from libraries and literary professors are the only thing keeping them from sinking into oblivion – no, God cannot explain this. But Richard Dawkins (also known as ""Science"") can.Sorry, that should be “Richard Dawkins”."
152,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dawkins loves explaining evolutionary theory, and this is one of his best books. My favourite bit is the section on long-tailed birds (peacocks, etc). From the point of view of simple utility, they are rather baffling. What use could you possibly have for that long, stupid tail?But, as Dawkins keeps reminding us, it's not about survival of the species, or even of the individual, but rather of the gene. Suppose there's a sex-linked male gene that disposes towards long tails, and a sex-linked female gene that disposes towards finding long tails attractive. A child born of a union between two individuals carrying these genes will be likely to have both of them. Hence, if it's male, it'll have a long tail, and if it's female it will prefer males with long tails. If this combination becomes common, long-tailed males will have a larger and larger advantage in terms of being preferred by females. Tails will lengthen until the practical downside (being unable to fly, avoid predators, etc) counterbalances the upside of efficiently attracting potential mates.I read this, and suddenly looked at supermodels in a new light. God, they're hot! In fact, if they were any hotter they'd be dead. "

Read it for yourself.All his arguments are crystal clear, but he takes extra time to caricature the caricature of Darwinists, pointing out exactly how the ad absurdum argument really works while also elucidating the fine points of what Darwinism IS versus what it is NOT.He steps us through the first third of the book showing us how Selection works: from an energy standpoint, a competition standpoint, and a sexual standpoint... from the basic building blocks of proteins to more and more complex forms of DNA and the combo cells that collect all the wonderful multicellular creations, including bacteria, that eventually wind up creating us. The descriptions are quite beautiful and clear and all the while, we've got all the foundations for life... without Intelligent Design. The argument is simple, of course. If we can explain everything, and I mean everything that is life and physics, then what purpose does adding a superfluous layer to the explanation serve?This is ten years worth of hate mail for the author, people. He has been beset on all sides with genuinely curious and well-meaning seekers of the god-fearing sort and inundated with screaming lunatics telling him he'll burn in hell for his first book, The Selfish Gene, which, by the way, didn't really give a rat's ass about creationism or the people who support it. It just laid out a very cogent theory that fit all the copious mountains of data in biology. And yet, after that point, a Mr. Dawkins who professes not to want or need a PR team or lawyers, decides to put his foot down and tackle the problem that has reared its muti-angled head in his direction and DEFEND Darwinism.He does so beautifully, I might add. Every step of the way, he defines the complaints with due diligence and proceeds to demolish them sonar-producing batlike grace, with light humor, sharp intellect, and sometimes he makes of his opponents an overzealous meal. Can you blame him? Granted, by this point it's only been a decade of Creationist hate. Give it a decade or a decade and a half more before we see a truly flame worthy attack from Mr.Dawkins. I'm looking forward to seeing some of it in his books. I hope it's there and not just in his interviews which I still haven't seen. Alas.Seriously, though, this book is pretty wonderful for its lucid and quoteworthy passages and vivid descriptions of how Darwinism works, from gene level to the kinds of time-spans that can only be described as geological when it comes to real changes in evolution. I particularly loved the fact that he used computer terminology to describe how our genes are nothing more than complex computers. I've heard this before, of course, but the way he laid it out was particularly enlightening.This stuff is pretty damn great. Just from the science viewpoint, even leaving out the whole defense, it's well worth reading and not nearly as acerbic or rabid as certain other mass-produced troll-attacks make him appear. But then again, I've only read one of his later books, the The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, which was just a charming bi-modal description of science versus magical thinking which also happened to ""gently"" draw people away from having to add that extra layer of explanation to reality. :) I guess I'll see what the other books bring, no?"

This must be the most boring of all Dawkins’ books, but I do not want to give up on him till I read ‘The Extended Phenotype’ which just might prove to be the best (scientifically) of all his works. With whole chapters devoted to the driest taxonomy problems and to disproving outdated theories, the book was a massive waste of time once I went past the mildly interesting first half. But, it still provides an opportunity to use Dawkins’ own method of caricature-based argument to paint a caricature of his own positions in ‘The God Delusion’ based on his own vitriolic stands in this book. I will try to examine in detail how Dawkins has betrayed his own principles of scientific grounding and rational rigorousness in The God Delusion by using arguments and structures from this book in the review.

Of course, I got tired of it after a while (but I had to keep going, because I had to read it for a class). He comes up with many different arguments/theories for how evolution/natural selection could occur, many of which are interesting, but I would just rather read a science book rather than a philosophical book on evolution. For instance, I recommend The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner, which shows how scientists study evolution and natural selection in action. "
158,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Two summers ago, I did myself the favor of reading The Selfish Gene. Well, I didn’t quite read it; rather, I listened to Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, narrate the book, as I took long walks in the forest near my house. Incidentally, I think Dawkins (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lalla) has a magnificent voice; it’s a pleasure to hear him speak.  But that’s a matter of taste; what is not a matter of taste is the quality of that book. Agree or disagree with Dawkins, one must admit that The Selfish Gene is a book of the finest quality. Indeed, I must say that I wasn’t quite prepared for how good it was. I was expecting an entertaining book of popular science; what I got was an eloquent, subtle, and powerful book which managed, in a just a couple weeks of long walks, to completely transform my understanding of animal behavior. This book, The Blind Watchmaker—also listened to in a few long walks—is not of the same caliber. But it is quite good. (Well, if it were written by almost anybody except Dawkins himself, I would say it was very good—but I know the heights he can reach.) I know close to nothing about his advocacy of atheism, and frankly I don’t much care, but I think the public has a rare treasure in Dawkins; what other popular biology writer can compare? Dawkins is, to an almost remarkable extent, as much a philosopher as a scientist. This book, as well as his first, is jammed full of thought experiments; Dawkins simply can’t get enough of them. This emphasis on philosophical argumentation allows him, so to speak, to take the reader inside the logic of Darwinism (as well as inside the fuzzy logic of Darwinism’s opponents). He doesn’t simply tell the reader things biologists think—like a reporter sending dispatches from the front lines—but tries to get the layreader to understand exactly why biologists think what they do. As a result, his books can actually be a bit dense and exhausting; but the patient reader is amply rewarded with a deepened understanding. The main reason that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as his first was that Dawkins spends an awful lot of time dealing with contemporary controversies. This was, I believe, a time of the famed ‘Darwin Wars’, when Gould and his followers had highly publicized debates with team Dawkins. Apparently, reporters were very eager to report anything even slightly critical of Darwinian theory—whether it be from taxonomists, paleontologists, or priests—so Dawkins was forced to spend a lot of time on material that, to today’s reader, may be of limited interest. For example, Dawkins becomes almost pedantic in his chapter on punctuated equilibrium, as he argues again and again that Gould is not a ‘true’ saltationist, but only a modified gradualist. Having read Gould, I was personally interested in this; but I would understand if others were not. Perhaps I was not the book’s target audience, as I needed no convincing that Darwinian evolution is both a well-supported and a powerful theory. Nonetheless, Dawkins did manage to clear up some of evolution’s finer point for me. I was particularly excited when (not to take too much credit) Dawkins confirmed a suspicion that I had expressed a few years back, when I was learning about human evolution. I was actually in Kenya, studying with the Leakeys, who—being the Leakeys—had plastic casts of several dozen important hominin fossils in their lab. As my anatomy teacher enjoyed pointing out, the vast majority of hominin fossils for any given species can fit inside a shoebox. Most of the fossils are distorted, broken, or otherwise fragmentary. Yet from these scant remains, paleoanthropologists expend tremendous energy arguing about the hominin family tree. Is this skull cap Homo erectus or Homo habilis? Is this thigh bone from an early homo or a late autralopithecus? Somewhat exasperated by all this ambiguity—about what appeared to me to be a matter of words—I got an idea: what if the idea of ‘species’ itself breaks down in an evolutionary timescale? After all, if we believe that species change via gradual selection one to another, it follows that there must be individuals intermediate between any two given hominin species, and, furthermore, individuals intermediate between the intermediates—and so on. Eureka! Well, it turns out Dawkins (as well as many other, probably) had the very same idea long before; it appears that convergent evolution is even more prevalent among memes than genes. (As a side note, if one believes, like Gould, in punctuated equilibrium, then ‘species’ would still be valid in an evolutionary timescale. Perhaps this is why the paleoanthropologists are still arguing?) I got sidetracked—back to the book. (Speaking of sidetracked, Dawkins is the master of the interesting aside and the lengthy digression; and, even more impressively, he always manages to tie his asides and digressions neatly back into the main theme under discussion.) Well, I’m afraid I don’t have very much more to say, other than this: if you find yourself with a supply of long walks, and need an audiobook as accompaniment, you might as well download Dawkins’s crisp, dry, whispery voice, and deepen your understanding of the flora and fauna around you—whether it be this book or, if you want a real treat, his first."

The Blind Watchmaker turned out to be a very prolific piece. I was baffled by his logical analogies, most excellent examples and extremely engaging vernacular. In this work, one learns much about the evolutionary adaptations of numerous species, of which the sonar technology of baths, dolphins and other mammals seemed most shocking.His reasoning of what constitutes miracles, probability theory and reasoning behind the drawback of the Lamark's theory of acquired characteristics is exceptionally enticing. The book should be a required high-school reading. A very, very high recommendation."
160,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7503511-seth-hanson,4,"At the time, this was a tough book for me to read. Considering the way I was raised - in a heavily religious atmosphere - it was hard for me to accept the theory of evolution. However, Dawkins very clearly lays out the theory in a way that anyone can understand if they are willing to open their mind just a little and put in just a little effort. It might be hard to accept but its even harder to dispute. Reality is like that. I think everyone should be required to read this book. "
161,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins’ outstanding The Selfish Gene, my initial impression of The Blind Watchmaker was a bit of a letdown. Dawkins wrote the book to counter creationist thinking, but for a firm believer in Darwinian evolution, his lengthy arguments were unnecessary. However, if Dawkins converted any creationists, I would consider the book a great success. With that said, there were a number of things I did like. Below are some items that caught my attention.Darwin’s concept of gradual evolution overturned the ideas of the catastrophists, who believed the earth and its creatures were formed by sudden drastic changes. Gradual evolution was then challenged by saltationists who believed large genetic changes or macro-mutations could explain much of evolution. A more refined view is that of Stephen Jay Gould who posited punctuated equilibrium. This view recognized varying rates of change, periods of relative stasis with intervals of rapid modification. Keep in mind rapid was on a geologic time scale where 50,000 years is a short time. Thus Gould’s rapid change could still have evolved step-by-step in line with Darwin. The effect of gradualism that struck me was the notion that speciation is contingent on the demise of intermediate individuals. Otherwise one could not tell where one species began and another ended.An upshot of Dawkins’ idea concerns our own connection with our ancestors. The view of chimpanzees as property is made more acceptable because there are no living intermediaries that show our close relationship. This made me wonder how Neanderthals would be treated if some were found alive. Would they be treated like chimpanzees as a different species? Since they are beings who can successfully interbreed with Homo sapiens, would they be given the same rights? Would Christians consider them as individuals with souls that should be saved? I enjoyed Dawkins explanation of the development of the eye in support of gradualism. The book’s title comes from a pre-Darwin argument that if one found a watch, one would have to assume someone made it. The watch is too intricate to have formed naturally. Post-Darwin, like the watch, some held that the eye was so complex as to defy gradual evolution. Dawkins counters. He takes us from a cell with a light sensitive spot to a creature with several such cells that is helped by this sense of light or dark. Then if the light sensitive cells are recessed, the creature can tell the direction of the shadow. If the recess takes on a cuplike shape, this sense of the light’s direction is enhanced. Next if the walls of the cup build up and protrude partially over the cup, a pinhole camera is formed casting an image on the cup. Then, protecting the cup by extending a membrane over the pinhole forms a lens. And so on…I enjoyed the section on bats and echolocation. Dawkins also offers a reasonable explanation of how this seemingly amazing ability could develop. Dolphins, whales and some birds have independently developed this use of sound showing such development not to be quite as extraordinary as one might think. Dawkins pondering of how bats experience this sense I found fascinating. Do the nerve impulses get mapped by the brain to a model similar to the one we experience as vision? And then there is the fish that senses its environment from disruption to an electrical field – elctrolocation. How is this sense perceived? Another intriguing topic was how sexual selection augments natural selection. Unlike environmental factors which wax and wane in intensity, sexual selection forms a positive feedback loop. A female bird’s preference for long tails in her mate not only promotes the gene for long tails but the gene for the desire for long tails. As both genes proliferate tails will grow longer until a practical limit is reached. The bird still has to be an able flyer to survive. One’s mind quickly turns to how this idea works in humans.This book will mean different things to different readers. Every creationist should read it although I suspect few will. For the rest of us, the book is still worthwhile just to get Dawkins’ unique views on odd and end topics, a few of which I covered. If you get bored reading why creationism is wrong, keep in mind the book is written to be easily read, so you can get through those sections quickly."

164,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"...one of my aims in the book is to convey something of the sheer wonder of biological complexity to those whose eyes have not been opened to it. But having built up the mystery, my other main aim is to remove it again by explaining the solution...He managed the above, but I didn't enjoy this as much as The Selfish Gene or The God Delusion. It delves deeper & wanders around Darwinian Evolution & other theories more than I want or need. I hadn't planned to read this since I understood this from his updated edition of The Selfish Gene, but I found it cheap & needed to bump my Amazon order a bit for free shipping. I'm glad I did.My interest varied & I don't think I would have gotten through a text version without a lot of skimming. He addresses issues/controversies in great detail that I didn't know existed nor was I particularly interested in them, so I found the long refutation boring. Often he digressed to build the knowledge & logic which proves why the other theory or claim is wrong. I find about half of these wanderings interesting, while some just beat the particular subject to death. He starts the preface with the following:This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet...So, I was easily able to finish it & even wanted more due to the wonderful narration &, for all that my interest flagged occasionally, there was plenty of fascinating material. That's incredible in light of the age of this book. Quite a few of the science books & articles I've read that were half as old were terribly dated, but Dawkins is dealing with the theory itself, how genetic change & natural selection works over long time periods to build complex systems, instead of details which may have been superseded as technology runs on. Some of the best parts are his opinions of other scientists. He's very fast to give credit to others where it is due. He touts other books & scientists as better or more thorough on some points while he is obviously incensed at a few. At one point, he finished a particularly scathing denunciation & said perhaps he should go out & dig up the garden. He didn't try for a lot of humor, but when it popped up like that it was great. Even when he's peeved, he is polite & gives them their due, though.His ability to simplify & make sense of large numbers & statistical probability is absolutely masterful. It was great to be able to fiddle with the biomorph program. A search for ""Biomorph Breeder Program"" brings up several interesting ones similar to those Dawkins wrote & used. I understood Dawkins' explanations just fine, but actually playing with the program is really worth it. The extreme effects of random change over time are amazing. He's right, we aren't equipped to really understand large numbers or long times, the obvious problem with Young Earth Creationists' beliefs. Of course, those I know somehow make intentional ignorance & a belief in magic a positive attribute. I find their intellectual dishonesty infuriating, especially so when they try to foist them on me, especially in matters of public policy. (Beliefs should remain private. Public discourse requires facts & logic or there can be no reasoning with each other.)One thing I really missed was an explanation of what a species is. (Does he address speciation in The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene?) For years I thought the criterion was simply the ability to breed with the result of fertile offspring. Then I read this article:https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/08...IOW, I was certain in my ignorance & now that I know more, I'm unsure & somewhat bewildered - a good thing from a scientific point of view, but the lack weakened his arguments a bit for me simply because I spent too much time wondering about it. Still, it had no real bearing on his argument even in the chapter on taxonomy. I had no idea taxonomists disagreed so much. I thought I was the only person who made such a muddle of filing. I loved Dawkins' comparisons to library science. It really made a lot more sense of clades & the various other organization schemes.Table of ContentsChapter I: Explaining the very improbableChapter 2: Good designChapter 3: Accumulating small changeChapter 4: Making tracks through animal spaceChapter 5: The power and the archivesChapter 6: Origins and miraclesChapter 7: Constructive evolutionChapter 8: Explosions and spiralsChapter 9: Puncturing punctuationismChapter 10: The one true tree of lifeChapter 11: Doomed rivalsIt was an excellent read & I'll be referring to parts of it the rest of my life. He says that Explaining is a difficult art.

A truly gifted educator."
165,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Analyzes all the various flavors of Darwinist evolution and some competing theoriesRichard Dawkins is a very lucid and intelligent proponent of evolutionary theory and biology when he isn't getting into vitriolic debates with Creationists, which is an exercise in futility for both sides I'd say. I admire him for trying, but frankly trying to use logic and scientific reasoning with people who think the world is 6,000 years old, was created by an all-powerful being who somehow still tolerates Donald Trump's existence, explain the fossil record and dinosaurs as just tests of faith, and really think the universe is centered around planet Earth is truly a tase of time.So it's good to listen to a book that focuses on evolution, but as this book explores some of the subtle variants of evolutionary theory, like gradualists vs punctuationalists, dismantles Lamarkism and Lysenko, it feels a bit turgid at times, and I thought his much later book The Greatest Show on Earth was more interesting and focused on explaining what non-random natural selection means rather than debunking some other ""weak"" theories."
166,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Here are some key points I gathered from this wonderful wonderful book:- According to Dawkins, Darwinism seems to be more in need of advocacy than other branches of science. For instance, many people have no grasp of quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make them oppose the theory as nonsense. This could have religious implications.- One big problem with Darwinism is that everybody thinks he understands it.- The main reason why most people disbelieve Darwinism is that our brains are built to deal with events on radically different timescales from those that characterize evolutionary change. We have no difficulty visualizing processes that take seconds, minutes, years and decades at most to complete, whereas evolutionary change transpires in millions or hundreds of millions of years. - Man-made artifacts like computers and cars are obviously designed for a purpose, yet they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic rather than of flesh and blood. We are designed on a drawing board too, but were our parts assembled by a skilled engineer? the answer is no. When Charles Darwin first explained the matter, many people either wouldn't or couldn't grasp it.- This book is a rebuttal to William Paley's book (Which I have not read yet) called ""natural theology"". In this book which was lauded by Darwin and Dawkins as an inspiring book at the time, Paley uses the analogy of a watch you find in the middle of a road. Upon seeing such a complex apparatus (think of all the cogs and springs and things used in a watch to make it work), you immediately realize that it must be the product of some intelligent design. It makes no sense to declare it just happened to lie there higgledy-piggledy by mere chance or accident. According to Paley a human organ like an eye is much more complex than a watch, therefore like the watch which requires a watchmaker, the eye requires a designer, or does it?- According to Dawkins, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics. Natural selection is the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered. - Natural selection does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight. It can be said to play the role of the watchmaker in nature, but it's the blind watchmaker and hence the title of this book.- Evidence for evolution is overwhelming, in fact it is so overwhelming that even most theologians have given up believing in instantaneous creation. Nevertheless, many of these theologians have tried to smuggle God in by the back door, so to speak, and they allow him some sort of supervisory role over the course that evolution has taken. Dawkins rightly asserts that we cannot disprove beliefs like these. Be that as it may, there are some problems with these beliefs. Firstly, that they are superfluous and, secondly, that they assume the existence of the main thing we want to explain, namely organized complexity. If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guided evolution, that deity must have already been vastly complex in the first place. * This book is a must-read and highly recommended for anyone who is curious about nature. There are many things I learned like idea of arms races, or what mutations are and what's random and nonrandom and so much more. "
167,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"Some parts of the book are quite intriguing while a few chapters carry some ponderousness, leaving me in a bewilderment of what Dawkins intends to convey .Just put aside the evolutionary theory and natural selection and find something amusing. In the female birds' preference for a long tail section, it seems the female birds were in a dominant position in choosing what kind of male birds she likes, be they long tails or short tails. This reminds me of a hilarious essay of James Thurber which he wrote for The New Yorker in 1939 called Courtship Through the Ages.""Surely nothing in the astonishing scheme of life can have nonplused Nature so much as the fact that none of the females of any of the species she created really cared very much for the male, as such. For the past ten million years Nature has been busily inventing ways to make the male attractive to the female, but the whole business of courtship, from the marine annelids up to man, still lumbers heavily along, like a complicated musical comedy. I have been reading the sad and absorbing story in Volume 6 (Cole to Dama) of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In this volume you can learn about cricket, cotton, costume designing, crocodiles, crown jewels, and Coleridge, but none of this subject is so interesting as the Courtship of animals, which recounts the sorrowful lengths to which all males must go to arouse the interest of a lady.” I don't know why this essay suddenly occurred to me but I confess it is Quite an amusing story to read."
168,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"One of the best and most understandable arguments for evolutionary theory and natural selection Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.In the spirit of Darwin, Dawkins argues soundly, comprehensively, in this form of a non-fiction book rhetorically above average and merely correct. In contrast to his later work ""The God Delusion,"" which is so full of polemics, he refrains from doing so. He endeavors to provide factual and scientifically sound reasoning. Thus he celebrates the breathtaking emergence of highly sophisticated systems such as the human body with the apparent enthusiasm of an evolutionary biologist, who burns for his profession and also does not hesitate to lead various theses against the theory of evolution in the field. Mind you only around, to feed his lines, then enjoyable to dismantle piece by piece and to intone on their ruins a song of praise to the fantastic, developmental severe history of life. Ironically, the title of the work also refers to a book by the creationist pioneer William Paley, who wanted to use God in the form of a watchmaker to depict the ""production"" of all worldly components. Understandably, Dawkins could not resist alienating this clear image of his natural adversary for his purposes and turning the chronograph maker into an unconscious, a meaningless and blind metaphor for natural selection. As an illustration, object to be drawn through the book, the human eye was chosen. Its origins, shapes, and history of development make the reader pause in astonishment with fascinating insights into out of which amazing creatures our windows to the world have watched world eons of years ago.As long as Dawkins lingers in his field of study, the soundness of his lines of reasoning can hardly be counteracted, and until nowadays, this literature, which was published in 1986, cannot be compared with the writing of equal value. Unfortunately, an inappropriate and meanwhile more than obsolete attempt to show a kind of evolution based on the development of computer technology is to be found among the examples. This is a well-intentioned approach, to make the own theses seem even more comprehensive and to use artificial adaptations in as many subjects as possible to provide evidence. However, as in this case, it inevitably fails because of the dry basis and comprehensibility of the theses, which are too constructed and, funny enough, very much reminiscent of the custom of religious fanatics. These try to bend over and put a concept on everything. Also, the all specific too, rather short inserts on medicine and genetics are correct, but in contrast to the rest of the book exhausting to read. One notices that the actual primary operating field is left shortly. In general, the work would do a small renovation in the direction of the current state of research very well, so that the critical minds of the 21st century to have both well-founded and current reasoning for the hopefully eventually ended, meaningless dispute with ignorant people. Despite the small points of criticism an epochal work that seeks its equal in its timeless correctness and the significant, underlying concerns of the Enlightenment. It testifies to the enthusiasm to which professional occupation with the miracle of the creation of life can become. A fortunate coincidence, too, when this gift falls into the hands of a talented narrative man whose tactical acumen dictates that he should not encourage the prevention of water on the mills of his opponents. By withdrawing any basis of existence on a purely factual basis of any religious embarrassment, creation myth, and Genesis. Now the hard facts only have to flow into the consciousness of the people. Dropwise and very slowly. Sticky droplets.Eine der besten und verständlichsten Argumentationsführungen für Evolutionstheorie und natürliche SelektionGanz im Sinne Darwins argumentiert Dawkins stichhaltig, umfassend, in dieser Form für ein Sachbuch rhetorisch überdurchschnittlich gut und schlichtweg richtig. Er hält sich dabei im Gegensatz zu seinem späteren Werk Gotteswahn, das vor Polemik nur so strotzt, zurück. Er ist bemüht, eine sachliche und wissenschaftlich fundierte Argumentation abzuliefern. So feiert er die die atemberaubende Entstehung höchst diffiziler Systeme wie dem menschlichen Körper mit der spürbaren Begeisterung eines Evolutionsbiologen, der für sein Metier brennt und auch nicht davor zurückschreckt, verschiedenste Thesen gegen die Evolutionstheorie ins Feld zu führen. Wohlgemerkt nur um, sich selbst geschickt den Ball zuspielend, sie anschließend genussvoll Stück für Stück zu demontieren und auf ihren Trümmern ein Loblied auf die erstaunliche, seriöse Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebens anzustimmen.Ironisch ist auch der Titel des Werks zu verstehen, der sich auf ein Buch des kreationistischen Vordenkers William Paley bezieht, der anhand Gottes in Form eines Uhrmachers die „Fertigung“ sämtlicher weltlicher Bestandteile darstellen wollte. Verständlich, dass Dawkins nicht widerstehen konnte, dieses krasse Bild seines natürlichen Gegners für eigene Zwecke zu entfremden und aus dem Chronographenhersteller eine unbewusst, ohne Sinn und blind arbeitende Metapher für die natürliche Selektion zu machen.Als ein sich durch das Buch ziehendes Veranschaulichungsobjekt wurde das menschliche Auge gewählt. Dessen Ursprung, Formen und Entwicklungsgeschichte lassen mit den faszinierenden Erkenntnissen, aus welch unerwarteten Kreaturen unsere Fenster zur Welt vor Äonen von Jahren geblickt haben, den Leser vor Erstaunen innehalten. Solange Dawkins in seinem Fachbereich verweilt ist der Stichhaltigkeit seiner Argumentationsketten kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen und man kann diesem 1986 erschienen Werk bis heute wenig gleichwertige Literatur zur Seite stellen. Leider ist auch ein unpassender und mittlerweile mehr als nur veralteter Versuch, anhand der Entwicklung der Computertechnik eine Art von Evolution aufzeigen zu wollen, unter den Beispielen. Das ist ein gut gemeinter Ansatz, die eigenen Thesen noch umfassender erscheinen zu lassen und künstliche Adaptionen in möglichst vielen Themenkreisen zur Erbringung von Belegen heranzuziehen. Es scheitert aber, wie in diesem Fall, zwangsläufig an der unzureichenden Basis und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Thesen, die allzu konstruiert sind und lustigerweise sehr an den Usus der religiösen Fanatiker erinnern. Diese versuchen auch auf Biegen und Brechen ein Konzept über alles zu stülpen.Auch sind die allzu fachspezifisch ausgeführten, eher kurzen Einschübe über Medizin und Genetik zwar richtig, aber im Kontrast zum Rest des Buches anstrengend zu lesen. Man merkt, dass das eigentliche Hauptbetätigungsfeld kurzfristig verlassen wird. Generell täte dem Werk eine kleine Renovierung in Richtung des aktuellen Standes der Forschung sehr gut, damit auch die kritischen Geister des 21. Jahrhunderts sowohl wohlfundierte als auch aktuelle Argumentationen für den hoffentlich irgendwann beendeten, sinnbefreiten Disput mit ignoranten Mitmenschen haben.Trotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte eine epochales Werk, dass in seiner zeitlosen Richtigkeit und dem hehren, dahinterstehenden Anliegen der Aufklärung seinesgleichen sucht. Es zeugt von der Begeisterungsfähigkeit, zu der die berufliche Beschäftigung mit dem Wunder der Entstehung des Lebens werden kann. Ein glücklicher Zufall auch, wenn diese Gabe in die Hände eines noch dazu erzählerisch talentierten Mannes fällt, dessen taktischer Scharfsinn ihm gebietet, der Prävention des Wassers auf die Mühlen seiner Gegner keinen Vorschub zu leisten. Indem er auf einer rein sachlichen Basis jeglicher Art von religiöser Verbrämung, Schöpfungsmythos und Entstehungsmären jegliche Existenzgrundlage entzieht. Jetzt müssen die harten Fakten nur noch ins Bewusstsein der Menschen einfließen. Tröpfchenweise und sehr langsam. Klebrige Tröpfchen."
169,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,5,"The Blind Watchmaker is probably one of the best introductory books on evolution.Dawkins takes his time, explaining step by step how Darwinian evolution works.Dawkins explains at great length, how species that look like a ""complex design"" evolve with accumulating small changes via natural selection, why natural selection is ""blind""; ie. it lacks purpose, how random mutations combined with non-random natural selection is necessary for evolution to take place, and why a ""complex design"" does not necessarily mean a ""good design"" (such as ganglion cells which make the electronic wiring interface between the photocells and the brain, face light directly, whereas photocells sit away from the light source in human eye; compared to octopus eye that has photocells facing the light source).Then the structure of genetic blueprint (DNA) is explained; how DNA archives are being copied from cell to cell and from individual to individual, how copy errors are made, and how mutations can occur.In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity of pure randomness as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the Weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.If you are curious about evolution and choose the best introductory book on the subject this is the one."

Dawkins' style is almost folksy, and not at all the arrogant, condescending style that some reviewers mention. The first chapter, about echolocation in bats, is fascinating. I also enjoyed reading about the different philosophies involved in taxonomy, the classification of species. Some reviewers mention that Dawkins' explanations are ""old hat"", and that the computer simulations are primitive; but they do need to keep in mind that the book is already 25 years old! While I do appreciate the arguments Dawkins puts forward against saltationists and punctuationalists, I found them to be repetitive and boring after a while."

Richard Dawkins has a breathtaking gift for expressive, catchy writing. His handling of illustration and narrative flow like silk. Yet he reminds me of an eloquent 19th century clergyman. His persistent dedication to the high altar of gradualistic explanation, however incredibly improbable, stretches credulity to breaking point. Take for example his extraordinary leap on p.134, para 1, where self-replicating RNA will almost magically come into being - 'all so utterly simple and automatic'. There it is by fiat - Dawkins wishes and so it must be! Abracadabra! Those who have worked in the field know how fasitidious and temperamental RNA and enzymes can be even in the best conditions - yet here it is in rock pool. There are some problems even billions of years won't solve - ask the mathematicians. Or take his extraordinary and uncharacteristically rambling tautology about the peacock's tail, pp 203-206, which boils down to an unexplained discrepancy in tail length (p204) and majority female taste (p205)! This is no cogent defence of evolution of an extraordinarily complex structure, just a mystical will-of-the-wisp-like weaving of concepts to meet his desired end. He reiterates Darwin's acid test of his own theory, on p 91, but if really believed what he wrote there, he would have abandoned neo-Darwinism years ago - I have long since published one very clear example of what he seeks, and his written answer to me was that he couldn't answer it, and there are myriad more. Dawkins is a magician with words, though not as self critical and cautious as he ought to be with scientific argument. "

He considers all the evidence from real life examples, in particular the eye, and buy using a computer program that he wrote, demonstrates how new variants of a species can evolve with very simple initial amendments. Later on in the book he looks at how DNA works, the effects of positive feedback on evolution and the way that mutations works of evolution and selection. He also considers the complexity of trying to document the tree of life.Overall I thought this book was a better read than the previous one I had read. Bearing in mind it was written originally in 1986 most of it is still valid, though we now understand far more than we did then. He can get on his high horse quite often, but thankfully not so much in this book."

This preacher, one Ricky Dawkins, with his pompous writing, repeating the same phrases, picking fight with other preachers of the same flock (like Reverend Steven J Gould) and offering the worldview that no other beliefs have a sensible place en este mundo may actually repulse a lot of would-be converts.But what I cannot deny is, I am a sucker for this preacher.

I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:“A physicist certainly doesn’t need Darwinism in order to do physics. He might think that biology is a trivial subject compared with physics. It would follow from this that, in his opinion, Darwinism is of trivial importance to science. But he could not sensibly conclude from this that it is therefore false!”Understanding how Darwinian evolution works can change your attitude toward life and self, substantially. What we learned about Darwin at high school is inadequate. This book provides you with simplified biochemistry, biology, math, physics, and reasoning so that you can easily conceive why Darwinism is the most reasonable answer to world's complexity.I would like to quote another part:“In Darwin’s view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of complex adaptations. For what it is worth, it is also the whole point of this book. For Darwin, any evolution that had to be helped over the jumps by God was not evolution at all. It made a nonsense of the central point of evolution. In the light of this, it is easy to see why Darwin constantly reiterated the gradualness of evolution.”This way of thinking is not just confined to the past. Evolutionary-based science is taking over a lot of fields. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University is a leading one. You can find out more at: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/ "
175,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27367650-brian-cloutier,4,"The good part: Dawkins is a great writer. His style is very conversational and the book very quotable. His arguments follow a defined path but still manage to meander through welcome asides. He uses metaphors and thought experiments well, most of the book was very easy to follow.And what arguments he makes! The probability of miracles, potential precursors of RNA, the importance of gradual change. His goal is to show that it's possible to explain the rise of complexity from a simple world and he spectacularly succeeds.However, I'm likely not the intended audience of this book. He spent more time arguing against alternative theories than I would have liked. I had no idea what Mutationism was before he explained it but it sounded dumb within the first few sentences; he didn't need to spend as many pages dismissing it as he did. Same with the entire chapter on Punctuationism. The first few pages went over some really cool notes on speciation and how some large mutations fit into darwinism that the book wouldn't have been complete without. The rest of the chapter tried to defend darwinism from a media I had never paid attention to in the first place.The last third of the book is worth reading because it contains a few insights. But, finishing it is true drudgery and tarnishes my impression of the book as a whole."

When they say: 'nature designed a creature like this and that.', 'it gave them wings' etc. I was thinking: 'What nonsense is this? It's not possible, nature isn't smart to design a complex creature'. But, I was all wrong.Nature doesn't have to be smart to design something. Living beings don't emerge by luck or chance but from necessity. Small and gradual steps make those creatures climb mount improbable, and they happen to look like highly designed creatures.True knowledge not always resides within your gut instincts and common sense. For example, the book explains that if there's a grand designer, it must have been designed too. Therefore, as the book shows, there is no design, only emergence. Only you need to have an open mind to see the truth. Think logically, you will find the truth."

181,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,3,"I should explain the point about the watchmaker. A SMALL ROCKIf you’re walking along in the countryside and you come across a rock, you don’t say, well, where the hell did that come from and who made it? It’s a rock. No one cares. There’s no notices stuck on trees or printed in local free newspapers anywhere saying “have you seen this rock? Description – roughly three inches by four by three; last seen in the Dorchester area; undistinctive grey colouring; answers to the name of “rock”; reward – please call this number; WE MISS YOU ROCK” . It’s a rock. ON THE OTHER HAND, A GOLD WATCHNow, if you saw a beautiful gold watch on your walk in the countryside, you would say – lo! a watch – I deduce that someone has lost a watch and it is here; also, I furthermore deduce that there must be a God.” Richard Dawkins says that watches, or indeed anything complicated, do not infer the existence of a watchmaker. Or, to use a different analogy, a book, which can be a complicated thing, does not infer the existence of an author. You could say well, here’s a book called The Blind Watchmaker and it says it’s by Richard Dawkins, so we see that Richard Dawkins is the author and he wrote this book, but Richard Dawkins would say NO! it doesn’t, have you not been paying attention, have you been giggling and passing notes in the back row again? EVOLUTION OF THE SEMICOLONWhat happened is that gradually, over many billions of years, language formed, inconceivably slowly, for instance it took ten million years for commas to evolve out of a full stop, and another ten million for the exotic semi-colon to evolve out of the comma. So this book The Blind Watchmaker (like all other books) evolved slowly. We have fossils to prove this. They show the missing links. We have, for instance, copies of the book which are called The Blond Watchmaker dating from the Devonian period – it took several millions of years for the Blond to evolve into the Blind, you see. I read that Mexican paleontologists recently unearthed a copy called The Bland Watchmaker. Going back further , we find all sorts of evolutionary byways that, because of natural selection, died out eventually. One manuscript from the late Pleistocene period which is currently on display at the University of East Anglia shows a strange hybrid between an early version of The Blind Watchmaker and Alice in Wonderland in which the famous teaparty scene features a pterodactyl, a plesiosaur (so very unlikely) and a crazed archaeopteryx. This unviable literary form did not survive, as we know. Natural selection, although brutal from our limited human perspective, explains the evolution of complex things. RELIGION CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY TWILIGHT IS POPULARGod cannot explain why the book species “Stephanie Myers” and “Dan Brown”, for instance, proliferate wildly in many varied habitats, whilst arguably more beautiful forms like Henry James, Proust, and the Golden Tamarin dwindle to the point where human intervention from libraries and literary professors are the only thing keeping them from sinking into oblivion – no, God cannot explain this. But Richard Dawkins (also known as ""Science"") can.Sorry, that should be “Richard Dawkins”."
182,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dawkins loves explaining evolutionary theory, and this is one of his best books. My favourite bit is the section on long-tailed birds (peacocks, etc). From the point of view of simple utility, they are rather baffling. What use could you possibly have for that long, stupid tail?But, as Dawkins keeps reminding us, it's not about survival of the species, or even of the individual, but rather of the gene. Suppose there's a sex-linked male gene that disposes towards long tails, and a sex-linked female gene that disposes towards finding long tails attractive. A child born of a union between two individuals carrying these genes will be likely to have both of them. Hence, if it's male, it'll have a long tail, and if it's female it will prefer males with long tails. If this combination becomes common, long-tailed males will have a larger and larger advantage in terms of being preferred by females. Tails will lengthen until the practical downside (being unable to fly, avoid predators, etc) counterbalances the upside of efficiently attracting potential mates.I read this, and suddenly looked at supermodels in a new light. God, they're hot! In fact, if they were any hotter they'd be dead. "
183,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"As the title's extension spells out, this is a definitive (as of '87) rebuttal against all comers in favor of Darwinism, but don't let my saying so prove it. Read it for yourself.All his arguments are crystal clear, but he takes extra time to caricature the caricature of Darwinists, pointing out exactly how the ad absurdum argument really works while also elucidating the fine points of what Darwinism IS versus what it is NOT.He steps us through the first third of the book showing us how Selection works: from an energy standpoint, a competition standpoint, and a sexual standpoint... from the basic building blocks of proteins to more and more complex forms of DNA and the combo cells that collect all the wonderful multicellular creations, including bacteria, that eventually wind up creating us. The descriptions are quite beautiful and clear and all the while, we've got all the foundations for life... without Intelligent Design. The argument is simple, of course. If we can explain everything, and I mean everything that is life and physics, then what purpose does adding a superfluous layer to the explanation serve?This is ten years worth of hate mail for the author, people. He has been beset on all sides with genuinely curious and well-meaning seekers of the god-fearing sort and inundated with screaming lunatics telling him he'll burn in hell for his first book, The Selfish Gene, which, by the way, didn't really give a rat's ass about creationism or the people who support it. It just laid out a very cogent theory that fit all the copious mountains of data in biology. And yet, after that point, a Mr. Dawkins who professes not to want or need a PR team or lawyers, decides to put his foot down and tackle the problem that has reared its muti-angled head in his direction and DEFEND Darwinism.He does so beautifully, I might add. Every step of the way, he defines the complaints with due diligence and proceeds to demolish them sonar-producing batlike grace, with light humor, sharp intellect, and sometimes he makes of his opponents an overzealous meal. Can you blame him? Granted, by this point it's only been a decade of Creationist hate. Give it a decade or a decade and a half more before we see a truly flame worthy attack from Mr.Dawkins. I'm looking forward to seeing some of it in his books. I hope it's there and not just in his interviews which I still haven't seen. Alas.Seriously, though, this book is pretty wonderful for its lucid and quoteworthy passages and vivid descriptions of how Darwinism works, from gene level to the kinds of time-spans that can only be described as geological when it comes to real changes in evolution. I particularly loved the fact that he used computer terminology to describe how our genes are nothing more than complex computers. I've heard this before, of course, but the way he laid it out was particularly enlightening.This stuff is pretty damn great. Just from the science viewpoint, even leaving out the whole defense, it's well worth reading and not nearly as acerbic or rabid as certain other mass-produced troll-attacks make him appear. But then again, I've only read one of his later books, the The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, which was just a charming bi-modal description of science versus magical thinking which also happened to ""gently"" draw people away from having to add that extra layer of explanation to reality. :) I guess I'll see what the other books bring, no?"

This must be the most boring of all Dawkins’ books, but I do not want to give up on him till I read ‘The Extended Phenotype’ which just might prove to be the best (scientifically) of all his works. With whole chapters devoted to the driest taxonomy problems and to disproving outdated theories, the book was a massive waste of time once I went past the mildly interesting first half. But, it still provides an opportunity to use Dawkins’ own method of caricature-based argument to paint a caricature of his own positions in ‘The God Delusion’ based on his own vitriolic stands in this book. I will try to examine in detail how Dawkins has betrayed his own principles of scientific grounding and rational rigorousness in The God Delusion by using arguments and structures from this book in the review.

Of course, I got tired of it after a while (but I had to keep going, because I had to read it for a class). He comes up with many different arguments/theories for how evolution/natural selection could occur, many of which are interesting, but I would just rather read a science book rather than a philosophical book on evolution. For instance, I recommend The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner, which shows how scientists study evolution and natural selection in action. "
188,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Two summers ago, I did myself the favor of reading The Selfish Gene. Well, I didn’t quite read it; rather, I listened to Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, narrate the book, as I took long walks in the forest near my house. Incidentally, I think Dawkins (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lalla) has a magnificent voice; it’s a pleasure to hear him speak.  But that’s a matter of taste; what is not a matter of taste is the quality of that book. Agree or disagree with Dawkins, one must admit that The Selfish Gene is a book of the finest quality. Indeed, I must say that I wasn’t quite prepared for how good it was. I was expecting an entertaining book of popular science; what I got was an eloquent, subtle, and powerful book which managed, in a just a couple weeks of long walks, to completely transform my understanding of animal behavior. This book, The Blind Watchmaker—also listened to in a few long walks—is not of the same caliber. But it is quite good. (Well, if it were written by almost anybody except Dawkins himself, I would say it was very good—but I know the heights he can reach.) I know close to nothing about his advocacy of atheism, and frankly I don’t much care, but I think the public has a rare treasure in Dawkins; what other popular biology writer can compare? Dawkins is, to an almost remarkable extent, as much a philosopher as a scientist. This book, as well as his first, is jammed full of thought experiments; Dawkins simply can’t get enough of them. This emphasis on philosophical argumentation allows him, so to speak, to take the reader inside the logic of Darwinism (as well as inside the fuzzy logic of Darwinism’s opponents). He doesn’t simply tell the reader things biologists think—like a reporter sending dispatches from the front lines—but tries to get the layreader to understand exactly why biologists think what they do. As a result, his books can actually be a bit dense and exhausting; but the patient reader is amply rewarded with a deepened understanding. The main reason that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as his first was that Dawkins spends an awful lot of time dealing with contemporary controversies. This was, I believe, a time of the famed ‘Darwin Wars’, when Gould and his followers had highly publicized debates with team Dawkins. Apparently, reporters were very eager to report anything even slightly critical of Darwinian theory—whether it be from taxonomists, paleontologists, or priests—so Dawkins was forced to spend a lot of time on material that, to today’s reader, may be of limited interest. For example, Dawkins becomes almost pedantic in his chapter on punctuated equilibrium, as he argues again and again that Gould is not a ‘true’ saltationist, but only a modified gradualist. Having read Gould, I was personally interested in this; but I would understand if others were not. Perhaps I was not the book’s target audience, as I needed no convincing that Darwinian evolution is both a well-supported and a powerful theory. Nonetheless, Dawkins did manage to clear up some of evolution’s finer point for me. I was particularly excited when (not to take too much credit) Dawkins confirmed a suspicion that I had expressed a few years back, when I was learning about human evolution. I was actually in Kenya, studying with the Leakeys, who—being the Leakeys—had plastic casts of several dozen important hominin fossils in their lab. As my anatomy teacher enjoyed pointing out, the vast majority of hominin fossils for any given species can fit inside a shoebox. Most of the fossils are distorted, broken, or otherwise fragmentary. Yet from these scant remains, paleoanthropologists expend tremendous energy arguing about the hominin family tree. Is this skull cap Homo erectus or Homo habilis? Is this thigh bone from an early homo or a late autralopithecus? Somewhat exasperated by all this ambiguity—about what appeared to me to be a matter of words—I got an idea: what if the idea of ‘species’ itself breaks down in an evolutionary timescale? After all, if we believe that species change via gradual selection one to another, it follows that there must be individuals intermediate between any two given hominin species, and, furthermore, individuals intermediate between the intermediates—and so on. Eureka! Well, it turns out Dawkins (as well as many other, probably) had the very same idea long before; it appears that convergent evolution is even more prevalent among memes than genes. (As a side note, if one believes, like Gould, in punctuated equilibrium, then ‘species’ would still be valid in an evolutionary timescale. Perhaps this is why the paleoanthropologists are still arguing?) I got sidetracked—back to the book. (Speaking of sidetracked, Dawkins is the master of the interesting aside and the lengthy digression; and, even more impressively, he always manages to tie his asides and digressions neatly back into the main theme under discussion.) Well, I’m afraid I don’t have very much more to say, other than this: if you find yourself with a supply of long walks, and need an audiobook as accompaniment, you might as well download Dawkins’s crisp, dry, whispery voice, and deepen your understanding of the flora and fauna around you—whether it be this book or, if you want a real treat, his first."
189,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd,5,"Dawkins is one of my top picks for the most articulate, engaging and proficient scientists I've read to date. The Blind Watchmaker turned out to be a very prolific piece. I was baffled by his logical analogies, most excellent examples and extremely engaging vernacular. In this work, one learns much about the evolutionary adaptations of numerous species, of which the sonar technology of baths, dolphins and other mammals seemed most shocking.His reasoning of what constitutes miracles, probability theory and reasoning behind the drawback of the Lamark's theory of acquired characteristics is exceptionally enticing. The book should be a required high-school reading. A very, very high recommendation."
190,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7503511-seth-hanson,4,"At the time, this was a tough book for me to read. Considering the way I was raised - in a heavily religious atmosphere - it was hard for me to accept the theory of evolution. However, Dawkins very clearly lays out the theory in a way that anyone can understand if they are willing to open their mind just a little and put in just a little effort. It might be hard to accept but its even harder to dispute. Reality is like that. I think everyone should be required to read this book. "
191,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins’ outstanding The Selfish Gene, my initial impression of The Blind Watchmaker was a bit of a letdown. Dawkins wrote the book to counter creationist thinking, but for a firm believer in Darwinian evolution, his lengthy arguments were unnecessary. However, if Dawkins converted any creationists, I would consider the book a great success. With that said, there were a number of things I did like. Below are some items that caught my attention.Darwin’s concept of gradual evolution overturned the ideas of the catastrophists, who believed the earth and its creatures were formed by sudden drastic changes. Gradual evolution was then challenged by saltationists who believed large genetic changes or macro-mutations could explain much of evolution. A more refined view is that of Stephen Jay Gould who posited punctuated equilibrium. This view recognized varying rates of change, periods of relative stasis with intervals of rapid modification. Keep in mind rapid was on a geologic time scale where 50,000 years is a short time. Thus Gould’s rapid change could still have evolved step-by-step in line with Darwin. The effect of gradualism that struck me was the notion that speciation is contingent on the demise of intermediate individuals. Otherwise one could not tell where one species began and another ended.An upshot of Dawkins’ idea concerns our own connection with our ancestors. The view of chimpanzees as property is made more acceptable because there are no living intermediaries that show our close relationship. This made me wonder how Neanderthals would be treated if some were found alive. Would they be treated like chimpanzees as a different species? Since they are beings who can successfully interbreed with Homo sapiens, would they be given the same rights? Would Christians consider them as individuals with souls that should be saved? I enjoyed Dawkins explanation of the development of the eye in support of gradualism. The book’s title comes from a pre-Darwin argument that if one found a watch, one would have to assume someone made it. The watch is too intricate to have formed naturally. Post-Darwin, like the watch, some held that the eye was so complex as to defy gradual evolution. Dawkins counters. He takes us from a cell with a light sensitive spot to a creature with several such cells that is helped by this sense of light or dark. Then if the light sensitive cells are recessed, the creature can tell the direction of the shadow. If the recess takes on a cuplike shape, this sense of the light’s direction is enhanced. Next if the walls of the cup build up and protrude partially over the cup, a pinhole camera is formed casting an image on the cup. Then, protecting the cup by extending a membrane over the pinhole forms a lens. And so on…I enjoyed the section on bats and echolocation. Dawkins also offers a reasonable explanation of how this seemingly amazing ability could develop. Dolphins, whales and some birds have independently developed this use of sound showing such development not to be quite as extraordinary as one might think. Dawkins pondering of how bats experience this sense I found fascinating. Do the nerve impulses get mapped by the brain to a model similar to the one we experience as vision? And then there is the fish that senses its environment from disruption to an electrical field – elctrolocation. How is this sense perceived? Another intriguing topic was how sexual selection augments natural selection. Unlike environmental factors which wax and wane in intensity, sexual selection forms a positive feedback loop. A female bird’s preference for long tails in her mate not only promotes the gene for long tails but the gene for the desire for long tails. As both genes proliferate tails will grow longer until a practical limit is reached. The bird still has to be an able flyer to survive. One’s mind quickly turns to how this idea works in humans.This book will mean different things to different readers. Every creationist should read it although I suspect few will. For the rest of us, the book is still worthwhile just to get Dawkins’ unique views on odd and end topics, a few of which I covered. If you get bored reading why creationism is wrong, keep in mind the book is written to be easily read, so you can get through those sections quickly."

He addresses issues/controversies in great detail that I didn't know existed nor was I particularly interested in them, so I found the long refutation boring. Often he digressed to build the knowledge & logic which proves why the other theory or claim is wrong. I find about half of these wanderings interesting, while some just beat the particular subject to death. He starts the preface with the following:This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet...So, I was easily able to finish it & even wanted more due to the wonderful narration &, for all that my interest flagged occasionally, there was plenty of fascinating material. That's incredible in light of the age of this book. Quite a few of the science books & articles I've read that were half as old were terribly dated, but Dawkins is dealing with the theory itself, how genetic change & natural selection works over long time periods to build complex systems, instead of details which may have been superseded as technology runs on. Some of the best parts are his opinions of other scientists. He's very fast to give credit to others where it is due. He touts other books & scientists as better or more thorough on some points while he is obviously incensed at a few. At one point, he finished a particularly scathing denunciation & said perhaps he should go out & dig up the garden. He didn't try for a lot of humor, but when it popped up like that it was great. Even when he's peeved, he is polite & gives them their due, though.His ability to simplify & make sense of large numbers & statistical probability is absolutely masterful. It was great to be able to fiddle with the biomorph program. A search for ""Biomorph Breeder Program"" brings up several interesting ones similar to those Dawkins wrote & used. I understood Dawkins' explanations just fine, but actually playing with the program is really worth it. The extreme effects of random change over time are amazing. He's right, we aren't equipped to really understand large numbers or long times, the obvious problem with Young Earth Creationists' beliefs. Of course, those I know somehow make intentional ignorance & a belief in magic a positive attribute. I find their intellectual dishonesty infuriating, especially so when they try to foist them on me, especially in matters of public policy. (Beliefs should remain private. Public discourse requires facts & logic or there can be no reasoning with each other.)One thing I really missed was an explanation of what a species is. (Does he address speciation in The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene?) For years I thought the criterion was simply the ability to breed with the result of fertile offspring. Then I read this article:https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/08...IOW, I was certain in my ignorance & now that I know more, I'm unsure & somewhat bewildered - a good thing from a scientific point of view, but the lack weakened his arguments a bit for me simply because I spent too much time wondering about it. Still, it had no real bearing on his argument even in the chapter on taxonomy. I had no idea taxonomists disagreed so much. I thought I was the only person who made such a muddle of filing. I loved Dawkins' comparisons to library science. It really made a lot more sense of clades & the various other organization schemes.Table of ContentsChapter I: Explaining the very improbableChapter 2: Good designChapter 3: Accumulating small changeChapter 4: Making tracks through animal spaceChapter 5: The power and the archivesChapter 6: Origins and miraclesChapter 7: Constructive evolutionChapter 8: Explosions and spiralsChapter 9: Puncturing punctuationismChapter 10: The one true tree of lifeChapter 11: Doomed rivalsIt was an excellent read & I'll be referring to parts of it the rest of my life. He says that Explaining is a difficult art. You can explain something so that your reader understands the words; and you can explain something so that the reader feels it in the marrow of his bones... He manages the latter most of the time. A truly gifted educator."
195,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Analyzes all the various flavors of Darwinist evolution and some competing theoriesRichard Dawkins is a very lucid and intelligent proponent of evolutionary theory and biology when he isn't getting into vitriolic debates with Creationists, which is an exercise in futility for both sides I'd say. I admire him for trying, but frankly trying to use logic and scientific reasoning with people who think the world is 6,000 years old, was created by an all-powerful being who somehow still tolerates Donald Trump's existence, explain the fossil record and dinosaurs as just tests of faith, and really think the universe is centered around planet Earth is truly a tase of time.So it's good to listen to a book that focuses on evolution, but as this book explores some of the subtle variants of evolutionary theory, like gradualists vs punctuationalists, dismantles Lamarkism and Lysenko, it feels a bit turgid at times, and I thought his much later book The Greatest Show on Earth was more interesting and focused on explaining what non-random natural selection means rather than debunking some other ""weak"" theories."
196,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Here are some key points I gathered from this wonderful wonderful book:- According to Dawkins, Darwinism seems to be more in need of advocacy than other branches of science. For instance, many people have no grasp of quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make them oppose the theory as nonsense. This could have religious implications.- One big problem with Darwinism is that everybody thinks he understands it.- The main reason why most people disbelieve Darwinism is that our brains are built to deal with events on radically different timescales from those that characterize evolutionary change. We have no difficulty visualizing processes that take seconds, minutes, years and decades at most to complete, whereas evolutionary change transpires in millions or hundreds of millions of years. - Man-made artifacts like computers and cars are obviously designed for a purpose, yet they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic rather than of flesh and blood. We are designed on a drawing board too, but were our parts assembled by a skilled engineer? the answer is no. When Charles Darwin first explained the matter, many people either wouldn't or couldn't grasp it.- This book is a rebuttal to William Paley's book (Which I have not read yet) called ""natural theology"". In this book which was lauded by Darwin and Dawkins as an inspiring book at the time, Paley uses the analogy of a watch you find in the middle of a road. Upon seeing such a complex apparatus (think of all the cogs and springs and things used in a watch to make it work), you immediately realize that it must be the product of some intelligent design. It makes no sense to declare it just happened to lie there higgledy-piggledy by mere chance or accident. According to Paley a human organ like an eye is much more complex than a watch, therefore like the watch which requires a watchmaker, the eye requires a designer, or does it?- According to Dawkins, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics. Natural selection is the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered. - Natural selection does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight. It can be said to play the role of the watchmaker in nature, but it's the blind watchmaker and hence the title of this book.- Evidence for evolution is overwhelming, in fact it is so overwhelming that even most theologians have given up believing in instantaneous creation. Nevertheless, many of these theologians have tried to smuggle God in by the back door, so to speak, and they allow him some sort of supervisory role over the course that evolution has taken. Dawkins rightly asserts that we cannot disprove beliefs like these. Be that as it may, there are some problems with these beliefs. Firstly, that they are superfluous and, secondly, that they assume the existence of the main thing we want to explain, namely organized complexity. If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guided evolution, that deity must have already been vastly complex in the first place. * This book is a must-read and highly recommended for anyone who is curious about nature. There are many things I learned like idea of arms races, or what mutations are and what's random and nonrandom and so much more. "
197,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"Some parts of the book are quite intriguing while a few chapters carry some ponderousness, leaving me in a bewilderment of what Dawkins intends to convey .Just put aside the evolutionary theory and natural selection and find something amusing. In the female birds' preference for a long tail section, it seems the female birds were in a dominant position in choosing what kind of male birds she likes, be they long tails or short tails. This reminds me of a hilarious essay of James Thurber which he wrote for The New Yorker in 1939 called Courtship Through the Ages.""Surely nothing in the astonishing scheme of life can have nonplused Nature so much as the fact that none of the females of any of the species she created really cared very much for the male, as such. For the past ten million years Nature has been busily inventing ways to make the male attractive to the female, but the whole business of courtship, from the marine annelids up to man, still lumbers heavily along, like a complicated musical comedy. I have been reading the sad and absorbing story in Volume 6 (Cole to Dama) of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In this volume you can learn about cricket, cotton, costume designing, crocodiles, crown jewels, and Coleridge, but none of this subject is so interesting as the Courtship of animals, which recounts the sorrowful lengths to which all males must go to arouse the interest of a lady.” I don't know why this essay suddenly occurred to me but I confess it is Quite an amusing story to read."
198,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"One of the best and most understandable arguments for evolutionary theory and natural selection Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.In the spirit of Darwin, Dawkins argues soundly, comprehensively, in this form of a non-fiction book rhetorically above average and merely correct. In contrast to his later work ""The God Delusion,"" which is so full of polemics, he refrains from doing so. He endeavors to provide factual and scientifically sound reasoning. Thus he celebrates the breathtaking emergence of highly sophisticated systems such as the human body with the apparent enthusiasm of an evolutionary biologist, who burns for his profession and also does not hesitate to lead various theses against the theory of evolution in the field. Mind you only around, to feed his lines, then enjoyable to dismantle piece by piece and to intone on their ruins a song of praise to the fantastic, developmental severe history of life. Ironically, the title of the work also refers to a book by the creationist pioneer William Paley, who wanted to use God in the form of a watchmaker to depict the ""production"" of all worldly components. Understandably, Dawkins could not resist alienating this clear image of his natural adversary for his purposes and turning the chronograph maker into an unconscious, a meaningless and blind metaphor for natural selection. As an illustration, object to be drawn through the book, the human eye was chosen. Its origins, shapes, and history of development make the reader pause in astonishment with fascinating insights into out of which amazing creatures our windows to the world have watched world eons of years ago.As long as Dawkins lingers in his field of study, the soundness of his lines of reasoning can hardly be counteracted, and until nowadays, this literature, which was published in 1986, cannot be compared with the writing of equal value. Unfortunately, an inappropriate and meanwhile more than obsolete attempt to show a kind of evolution based on the development of computer technology is to be found among the examples. This is a well-intentioned approach, to make the own theses seem even more comprehensive and to use artificial adaptations in as many subjects as possible to provide evidence. However, as in this case, it inevitably fails because of the dry basis and comprehensibility of the theses, which are too constructed and, funny enough, very much reminiscent of the custom of religious fanatics. These try to bend over and put a concept on everything. Also, the all specific too, rather short inserts on medicine and genetics are correct, but in contrast to the rest of the book exhausting to read. One notices that the actual primary operating field is left shortly. In general, the work would do a small renovation in the direction of the current state of research very well, so that the critical minds of the 21st century to have both well-founded and current reasoning for the hopefully eventually ended, meaningless dispute with ignorant people. Despite the small points of criticism an epochal work that seeks its equal in its timeless correctness and the significant, underlying concerns of the Enlightenment. It testifies to the enthusiasm to which professional occupation with the miracle of the creation of life can become. A fortunate coincidence, too, when this gift falls into the hands of a talented narrative man whose tactical acumen dictates that he should not encourage the prevention of water on the mills of his opponents. By withdrawing any basis of existence on a purely factual basis of any religious embarrassment, creation myth, and Genesis. Now the hard facts only have to flow into the consciousness of the people. Dropwise and very slowly. Sticky droplets.Eine der besten und verständlichsten Argumentationsführungen für Evolutionstheorie und natürliche SelektionGanz im Sinne Darwins argumentiert Dawkins stichhaltig, umfassend, in dieser Form für ein Sachbuch rhetorisch überdurchschnittlich gut und schlichtweg richtig. Er hält sich dabei im Gegensatz zu seinem späteren Werk Gotteswahn, das vor Polemik nur so strotzt, zurück. Er ist bemüht, eine sachliche und wissenschaftlich fundierte Argumentation abzuliefern. So feiert er die die atemberaubende Entstehung höchst diffiziler Systeme wie dem menschlichen Körper mit der spürbaren Begeisterung eines Evolutionsbiologen, der für sein Metier brennt und auch nicht davor zurückschreckt, verschiedenste Thesen gegen die Evolutionstheorie ins Feld zu führen. Wohlgemerkt nur um, sich selbst geschickt den Ball zuspielend, sie anschließend genussvoll Stück für Stück zu demontieren und auf ihren Trümmern ein Loblied auf die erstaunliche, seriöse Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebens anzustimmen.Ironisch ist auch der Titel des Werks zu verstehen, der sich auf ein Buch des kreationistischen Vordenkers William Paley bezieht, der anhand Gottes in Form eines Uhrmachers die „Fertigung“ sämtlicher weltlicher Bestandteile darstellen wollte. Verständlich, dass Dawkins nicht widerstehen konnte, dieses krasse Bild seines natürlichen Gegners für eigene Zwecke zu entfremden und aus dem Chronographenhersteller eine unbewusst, ohne Sinn und blind arbeitende Metapher für die natürliche Selektion zu machen.Als ein sich durch das Buch ziehendes Veranschaulichungsobjekt wurde das menschliche Auge gewählt. Dessen Ursprung, Formen und Entwicklungsgeschichte lassen mit den faszinierenden Erkenntnissen, aus welch unerwarteten Kreaturen unsere Fenster zur Welt vor Äonen von Jahren geblickt haben, den Leser vor Erstaunen innehalten. Solange Dawkins in seinem Fachbereich verweilt ist der Stichhaltigkeit seiner Argumentationsketten kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen und man kann diesem 1986 erschienen Werk bis heute wenig gleichwertige Literatur zur Seite stellen. Leider ist auch ein unpassender und mittlerweile mehr als nur veralteter Versuch, anhand der Entwicklung der Computertechnik eine Art von Evolution aufzeigen zu wollen, unter den Beispielen. Das ist ein gut gemeinter Ansatz, die eigenen Thesen noch umfassender erscheinen zu lassen und künstliche Adaptionen in möglichst vielen Themenkreisen zur Erbringung von Belegen heranzuziehen. Es scheitert aber, wie in diesem Fall, zwangsläufig an der unzureichenden Basis und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Thesen, die allzu konstruiert sind und lustigerweise sehr an den Usus der religiösen Fanatiker erinnern. Diese versuchen auch auf Biegen und Brechen ein Konzept über alles zu stülpen.Auch sind die allzu fachspezifisch ausgeführten, eher kurzen Einschübe über Medizin und Genetik zwar richtig, aber im Kontrast zum Rest des Buches anstrengend zu lesen. Man merkt, dass das eigentliche Hauptbetätigungsfeld kurzfristig verlassen wird. Generell täte dem Werk eine kleine Renovierung in Richtung des aktuellen Standes der Forschung sehr gut, damit auch die kritischen Geister des 21. Jahrhunderts sowohl wohlfundierte als auch aktuelle Argumentationen für den hoffentlich irgendwann beendeten, sinnbefreiten Disput mit ignoranten Mitmenschen haben.Trotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte eine epochales Werk, dass in seiner zeitlosen Richtigkeit und dem hehren, dahinterstehenden Anliegen der Aufklärung seinesgleichen sucht. Es zeugt von der Begeisterungsfähigkeit, zu der die berufliche Beschäftigung mit dem Wunder der Entstehung des Lebens werden kann. Ein glücklicher Zufall auch, wenn diese Gabe in die Hände eines noch dazu erzählerisch talentierten Mannes fällt, dessen taktischer Scharfsinn ihm gebietet, der Prävention des Wassers auf die Mühlen seiner Gegner keinen Vorschub zu leisten. Indem er auf einer rein sachlichen Basis jeglicher Art von religiöser Verbrämung, Schöpfungsmythos und Entstehungsmären jegliche Existenzgrundlage entzieht. Jetzt müssen die harten Fakten nur noch ins Bewusstsein der Menschen einfließen. Tröpfchenweise und sehr langsam. Klebrige Tröpfchen."
199,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,5,"The Blind Watchmaker is probably one of the best introductory books on evolution.Dawkins takes his time, explaining step by step how Darwinian evolution works.Dawkins explains at great length, how species that look like a ""complex design"" evolve with accumulating small changes via natural selection, why natural selection is ""blind""; ie. it lacks purpose, how random mutations combined with non-random natural selection is necessary for evolution to take place, and why a ""complex design"" does not necessarily mean a ""good design"" (such as ganglion cells which make the electronic wiring interface between the photocells and the brain, face light directly, whereas photocells sit away from the light source in human eye; compared to octopus eye that has photocells facing the light source).Then the structure of genetic blueprint (DNA) is explained; how DNA archives are being copied from cell to cell and from individual to individual, how copy errors are made, and how mutations can occur.In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity of pure randomness as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the Weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.If you are curious about evolution and choose the best introductory book on the subject this is the one."
200,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I enjoyed this book very much, despite the difficulty of reading the very small typeface. Dawkins' style is almost folksy, and not at all the arrogant, condescending style that some reviewers mention. The first chapter, about echolocation in bats, is fascinating. I also enjoyed reading about the different philosophies involved in taxonomy, the classification of species. Some reviewers mention that Dawkins' explanations are ""old hat"", and that the computer simulations are primitive; but they do need to keep in mind that the book is already 25 years old! While I do appreciate the arguments Dawkins puts forward against saltationists and punctuationalists, I found them to be repetitive and boring after a while."
201,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/490192-charles,2,"Enchantingly beautiful fiction, 23 Mar 2007  Musings of a fideist (a materialistic fideist). Richard Dawkins has a breathtaking gift for expressive, catchy writing. His handling of illustration and narrative flow like silk. Yet he reminds me of an eloquent 19th century clergyman. His persistent dedication to the high altar of gradualistic explanation, however incredibly improbable, stretches credulity to breaking point. Take for example his extraordinary leap on p.134, para 1, where self-replicating RNA will almost magically come into being - 'all so utterly simple and automatic'. There it is by fiat - Dawkins wishes and so it must be! Abracadabra! Those who have worked in the field know how fasitidious and temperamental RNA and enzymes can be even in the best conditions - yet here it is in rock pool. There are some problems even billions of years won't solve - ask the mathematicians. Or take his extraordinary and uncharacteristically rambling tautology about the peacock's tail, pp 203-206, which boils down to an unexplained discrepancy in tail length (p204) and majority female taste (p205)! This is no cogent defence of evolution of an extraordinarily complex structure, just a mystical will-of-the-wisp-like weaving of concepts to meet his desired end. He reiterates Darwin's acid test of his own theory, on p 91, but if really believed what he wrote there, he would have abandoned neo-Darwinism years ago - I have long since published one very clear example of what he seeks, and his written answer to me was that he couldn't answer it, and there are myriad more. Dawkins is a magician with words, though not as self critical and cautious as he ought to be with scientific argument. "
202,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"I have only ever read one other Dawkins book before, The God Delusion, and really didn't like the style or attitude of the writing, so was not completely looking forward to this one.The primary aim of the book is to look at all the evidence and theories that make up the Darwinian theory of evolution and natural selection. He considers all the evidence from real life examples, in particular the eye, and buy using a computer program that he wrote, demonstrates how new variants of a species can evolve with very simple initial amendments. Later on in the book he looks at how DNA works, the effects of positive feedback on evolution and the way that mutations works of evolution and selection. He also considers the complexity of trying to document the tree of life.Overall I thought this book was a better read than the previous one I had read. Bearing in mind it was written originally in 1986 most of it is still valid, though we now understand far more than we did then. He can get on his high horse quite often, but thankfully not so much in this book."

More people would be convinced watching an episode of Sagan's Cosmos than slugging through this book. I still remember how Cosmos changed the teenage me. Just remember the high-and-mighty all-smiles Sagan! This preacher, one Ricky Dawkins, with his pompous writing, repeating the same phrases, picking fight with other preachers of the same flock (like Reverend Steven J Gould) and offering the worldview that no other beliefs have a sensible place en este mundo may actually repulse a lot of would-be converts.But what I cannot deny is, I am a sucker for this preacher. Through and through."

I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:“A physicist certainly doesn’t need Darwinism in order to do physics. He might think that biology is a trivial subject compared with physics. It would follow from this that, in his opinion, Darwinism is of trivial importance to science. But he could not sensibly conclude from this that it is therefore false!”Understanding how Darwinian evolution works can change your attitude toward life and self, substantially. What we learned about Darwin at high school is inadequate. This book provides you with simplified biochemistry, biology, math, physics, and reasoning so that you can easily conceive why Darwinism is the most reasonable answer to world's complexity.I would like to quote another part:“In Darwin’s view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of complex adaptations. For what it is worth, it is also the whole point of this book. For Darwin, any evolution that had to be helped over the jumps by God was not evolution at all. It made a nonsense of the central point of evolution. In the light of this, it is easy to see why Darwin constantly reiterated the gradualness of evolution.”This way of thinking is not just confined to the past. Evolutionary-based science is taking over a lot of fields. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University is a leading one. You can find out more at: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/ "
205,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27367650-brian-cloutier,4,"The good part: Dawkins is a great writer. His style is very conversational and the book very quotable. His arguments follow a defined path but still manage to meander through welcome asides. He uses metaphors and thought experiments well, most of the book was very easy to follow.And what arguments he makes! The probability of miracles, potential precursors of RNA, the importance of gradual change. His goal is to show that it's possible to explain the rise of complexity from a simple world and he spectacularly succeeds.However, I'm likely not the intended audience of this book. He spent more time arguing against alternative theories than I would have liked. I had no idea what Mutationism was before he explained it but it sounded dumb within the first few sentences; he didn't need to spend as many pages dismissing it as he did. Same with the entire chapter on Punctuationism. The first few pages went over some really cool notes on speciation and how some large mutations fit into darwinism that the book wouldn't have been complete without. The rest of the chapter tried to defend darwinism from a media I had never paid attention to in the first place.The last third of the book is worth reading because it contains a few insights. But, finishing it is true drudgery and tarnishes my impression of the book as a whole."

When they say: 'nature designed a creature like this and that.', 'it gave them wings' etc. I was thinking: 'What nonsense is this? It's not possible, nature isn't smart to design a complex creature'. But, I was all wrong.Nature doesn't have to be smart to design something. Living beings don't emerge by luck or chance but from necessity. Small and gradual steps make those creatures climb mount improbable, and they happen to look like highly designed creatures.True knowledge not always resides within your gut instincts and common sense. For example, the book explains that if there's a grand designer, it must have been designed too. Therefore, as the book shows, there is no design, only emergence. Only you need to have an open mind to see the truth. Think logically, you will find the truth."

With a contagious passion and a load of patience (because, quite frankly, you need a massive amount of it to face the rubbish circulating on such topics!) the biologist is once again enchanting us. In fact, we feel like a little child holding his hand, admiring all the wonders he's pointing at: nature is wonderful as it is; don't be afraid to toss God (or whatever you want to call it) in the bin.

A SMALL ROCKIf you’re walking along in the countryside and you come across a rock, you don’t say, well, where the hell did that come from and who made it? It’s a rock. No one cares. There’s no notices stuck on trees or printed in local free newspapers anywhere saying “have you seen this rock? Description – roughly three inches by four by three; last seen in the Dorchester area; undistinctive grey colouring; answers to the name of “rock”; reward – please call this number; WE MISS YOU ROCK” .

ON THE OTHER HAND, A GOLD WATCHNow, if you saw a beautiful gold watch on your walk in the countryside, you would say – lo! a watch – I deduce that someone has lost a watch and it is here; also, I furthermore deduce that there must be a God.” Richard Dawkins says that watches, or indeed anything complicated, do not infer the existence of a watchmaker. Or, to use a different analogy, a book, which can be a complicated thing, does not infer the existence of an author. You could say well, here’s a book called The Blind Watchmaker and it says it’s by Richard Dawkins, so we see that Richard Dawkins is the author and he wrote this book, but Richard Dawkins would say NO! it doesn’t, have you not been paying attention, have you been giggling and passing notes in the back row again?

So this book The Blind Watchmaker (like all other books) evolved slowly. We have fossils to prove this. They show the missing links. We have, for instance, copies of the book which are called The Blond Watchmaker dating from the Devonian period – it took several millions of years for the Blond to evolve into the Blind, you see. I read that Mexican paleontologists recently unearthed a copy called The Bland Watchmaker. Going back further , we find all sorts of evolutionary byways that, because of natural selection, died out eventually. One manuscript from the late Pleistocene period which is currently on display at the University of East Anglia shows a strange hybrid between an early version of The Blind Watchmaker and Alice in Wonderland in which the famous teaparty scene features a pterodactyl, a plesiosaur (so very unlikely) and a crazed archaeopteryx. This unviable literary form did not survive, as we know. Natural selection, although brutal from our limited human perspective, explains the evolution of complex things. RELIGION CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY TWILIGHT IS POPULARGod cannot explain why the book species “Stephanie Myers” and “Dan Brown”, for instance, proliferate wildly in many varied habitats, whilst arguably more beautiful forms like Henry James, Proust, and the Golden Tamarin dwindle to the point where human intervention from libraries and literary professors are the only thing keeping them from sinking into oblivion – no, God cannot explain this. But Richard Dawkins (also known as ""Science"") can.Sorry, that should be “Richard Dawkins”."
212,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dawkins loves explaining evolutionary theory, and this is one of his best books. My favourite bit is the section on long-tailed birds (peacocks, etc). From the point of view of simple utility, they are rather baffling. What use could you possibly have for that long, stupid tail?But, as Dawkins keeps reminding us, it's not about survival of the species, or even of the individual, but rather of the gene. Suppose there's a sex-linked male gene that disposes towards long tails, and a sex-linked female gene that disposes towards finding long tails attractive. A child born of a union between two individuals carrying these genes will be likely to have both of them. Hence, if it's male, it'll have a long tail, and if it's female it will prefer males with long tails. If this combination becomes common, long-tailed males will have a larger and larger advantage in terms of being preferred by females. Tails will lengthen until the practical downside (being unable to fly, avoid predators, etc) counterbalances the upside of efficiently attracting potential mates.I read this, and suddenly looked at supermodels in a new light. God, they're hot! In fact, if they were any hotter they'd be dead. "
213,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"As the title's extension spells out, this is a definitive (as of '87) rebuttal against all comers in favor of Darwinism, but don't let my saying so prove it. Read it for yourself.All his arguments are crystal clear, but he takes extra time to caricature the caricature of Darwinists, pointing out exactly how the ad absurdum argument really works while also elucidating the fine points of what Darwinism IS versus what it is NOT.He steps us through the first third of the book showing us how Selection works: from an energy standpoint, a competition standpoint, and a sexual standpoint... from the basic building blocks of proteins to more and more complex forms of DNA and the combo cells that collect all the wonderful multicellular creations, including bacteria, that eventually wind up creating us. The descriptions are quite beautiful and clear and all the while, we've got all the foundations for life... without Intelligent Design. The argument is simple, of course. If we can explain everything, and I mean everything that is life and physics, then what purpose does adding a superfluous layer to the explanation serve?This is ten years worth of hate mail for the author, people. He has been beset on all sides with genuinely curious and well-meaning seekers of the god-fearing sort and inundated with screaming lunatics telling him he'll burn in hell for his first book, The Selfish Gene, which, by the way, didn't really give a rat's ass about creationism or the people who support it. It just laid out a very cogent theory that fit all the copious mountains of data in biology. And yet, after that point, a Mr. Dawkins who professes not to want or need a PR team or lawyers, decides to put his foot down and tackle the problem that has reared its muti-angled head in his direction and DEFEND Darwinism.He does so beautifully, I might add. Every step of the way, he defines the complaints with due diligence and proceeds to demolish them sonar-producing batlike grace, with light humor, sharp intellect, and sometimes he makes of his opponents an overzealous meal. Can you blame him? Granted, by this point it's only been a decade of Creationist hate. Give it a decade or a decade and a half more before we see a truly flame worthy attack from Mr.Dawkins. I'm looking forward to seeing some of it in his books. I hope it's there and not just in his interviews which I still haven't seen. Alas.Seriously, though, this book is pretty wonderful for its lucid and quoteworthy passages and vivid descriptions of how Darwinism works, from gene level to the kinds of time-spans that can only be described as geological when it comes to real changes in evolution. I particularly loved the fact that he used computer terminology to describe how our genes are nothing more than complex computers. I've heard this before, of course, but the way he laid it out was particularly enlightening.This stuff is pretty damn great. Just from the science viewpoint, even leaving out the whole defense, it's well worth reading and not nearly as acerbic or rabid as certain other mass-produced troll-attacks make him appear. But then again, I've only read one of his later books, the The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, which was just a charming bi-modal description of science versus magical thinking which also happened to ""gently"" draw people away from having to add that extra layer of explanation to reality. :) I guess I'll see what the other books bring, no?"
214,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,2,"It is a good thing that Dawkins himself takes the trouble to think about which chapters of his books will be of vanishing interest in the near future. Of course, he turned out to be more accurate than he must have wished for. This must be the most boring of all Dawkins’ books, but I do not want to give up on him till I read ‘The Extended Phenotype’ which just might prove to be the best (scientifically) of all his works. With whole chapters devoted to the driest taxonomy problems and to disproving outdated theories, the book was a massive waste of time once I went past the mildly interesting first half. But, it still provides an opportunity to use Dawkins’ own method of caricature-based argument to paint a caricature of his own positions in ‘The God Delusion’ based on his own vitriolic stands in this book. I will try to examine in detail how Dawkins has betrayed his own principles of scientific grounding and rational rigorousness in The God Delusion by using arguments and structures from this book in the review. Hopefully that will happen by tomorrow..."

But I guess its complexity is pretty relevant to the level of articulation many have. However, it was a great read and made me think more about the topic. "
216,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1402463-mostephl,5,"wow and double wow. i read this through and turned back to p.1 to read it again. blind watchmaker has been amazingly influential in the way i think about just about everything- the world, existence, life forms, physics- down to the micro, myself and my craft. it's sent chills down my spine, made me euphoric and angry. the first for finally addressing questions that have long been in my mind (but receive no echo in society as i've known it), the second for the willful repression of information and large-scale institutionalized dumb-down that is the public school system i grew up in. it makes me want to cry to think that i didn't learn about evolution until i already had a master's degree. i am learning now, though, largely through dawkins, stephen j. gould and others who've been able to bring the complexities of this subject to the laypeople. still angry that whatever my daughter learns about evolution, she'll have to learn from me, a social scientist and by no means an authority. nonetheless, in a college classroom if her professor asks if anyone's heard of darwin, her answer will be a resounding, ""yeah!!"". small victory, but something.p.s. there's a great, great BBC documentary on Galapagos- highly worth checking out. "
217,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34331-laura,2,"This book was okay, but since I already am convinced evolution occurs by natural selection, I felt like he was not preaching to the choir, but trying to convince the choir. Of course, I got tired of it after a while (but I had to keep going, because I had to read it for a class). He comes up with many different arguments/theories for how evolution/natural selection could occur, many of which are interesting, but I would just rather read a science book rather than a philosophical book on evolution. For instance, I recommend The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner, which shows how scientists study evolution and natural selection in action. "
218,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Two summers ago, I did myself the favor of reading The Selfish Gene. Well, I didn’t quite read it; rather, I listened to Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, narrate the book, as I took long walks in the forest near my house. Incidentally, I think Dawkins (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lalla) has a magnificent voice; it’s a pleasure to hear him speak.  But that’s a matter of taste; what is not a matter of taste is the quality of that book. Agree or disagree with Dawkins, one must admit that The Selfish Gene is a book of the finest quality. Indeed, I must say that I wasn’t quite prepared for how good it was. I was expecting an entertaining book of popular science; what I got was an eloquent, subtle, and powerful book which managed, in a just a couple weeks of long walks, to completely transform my understanding of animal behavior. This book, The Blind Watchmaker—also listened to in a few long walks—is not of the same caliber. But it is quite good. (Well, if it were written by almost anybody except Dawkins himself, I would say it was very good—but I know the heights he can reach.) I know close to nothing about his advocacy of atheism, and frankly I don’t much care, but I think the public has a rare treasure in Dawkins; what other popular biology writer can compare? Dawkins is, to an almost remarkable extent, as much a philosopher as a scientist. This book, as well as his first, is jammed full of thought experiments; Dawkins simply can’t get enough of them. This emphasis on philosophical argumentation allows him, so to speak, to take the reader inside the logic of Darwinism (as well as inside the fuzzy logic of Darwinism’s opponents). He doesn’t simply tell the reader things biologists think—like a reporter sending dispatches from the front lines—but tries to get the layreader to understand exactly why biologists think what they do. As a result, his books can actually be a bit dense and exhausting; but the patient reader is amply rewarded with a deepened understanding. The main reason that this book wasn’t as enjoyable as his first was that Dawkins spends an awful lot of time dealing with contemporary controversies. This was, I believe, a time of the famed ‘Darwin Wars’, when Gould and his followers had highly publicized debates with team Dawkins. Apparently, reporters were very eager to report anything even slightly critical of Darwinian theory—whether it be from taxonomists, paleontologists, or priests—so Dawkins was forced to spend a lot of time on material that, to today’s reader, may be of limited interest. For example, Dawkins becomes almost pedantic in his chapter on punctuated equilibrium, as he argues again and again that Gould is not a ‘true’ saltationist, but only a modified gradualist. Having read Gould, I was personally interested in this; but I would understand if others were not. Perhaps I was not the book’s target audience, as I needed no convincing that Darwinian evolution is both a well-supported and a powerful theory. Nonetheless, Dawkins did manage to clear up some of evolution’s finer point for me. I was particularly excited when (not to take too much credit) Dawkins confirmed a suspicion that I had expressed a few years back, when I was learning about human evolution. I was actually in Kenya, studying with the Leakeys, who—being the Leakeys—had plastic casts of several dozen important hominin fossils in their lab. As my anatomy teacher enjoyed pointing out, the vast majority of hominin fossils for any given species can fit inside a shoebox. Most of the fossils are distorted, broken, or otherwise fragmentary. Yet from these scant remains, paleoanthropologists expend tremendous energy arguing about the hominin family tree. Is this skull cap Homo erectus or Homo habilis? Is this thigh bone from an early homo or a late autralopithecus? Somewhat exasperated by all this ambiguity—about what appeared to me to be a matter of words—I got an idea: what if the idea of ‘species’ itself breaks down in an evolutionary timescale? After all, if we believe that species change via gradual selection one to another, it follows that there must be individuals intermediate between any two given hominin species, and, furthermore, individuals intermediate between the intermediates—and so on. Eureka! Well, it turns out Dawkins (as well as many other, probably) had the very same idea long before; it appears that convergent evolution is even more prevalent among memes than genes. (As a side note, if one believes, like Gould, in punctuated equilibrium, then ‘species’ would still be valid in an evolutionary timescale. Perhaps this is why the paleoanthropologists are still arguing?) I got sidetracked—back to the book. (Speaking of sidetracked, Dawkins is the master of the interesting aside and the lengthy digression; and, even more impressively, he always manages to tie his asides and digressions neatly back into the main theme under discussion.) Well, I’m afraid I don’t have very much more to say, other than this: if you find yourself with a supply of long walks, and need an audiobook as accompaniment, you might as well download Dawkins’s crisp, dry, whispery voice, and deepen your understanding of the flora and fauna around you—whether it be this book or, if you want a real treat, his first."
219,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd,5,"Dawkins is one of my top picks for the most articulate, engaging and proficient scientists I've read to date. The Blind Watchmaker turned out to be a very prolific piece. I was baffled by his logical analogies, most excellent examples and extremely engaging vernacular. In this work, one learns much about the evolutionary adaptations of numerous species, of which the sonar technology of baths, dolphins and other mammals seemed most shocking.His reasoning of what constitutes miracles, probability theory and reasoning behind the drawback of the Lamark's theory of acquired characteristics is exceptionally enticing. The book should be a required high-school reading. A very, very high recommendation."
220,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7503511-seth-hanson,4,"At the time, this was a tough book for me to read. Considering the way I was raised - in a heavily religious atmosphere - it was hard for me to accept the theory of evolution. However, Dawkins very clearly lays out the theory in a way that anyone can understand if they are willing to open their mind just a little and put in just a little effort. It might be hard to accept but its even harder to dispute. Reality is like that. I think everyone should be required to read this book. "
221,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins’ outstanding The Selfish Gene, my initial impression of The Blind Watchmaker was a bit of a letdown. Dawkins wrote the book to counter creationist thinking, but for a firm believer in Darwinian evolution, his lengthy arguments were unnecessary. However, if Dawkins converted any creationists, I would consider the book a great success. With that said, there were a number of things I did like. Below are some items that caught my attention.Darwin’s concept of gradual evolution overturned the ideas of the catastrophists, who believed the earth and its creatures were formed by sudden drastic changes. Gradual evolution was then challenged by saltationists who believed large genetic changes or macro-mutations could explain much of evolution. A more refined view is that of Stephen Jay Gould who posited punctuated equilibrium. This view recognized varying rates of change, periods of relative stasis with intervals of rapid modification. Keep in mind rapid was on a geologic time scale where 50,000 years is a short time. Thus Gould’s rapid change could still have evolved step-by-step in line with Darwin. The effect of gradualism that struck me was the notion that speciation is contingent on the demise of intermediate individuals. Otherwise one could not tell where one species began and another ended.An upshot of Dawkins’ idea concerns our own connection with our ancestors. The view of chimpanzees as property is made more acceptable because there are no living intermediaries that show our close relationship. This made me wonder how Neanderthals would be treated if some were found alive. Would they be treated like chimpanzees as a different species? Since they are beings who can successfully interbreed with Homo sapiens, would they be given the same rights? Would Christians consider them as individuals with souls that should be saved? I enjoyed Dawkins explanation of the development of the eye in support of gradualism. The book’s title comes from a pre-Darwin argument that if one found a watch, one would have to assume someone made it. The watch is too intricate to have formed naturally. Post-Darwin, like the watch, some held that the eye was so complex as to defy gradual evolution. Dawkins counters. He takes us from a cell with a light sensitive spot to a creature with several such cells that is helped by this sense of light or dark. Then if the light sensitive cells are recessed, the creature can tell the direction of the shadow. If the recess takes on a cuplike shape, this sense of the light’s direction is enhanced. Next if the walls of the cup build up and protrude partially over the cup, a pinhole camera is formed casting an image on the cup. Then, protecting the cup by extending a membrane over the pinhole forms a lens. And so on…I enjoyed the section on bats and echolocation. Dawkins also offers a reasonable explanation of how this seemingly amazing ability could develop. Dolphins, whales and some birds have independently developed this use of sound showing such development not to be quite as extraordinary as one might think. Dawkins pondering of how bats experience this sense I found fascinating. Do the nerve impulses get mapped by the brain to a model similar to the one we experience as vision? And then there is the fish that senses its environment from disruption to an electrical field – elctrolocation. How is this sense perceived? Another intriguing topic was how sexual selection augments natural selection. Unlike environmental factors which wax and wane in intensity, sexual selection forms a positive feedback loop. A female bird’s preference for long tails in her mate not only promotes the gene for long tails but the gene for the desire for long tails. As both genes proliferate tails will grow longer until a practical limit is reached. The bird still has to be an able flyer to survive. One’s mind quickly turns to how this idea works in humans.This book will mean different things to different readers. Every creationist should read it although I suspect few will. For the rest of us, the book is still worthwhile just to get Dawkins’ unique views on odd and end topics, a few of which I covered. If you get bored reading why creationism is wrong, keep in mind the book is written to be easily read, so you can get through those sections quickly."
222,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"This book is a more nail in the coffin of creationism.It develops the darvinian theory of evolution,change and selection,but at a more deep level than the original Darwins theory,the deeper level of molecular biology and molecular genetics,subjects this unknown in the Darwins time as the quantum electrodinamics was unknown in the Maxwells time but explains at a deeper level the electromagnetic fenomenology.The first chapters explains the incredible aparition of wonderful organs as the human eye as a long series of very small changes and steps as consecuence of mutations by chance each step selected between many others possibles by efficacy and supervivence along unimaginable for the human mind long period of time,millions of years,as the human mind is unable of make a idea of what a light year is in distance.He also explains the deep work of evolution making software models resembling the working of genes.In the mid chapters underlined the mportance of the fact of the cooperation of the genes in the evolution throught the relation with epigenetics and embriology,also explains the concept of punctuated equilibrium as a long standby followed by a fast evolution and it important role in the peciation and the existence of molecular clocks for measuring times and distances in evolutionary processes.In the final chapters confronts the different schools of taxonomy in clasifyng species and discuss the other failed schools of explanation of the origen of the species : creationism,saltationism,Lamarckism ( inherited features ) and some other.A excelent book in giving another perspetive of darvinian evolution,full of subtle concepts and reasonings that dismantle the creationism and other wrong theories."

224,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"...one of my aims in the book is to convey something of the sheer wonder of biological complexity to those whose eyes have not been opened to it. But having built up the mystery, my other main aim is to remove it again by explaining the solution...He managed the above, but I didn't enjoy this as much as The Selfish Gene or The God Delusion. It delves deeper & wanders around Darwinian Evolution & other theories more than I want or need. I hadn't planned to read this since I understood this from his updated edition of The Selfish Gene, but I found it cheap & needed to bump my Amazon order a bit for free shipping. I'm glad I did.My interest varied & I don't think I would have gotten through a text version without a lot of skimming. He addresses issues/controversies in great detail that I didn't know existed nor was I particularly interested in them, so I found the long refutation boring. Often he digressed to build the knowledge & logic which proves why the other theory or claim is wrong. I find about half of these wanderings interesting, while some just beat the particular subject to death. He starts the preface with the following:This book is written in the conviction that our own existence once presented the greatest of all mysteries, but that it is a mystery no longer because it is solved. Darwin and Wallace solved it, though we shall continue to add footnotes to their solution for a while yet...So, I was easily able to finish it & even wanted more due to the wonderful narration &, for all that my interest flagged occasionally, there was plenty of fascinating material. That's incredible in light of the age of this book. Quite a few of the science books & articles I've read that were half as old were terribly dated, but Dawkins is dealing with the theory itself, how genetic change & natural selection works over long time periods to build complex systems, instead of details which may have been superseded as technology runs on. Some of the best parts are his opinions of other scientists. He's very fast to give credit to others where it is due. He touts other books & scientists as better or more thorough on some points while he is obviously incensed at a few. At one point, he finished a particularly scathing denunciation & said perhaps he should go out & dig up the garden. He didn't try for a lot of humor, but when it popped up like that it was great. Even when he's peeved, he is polite & gives them their due, though.His ability to simplify & make sense of large numbers & statistical probability is absolutely masterful. It was great to be able to fiddle with the biomorph program. A search for ""Biomorph Breeder Program"" brings up several interesting ones similar to those Dawkins wrote & used. I understood Dawkins' explanations just fine, but actually playing with the program is really worth it. The extreme effects of random change over time are amazing. He's right, we aren't equipped to really understand large numbers or long times, the obvious problem with Young Earth Creationists' beliefs. Of course, those I know somehow make intentional ignorance & a belief in magic a positive attribute. I find their intellectual dishonesty infuriating, especially so when they try to foist them on me, especially in matters of public policy. (Beliefs should remain private. Public discourse requires facts & logic or there can be no reasoning with each other.)One thing I really missed was an explanation of what a species is. (Does he address speciation in The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene?) For years I thought the criterion was simply the ability to breed with the result of fertile offspring. Then I read this article:https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/08...IOW, I was certain in my ignorance & now that I know more, I'm unsure & somewhat bewildered - a good thing from a scientific point of view, but the lack weakened his arguments a bit for me simply because I spent too much time wondering about it. Still, it had no real bearing on his argument even in the chapter on taxonomy. I had no idea taxonomists disagreed so much. I thought I was the only person who made such a muddle of filing. I loved Dawkins' comparisons to library science. It really made a lot more sense of clades & the various other organization schemes.Table of ContentsChapter I: Explaining the very improbableChapter 2: Good designChapter 3: Accumulating small changeChapter 4: Making tracks through animal spaceChapter 5: The power and the archivesChapter 6: Origins and miraclesChapter 7: Constructive evolutionChapter 8: Explosions and spiralsChapter 9: Puncturing punctuationismChapter 10: The one true tree of lifeChapter 11: Doomed rivalsIt was an excellent read & I'll be referring to parts of it the rest of my life. He says that Explaining is a difficult art. You can explain something so that your reader understands the words; and you can explain something so that the reader feels it in the marrow of his bones... He manages the latter most of the time. A truly gifted educator."
225,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Analyzes all the various flavors of Darwinist evolution and some competing theoriesRichard Dawkins is a very lucid and intelligent proponent of evolutionary theory and biology when he isn't getting into vitriolic debates with Creationists, which is an exercise in futility for both sides I'd say. I admire him for trying, but frankly trying to use logic and scientific reasoning with people who think the world is 6,000 years old, was created by an all-powerful being who somehow still tolerates Donald Trump's existence, explain the fossil record and dinosaurs as just tests of faith, and really think the universe is centered around planet Earth is truly a tase of time.So it's good to listen to a book that focuses on evolution, but as this book explores some of the subtle variants of evolutionary theory, like gradualists vs punctuationalists, dismantles Lamarkism and Lysenko, it feels a bit turgid at times, and I thought his much later book The Greatest Show on Earth was more interesting and focused on explaining what non-random natural selection means rather than debunking some other ""weak"" theories."
226,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Here are some key points I gathered from this wonderful wonderful book:- According to Dawkins, Darwinism seems to be more in need of advocacy than other branches of science. For instance, many people have no grasp of quantum mechanics, but that doesn't make them oppose the theory as nonsense. This could have religious implications.- One big problem with Darwinism is that everybody thinks he understands it.- The main reason why most people disbelieve Darwinism is that our brains are built to deal with events on radically different timescales from those that characterize evolutionary change. We have no difficulty visualizing processes that take seconds, minutes, years and decades at most to complete, whereas evolutionary change transpires in millions or hundreds of millions of years. - Man-made artifacts like computers and cars are obviously designed for a purpose, yet they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic rather than of flesh and blood. We are designed on a drawing board too, but were our parts assembled by a skilled engineer? the answer is no. When Charles Darwin first explained the matter, many people either wouldn't or couldn't grasp it.- This book is a rebuttal to William Paley's book (Which I have not read yet) called ""natural theology"". In this book which was lauded by Darwin and Dawkins as an inspiring book at the time, Paley uses the analogy of a watch you find in the middle of a road. Upon seeing such a complex apparatus (think of all the cogs and springs and things used in a watch to make it work), you immediately realize that it must be the product of some intelligent design. It makes no sense to declare it just happened to lie there higgledy-piggledy by mere chance or accident. According to Paley a human organ like an eye is much more complex than a watch, therefore like the watch which requires a watchmaker, the eye requires a designer, or does it?- According to Dawkins, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind forces of physics. Natural selection is the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered. - Natural selection does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight. It can be said to play the role of the watchmaker in nature, but it's the blind watchmaker and hence the title of this book.- Evidence for evolution is overwhelming, in fact it is so overwhelming that even most theologians have given up believing in instantaneous creation. Nevertheless, many of these theologians have tried to smuggle God in by the back door, so to speak, and they allow him some sort of supervisory role over the course that evolution has taken. Dawkins rightly asserts that we cannot disprove beliefs like these. Be that as it may, there are some problems with these beliefs. Firstly, that they are superfluous and, secondly, that they assume the existence of the main thing we want to explain, namely organized complexity. If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guided evolution, that deity must have already been vastly complex in the first place. * This book is a must-read and highly recommended for anyone who is curious about nature. There are many things I learned like idea of arms races, or what mutations are and what's random and nonrandom and so much more. "
227,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung,3,"Some parts of the book are quite intriguing while a few chapters carry some ponderousness, leaving me in a bewilderment of what Dawkins intends to convey .Just put aside the evolutionary theory and natural selection and find something amusing. In the female birds' preference for a long tail section, it seems the female birds were in a dominant position in choosing what kind of male birds she likes, be they long tails or short tails. This reminds me of a hilarious essay of James Thurber which he wrote for The New Yorker in 1939 called Courtship Through the Ages.""Surely nothing in the astonishing scheme of life can have nonplused Nature so much as the fact that none of the females of any of the species she created really cared very much for the male, as such. For the past ten million years Nature has been busily inventing ways to make the male attractive to the female, but the whole business of courtship, from the marine annelids up to man, still lumbers heavily along, like a complicated musical comedy. I have been reading the sad and absorbing story in Volume 6 (Cole to Dama) of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In this volume you can learn about cricket, cotton, costume designing, crocodiles, crown jewels, and Coleridge, but none of this subject is so interesting as the Courtship of animals, which recounts the sorrowful lengths to which all males must go to arouse the interest of a lady.” I don't know why this essay suddenly occurred to me but I confess it is Quite an amusing story to read."

Just if you might be interested.In the spirit of Darwin, Dawkins argues soundly, comprehensively, in this form of a non-fiction book rhetorically above average and merely correct. In contrast to his later work ""The God Delusion,"" which is so full of polemics, he refrains from doing so. He endeavors to provide factual and scientifically sound reasoning. Thus he celebrates the breathtaking emergence of highly sophisticated systems such as the human body with the apparent enthusiasm of an evolutionary biologist, who burns for his profession and also does not hesitate to lead various theses against the theory of evolution in the field. Mind you only around, to feed his lines, then enjoyable to dismantle piece by piece and to intone on their ruins a song of praise to the fantastic, developmental severe history of life. Ironically, the title of the work also refers to a book by the creationist pioneer William Paley, who wanted to use God in the form of a watchmaker to depict the ""production"" of all worldly components. Understandably, Dawkins could not resist alienating this clear image of his natural adversary for his purposes and turning the chronograph maker into an unconscious, a meaningless and blind metaphor for natural selection. As an illustration, object to be drawn through the book, the human eye was chosen. Its origins, shapes, and history of development make the reader pause in astonishment with fascinating insights into out of which amazing creatures our windows to the world have watched world eons of years ago.As long as Dawkins lingers in his field of study, the soundness of his lines of reasoning can hardly be counteracted, and until nowadays, this literature, which was published in 1986, cannot be compared with the writing of equal value. Unfortunately, an inappropriate and meanwhile more than obsolete attempt to show a kind of evolution based on the development of computer technology is to be found among the examples. This is a well-intentioned approach, to make the own theses seem even more comprehensive and to use artificial adaptations in as many subjects as possible to provide evidence. However, as in this case, it inevitably fails because of the dry basis and comprehensibility of the theses, which are too constructed and, funny enough, very much reminiscent of the custom of religious fanatics. These try to bend over and put a concept on everything. Also, the all specific too, rather short inserts on medicine and genetics are correct, but in contrast to the rest of the book exhausting to read. One notices that the actual primary operating field is left shortly. In general, the work would do a small renovation in the direction of the current state of research very well, so that the critical minds of the 21st century to have both well-founded and current reasoning for the hopefully eventually ended, meaningless dispute with ignorant people. Despite the small points of criticism an epochal work that seeks its equal in its timeless correctness and the significant, underlying concerns of the Enlightenment. It testifies to the enthusiasm to which professional occupation with the miracle of the creation of life can become. A fortunate coincidence, too, when this gift falls into the hands of a talented narrative man whose tactical acumen dictates that he should not encourage the prevention of water on the mills of his opponents. By withdrawing any basis of existence on a purely factual basis of any religious embarrassment, creation myth, and Genesis. Now the hard facts only have to flow into the consciousness of the people. Dropwise and very slowly. Sticky droplets.Eine der besten und verständlichsten Argumentationsführungen für Evolutionstheorie und natürliche SelektionGanz im Sinne Darwins argumentiert Dawkins stichhaltig, umfassend, in dieser Form für ein Sachbuch rhetorisch überdurchschnittlich gut und schlichtweg richtig. Er hält sich dabei im Gegensatz zu seinem späteren Werk Gotteswahn, das vor Polemik nur so strotzt, zurück. Er ist bemüht, eine sachliche und wissenschaftlich fundierte Argumentation abzuliefern. So feiert er die die atemberaubende Entstehung höchst diffiziler Systeme wie dem menschlichen Körper mit der spürbaren Begeisterung eines Evolutionsbiologen, der für sein Metier brennt und auch nicht davor zurückschreckt, verschiedenste Thesen gegen die Evolutionstheorie ins Feld zu führen. Wohlgemerkt nur um, sich selbst geschickt den Ball zuspielend, sie anschließend genussvoll Stück für Stück zu demontieren und auf ihren Trümmern ein Loblied auf die erstaunliche, seriöse Entwicklungsgeschichte des Lebens anzustimmen.Ironisch ist auch der Titel des Werks zu verstehen, der sich auf ein Buch des kreationistischen Vordenkers William Paley bezieht, der anhand Gottes in Form eines Uhrmachers die „Fertigung“ sämtlicher weltlicher Bestandteile darstellen wollte. Verständlich, dass Dawkins nicht widerstehen konnte, dieses krasse Bild seines natürlichen Gegners für eigene Zwecke zu entfremden und aus dem Chronographenhersteller eine unbewusst, ohne Sinn und blind arbeitende Metapher für die natürliche Selektion zu machen.Als ein sich durch das Buch ziehendes Veranschaulichungsobjekt wurde das menschliche Auge gewählt. Dessen Ursprung, Formen und Entwicklungsgeschichte lassen mit den faszinierenden Erkenntnissen, aus welch unerwarteten Kreaturen unsere Fenster zur Welt vor Äonen von Jahren geblickt haben, den Leser vor Erstaunen innehalten. Solange Dawkins in seinem Fachbereich verweilt ist der Stichhaltigkeit seiner Argumentationsketten kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen und man kann diesem 1986 erschienen Werk bis heute wenig gleichwertige Literatur zur Seite stellen. Leider ist auch ein unpassender und mittlerweile mehr als nur veralteter Versuch, anhand der Entwicklung der Computertechnik eine Art von Evolution aufzeigen zu wollen, unter den Beispielen. Das ist ein gut gemeinter Ansatz, die eigenen Thesen noch umfassender erscheinen zu lassen und künstliche Adaptionen in möglichst vielen Themenkreisen zur Erbringung von Belegen heranzuziehen. Es scheitert aber, wie in diesem Fall, zwangsläufig an der unzureichenden Basis und Nachvollziehbarkeit der Thesen, die allzu konstruiert sind und lustigerweise sehr an den Usus der religiösen Fanatiker erinnern. Diese versuchen auch auf Biegen und Brechen ein Konzept über alles zu stülpen.Auch sind die allzu fachspezifisch ausgeführten, eher kurzen Einschübe über Medizin und Genetik zwar richtig, aber im Kontrast zum Rest des Buches anstrengend zu lesen. Man merkt, dass das eigentliche Hauptbetätigungsfeld kurzfristig verlassen wird. Generell täte dem Werk eine kleine Renovierung in Richtung des aktuellen Standes der Forschung sehr gut, damit auch die kritischen Geister des 21. Jahrhunderts sowohl wohlfundierte als auch aktuelle Argumentationen für den hoffentlich irgendwann beendeten, sinnbefreiten Disput mit ignoranten Mitmenschen haben.Trotz der kleinen Kritikpunkte eine epochales Werk, dass in seiner zeitlosen Richtigkeit und dem hehren, dahinterstehenden Anliegen der Aufklärung seinesgleichen sucht. Es zeugt von der Begeisterungsfähigkeit, zu der die berufliche Beschäftigung mit dem Wunder der Entstehung des Lebens werden kann. Ein glücklicher Zufall auch, wenn diese Gabe in die Hände eines noch dazu erzählerisch talentierten Mannes fällt, dessen taktischer Scharfsinn ihm gebietet, der Prävention des Wassers auf die Mühlen seiner Gegner keinen Vorschub zu leisten. Indem er auf einer rein sachlichen Basis jeglicher Art von religiöser Verbrämung, Schöpfungsmythos und Entstehungsmären jegliche Existenzgrundlage entzieht. Jetzt müssen die harten Fakten nur noch ins Bewusstsein der Menschen einfließen. Tröpfchenweise und sehr langsam. Klebrige Tröpfchen."
229,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,5,"The Blind Watchmaker is probably one of the best introductory books on evolution.Dawkins takes his time, explaining step by step how Darwinian evolution works.Dawkins explains at great length, how species that look like a ""complex design"" evolve with accumulating small changes via natural selection, why natural selection is ""blind""; ie. it lacks purpose, how random mutations combined with non-random natural selection is necessary for evolution to take place, and why a ""complex design"" does not necessarily mean a ""good design"" (such as ganglion cells which make the electronic wiring interface between the photocells and the brain, face light directly, whereas photocells sit away from the light source in human eye; compared to octopus eye that has photocells facing the light source).Then the structure of genetic blueprint (DNA) is explained; how DNA archives are being copied from cell to cell and from individual to individual, how copy errors are made, and how mutations can occur.In developing his argument that natural selection can explain the complex adaptations of organisms, Dawkins' first concern is to illustrate the difference between the potential for the development of complexity of pure randomness as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the Weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.If you are curious about evolution and choose the best introductory book on the subject this is the one."
230,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I enjoyed this book very much, despite the difficulty of reading the very small typeface. Dawkins' style is almost folksy, and not at all the arrogant, condescending style that some reviewers mention. The first chapter, about echolocation in bats, is fascinating. I also enjoyed reading about the different philosophies involved in taxonomy, the classification of species. Some reviewers mention that Dawkins' explanations are ""old hat"", and that the computer simulations are primitive; but they do need to keep in mind that the book is already 25 years old! While I do appreciate the arguments Dawkins puts forward against saltationists and punctuationalists, I found them to be repetitive and boring after a while."
231,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/490192-charles,2,"Enchantingly beautiful fiction, 23 Mar 2007  Musings of a fideist (a materialistic fideist). Richard Dawkins has a breathtaking gift for expressive, catchy writing. His handling of illustration and narrative flow like silk. Yet he reminds me of an eloquent 19th century clergyman. His persistent dedication to the high altar of gradualistic explanation, however incredibly improbable, stretches credulity to breaking point. Take for example his extraordinary leap on p.134, para 1, where self-replicating RNA will almost magically come into being - 'all so utterly simple and automatic'. There it is by fiat - Dawkins wishes and so it must be! Abracadabra! Those who have worked in the field know how fasitidious and temperamental RNA and enzymes can be even in the best conditions - yet here it is in rock pool. There are some problems even billions of years won't solve - ask the mathematicians. Or take his extraordinary and uncharacteristically rambling tautology about the peacock's tail, pp 203-206, which boils down to an unexplained discrepancy in tail length (p204) and majority female taste (p205)! This is no cogent defence of evolution of an extraordinarily complex structure, just a mystical will-of-the-wisp-like weaving of concepts to meet his desired end. He reiterates Darwin's acid test of his own theory, on p 91, but if really believed what he wrote there, he would have abandoned neo-Darwinism years ago - I have long since published one very clear example of what he seeks, and his written answer to me was that he couldn't answer it, and there are myriad more. Dawkins is a magician with words, though not as self critical and cautious as he ought to be with scientific argument. "
232,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"I have only ever read one other Dawkins book before, The God Delusion, and really didn't like the style or attitude of the writing, so was not completely looking forward to this one.The primary aim of the book is to look at all the evidence and theories that make up the Darwinian theory of evolution and natural selection. He considers all the evidence from real life examples, in particular the eye, and buy using a computer program that he wrote, demonstrates how new variants of a species can evolve with very simple initial amendments. Later on in the book he looks at how DNA works, the effects of positive feedback on evolution and the way that mutations works of evolution and selection. He also considers the complexity of trying to document the tree of life.Overall I thought this book was a better read than the previous one I had read. Bearing in mind it was written originally in 1986 most of it is still valid, though we now understand far more than we did then. He can get on his high horse quite often, but thankfully not so much in this book."

More people would be convinced watching an episode of Sagan's Cosmos than slugging through this book. I still remember how Cosmos changed the teenage me. Just remember the high-and-mighty all-smiles Sagan! This preacher, one Ricky Dawkins, with his pompous writing, repeating the same phrases, picking fight with other preachers of the same flock (like Reverend Steven J Gould) and offering the worldview that no other beliefs have a sensible place en este mundo may actually repulse a lot of would-be converts.But what I cannot deny is, I am a sucker for this preacher.

I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:“A physicist certainly doesn’t need Darwinism in order to do physics. He might think that biology is a trivial subject compared with physics. It would follow from this that, in his opinion, Darwinism is of trivial importance to science. But he could not sensibly conclude from this that it is therefore false!”Understanding how Darwinian evolution works can change your attitude toward life and self, substantially. What we learned about Darwin at high school is inadequate. This book provides you with simplified biochemistry, biology, math, physics, and reasoning so that you can easily conceive why Darwinism is the most reasonable answer to world's complexity.I would like to quote another part:“In Darwin’s view, the whole point of the theory of evolution by natural selection was that it provided a non-miraculous account of the existence of complex adaptations. For what it is worth, it is also the whole point of this book. For Darwin, any evolution that had to be helped over the jumps by God was not evolution at all. It made a nonsense of the central point of evolution. In the light of this, it is easy to see why Darwin constantly reiterated the gradualness of evolution.”This way of thinking is not just confined to the past. Evolutionary-based science is taking over a lot of fields. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University is a leading one. You can find out more at: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/ "

His arguments follow a defined path but still manage to meander through welcome asides. He uses metaphors and thought experiments well, most of the book was very easy to follow.And what arguments he makes! The probability of miracles, potential precursors of RNA, the importance of gradual change. His goal is to show that it's possible to explain the rise of complexity from a simple world and he spectacularly succeeds.However, I'm likely not the intended audience of this book. He spent more time arguing against alternative theories than I would have liked. I had no idea what Mutationism was before he explained it but it sounded dumb within the first few sentences; he didn't need to spend as many pages dismissing it as he did. Same with the entire chapter on Punctuationism. The first few pages went over some really cool notes on speciation and how some large mutations fit into darwinism that the book wouldn't have been complete without. The rest of the chapter tried to defend darwinism from a media I had never paid attention to in the first place.The last third of the book is worth reading because it contains a few insights.

When they say: 'nature designed a creature like this and that.', 'it gave them wings' etc. I was thinking: 'What nonsense is this? It's not possible, nature isn't smart to design a complex creature'. But, I was all wrong.Nature doesn't have to be smart to design something. Living beings don't emerge by luck or chance but from necessity. Small and gradual steps make those creatures climb mount improbable, and they happen to look like highly designed creatures.True knowledge not always resides within your gut instincts and common sense. For example, the book explains that if there's a grand designer, it must have been designed too. Therefore, as the book shows, there is no design, only emergence. Only you need to have an open mind to see the truth. Think logically, you will find the truth."

240,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."

The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages.

In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

249,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "
250,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13307338-robert-day,4,"I've got reviewers block.To overcome this, I'm going to write a page of absolute garbage that may only be tangentially related to this book. In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
251,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
252,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
253,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
254,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
256,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
257,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
258,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
259,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."

I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

I bought this book not long after it was published, and for some reason it was relegated to an obscure bookshelf until recently. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written. In fact, if anything, subsequent research has confirmed many of the speculations made in the book. Highly recommended."

266,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book has been on my TBR pile for a while, but I finally picked it up as my bedside book and quickly got hooked. Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."
267,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84134671-fabio-brady,4,"Dawkins delves into the details to give the reader a more modern understanding and well-rounded overview of Evolution by Natural Selection.The author asserts that the designer of life is a mindless automatic process, the Blind Watchmaker (evolution), that guides species to adaptive complexity. Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."

The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid.

Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "
270,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."
272,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610244-arjen,5,"This is the third book by Richard Dawkins I read and another winner. The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""

275,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

Dawkins expertly makes the case for evolution though the people who refuse to accept it are, generally speaking, not the type to be swayed by evidence and logic and not the audience for this book."
277,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

279,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "

The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
281,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
282,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
283,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
284,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
286,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
287,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
288,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
289,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun.

If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written.

Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."

Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."

The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid.

Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "
300,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption.

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."
302,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610244-arjen,5,"This is the third book by Richard Dawkins I read and another winner. The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""
303,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1179465-ericthehamster,0,"""I don't agree with Dawkins much of the time (I find his atheism as fanatical as the religions he criticises), but find him an intelligent and entertaining read. He posits the other side of the coin to the argument for """"intelligent design"""".

305,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."
306,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,2,"2.5 stars - Solid enough science, of course, even if it's 20+ years out of date (I'm commenting on the 1996 edition) but it's overlong and downright tedious at times.Which is no excuse not to read it. Dawkins expertly makes the case for evolution though the people who refuse to accept it are, generally speaking, not the type to be swayed by evidence and logic and not the audience for this book."
307,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

309,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "
310,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13307338-robert-day,4,"I've got reviewers block.To overcome this, I'm going to write a page of absolute garbage that may only be tangentially related to this book. In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
311,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
312,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
313,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
314,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
316,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
317,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
318,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
319,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."

I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

I bought this book not long after it was published, and for some reason it was relegated to an obscure bookshelf until recently. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written. In fact, if anything, subsequent research has confirmed many of the speculations made in the book. Highly recommended."

326,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book has been on my TBR pile for a while, but I finally picked it up as my bedside book and quickly got hooked. Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."
327,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84134671-fabio-brady,4,"Dawkins delves into the details to give the reader a more modern understanding and well-rounded overview of Evolution by Natural Selection.The author asserts that the designer of life is a mindless automatic process, the Blind Watchmaker (evolution), that guides species to adaptive complexity. Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."

The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid.

Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "
330,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."

The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""

335,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

Dawkins expertly makes the case for evolution though the people who refuse to accept it are, generally speaking, not the type to be swayed by evidence and logic and not the audience for this book."
337,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

339,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "
340,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13307338-robert-day,4,"I've got reviewers block.To overcome this, I'm going to write a page of absolute garbage that may only be tangentially related to this book. In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
341,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
342,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
343,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
344,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
346,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
347,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
348,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
349,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."

I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written. In fact, if anything, subsequent research has confirmed many of the speculations made in the book. Highly recommended."

Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."
357,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84134671-fabio-brady,4,"Dawkins delves into the details to give the reader a more modern understanding and well-rounded overview of Evolution by Natural Selection.The author asserts that the designer of life is a mindless automatic process, the Blind Watchmaker (evolution), that guides species to adaptive complexity. Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."
358,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533479-andre,3,"Good:* Answered the question about how is it possible that a complicated being like human could exist due to evolution and without requiring any kind of divine intervention. The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid. This makes the book longer and slower than it needs to be."

Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "
360,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."
362,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610244-arjen,5,"This is the third book by Richard Dawkins I read and another winner. The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""

365,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

Dawkins expertly makes the case for evolution though the people who refuse to accept it are, generally speaking, not the type to be swayed by evidence and logic and not the audience for this book."
367,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

369,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "

In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
371,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
372,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
373,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
374,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
376,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
377,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
378,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
379,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."

I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written.

Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."

Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."

The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid.

Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "
390,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."

Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""

395,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

Dawkins expertly makes the case for evolution though the people who refuse to accept it are, generally speaking, not the type to be swayed by evidence and logic and not the audience for this book."
397,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

399,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "

In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
401,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
402,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
403,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
404,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
406,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
407,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."

The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
409,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."

I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

I bought this book not long after it was published, and for some reason it was relegated to an obscure bookshelf until recently. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written. In fact, if anything, subsequent research has confirmed many of the speculations made in the book. Highly recommended."

Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."
417,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84134671-fabio-brady,4,"Dawkins delves into the details to give the reader a more modern understanding and well-rounded overview of Evolution by Natural Selection.The author asserts that the designer of life is a mindless automatic process, the Blind Watchmaker (evolution), that guides species to adaptive complexity. Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."

The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid.

Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "
420,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."

The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""

425,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

427,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

429,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "
430,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13307338-robert-day,4,"I've got reviewers block.To overcome this, I'm going to write a page of absolute garbage that may only be tangentially related to this book. In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
431,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
432,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
433,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
434,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
436,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
437,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
438,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
439,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."

I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written. In fact, if anything, subsequent research has confirmed many of the speculations made in the book. Highly recommended."

Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."

Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."

The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid.

Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "

The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."
452,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610244-arjen,5,"This is the third book by Richard Dawkins I read and another winner. The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""
453,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1179465-ericthehamster,0,"""I don't agree with Dawkins much of the time (I find his atheism as fanatical as the religions he criticises), but find him an intelligent and entertaining read. He posits the other side of the coin to the argument for """"intelligent design"""".

455,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

Dawkins expertly makes the case for evolution though the people who refuse to accept it are, generally speaking, not the type to be swayed by evidence and logic and not the audience for this book."
457,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "

In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
461,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
462,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
463,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
464,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
466,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
467,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
468,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
469,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."

I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written. In fact, if anything, subsequent research has confirmed many of the speculations made in the book. Highly recommended."

Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."

Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."

The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid.

Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "

Next on my list is ""The extended phenotype"" and I hope that, by reading more and more books about this topic (and preferably written by Dawkins), I will conclude that the new books are only a little bit less challenging than the previous book of Richard Dawkins.

""The Blind Watchmaker"" was first published in the UK in 1986. It explains the theory of evolution in detail from a theoretical perspective. The term ""clock and watch"" in the title of this book is a metaphor for living things, emphasizing that the structure and function of living things are complicated and ingenious. The ""Watchmaker"" in the title is borrowed from the famous monograph ""Natural Theology"" by William Paley, the 18th century theologian. Richard Dawkins was born in Nairobi, Kenya in 1941. He received a Bachelor of Zoology, Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science from Oxford University. He is one of the most famous and outspoken atheists and evolutionists still alive today. He has the title masterpieces of ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" (Darwin's Rottweiler): ""The Selfish Gene"", ""Blind Watchmaker"" "", ""Evidence of Evolution"", ""Ancestor's Story"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Impossible2. Good design3. Progressive change4. Animal Space5. Gene file6. What a heaven7. Creative evolution8. Sex selection9. Disease? Gradient?10. Tree of Life Philosophers are thinking about 3 questions: Who am I? Where am i from Where am i going? In fact, biologists are studying these three issues. Even today, biologists cannot tell us clearly how every part of the human body works? How did humans and other creatures be born and become what they are today? Where is the end of biological evolution? I have read a series of books called ""Earth Chronicles"". This series of books has been published since 1976. The author Xiqin's explanation of the origin of mankind is the result of intelligent biological intervention. But until today, in fact, for a long period of time in the future, I have no way to firmly believe in any view of this ""natural evolution"" or ""creation theory"" . I sometimes think like this: If human beings were created by other intelligent creatures, where did those intelligent creatures come from? Even if they were created, this cycle should have an end, and the creator at the end should be more intelligent than human beings. If the creator at the end was born in heaven and earth (is it equivalent to evolution?), then since more intelligent creatures can evolve naturally, it is entirely possible for humans to evolve naturally. Specifically, whether you believe that human beings were created by God, female snails, extraterrestrial intelligent creatures, or any intelligent life, then the question that follows is, who created these creators? It is undoubtedly hard to convince people to make a conclusion that ""the creator naturally arises from the universe, or the creator is the starting point of the universe"" assertively. Because creators are more advanced than human beings, the possibility of them naturally occurring should be smaller. Even today, physics tells us that the universe originated in the Big Bang, so we will also have this question, what was before the Big Bang? What caused the Big Bang? The term ""watchmaker"" comes from the 18th century theologian Perry's ""Natural Theology"". Perry said that if you find a stone in a deserted area, you can easily accept the idea of ""it's always here""; but when you find a watch in a deserted area, You almost never think ""it's always here"". So, since the watch can not occur spontaneously in nature, that it far more complex human and other biological clocks, not to appear spontaneously in nature. Therefore, there must be a role such as a ""watchmaker"", who created humans and other lives. Dawkins believes that this ""watchmaker"" is the physical law of nature itself, and this law governs the completion of evolution. The laws of physics have no purpose, so they are ""blind"" or ""blind."" Each of us has a tendency to experience miracles when faced with highly complex machines. Try to recall the first time you heard that AlphaGo defeated the strongest Go player in humans, or the Atlas humanoid robot learned the feeling of backflip. This makes us instinctively unacceptable to the concept of evolution. It is difficult for us to imagine how the laws of physics without autonomous consciousness can lead to orderly results. However, Darwinists tell us that the process of evolution took billions of years to complete, and each of us cannot really understand what such a long time means, and this has created another great difficulty for our understanding. It is precisely because of the huge differences in time measurement scales that many hypotheses in modern biology and geography were ridiculed by almost everyone when they were first proposed. If we look at the concept of evolution in a broader sense, can the 300-year period since humans entered an industrial society count as evolution? Although our genes have hardly changed, the changes in human society from organizational structure to production capacity may be far more than 30,000 years. If such a cliff-like evolution can be completed in 300 years, what does 300 million years mean for the evolution of organisms? From inorganic matter to the creation of intelligent creatures that can send spacecraft into outer space, is 300 million years enough? Those of us who have received nine years of compulsory education know that genes are the basis of the inheritance of every organism. In the genetic process of genes, non-directional mutations may occur randomly, but natural selection has a direction. Evolution seems to be accomplished through such infinitely many cumulative choices. The long period of time makes the gradual accumulation of choices almost infinitely many times, each time the change is so small that you can almost think that the difference is infinitely small. Here we need to have a certain understanding of the concept of limit, which once again caused a barrier to understanding. The author is not only a biologist, but also has some experience in programming. He described in detail the results shown by an evolutionary program he wrote. The results show that as long as you determine some basic rules, set the possibility of random mutations in the system, and finally add a certain tendency selection (such as artificial selection), the final result may seem to have a certain law, it seems to be It was designed artificially. Because evolution is gradually completed, a natural doubt will follow. Why are these intermediate steps or intermediate states of organisms not eliminated? Many organs or tissues are obviously interdependent. In other words, if they appear alone, they are basically useless ; if they appear at the same time , they can play a huge role. Human organs are so sophisticated, like a huge machine, it will stop working immediately if any link is missing. Before other links that need to be used as assistance have not yet evolved, this incomplete machine is not only unable to perform its functions, but also a huge burden. Why is it not discarded, but retained, as if purposefully waiting for the last one Is the evolution of parts completed? Understanding the three questions at the beginning, whether understood in a philosophical or biological sense, may actually be meaningless for the survival of a single organism. However, the expression of certain DNA in human genes seems to determine that some people will be full of enthusiasm and curiosity about these issues. This curiosity about the unknown engraved in genes, no matter how time passes, will always continue in the human population with the help of certain individuals. "" Once I was invited to a university debate association to debate with creationists. I still remember the shock I felt. After the debate, we had dinner together. My next seat was a young lady who was in the debate. Representing a creationist, the speech is fairly powerful. I don’t think she will be a creationist, so I asked her to answer me honestly why she would speak on behalf of the creationist. She admitted that she was just honing her debate skills. I find it more challenging to defend my unconvinced position. It seems that the University Debate Association does this. The person participating in the debate is designated to defend which side, regardless of their beliefs. Their beliefs have no place in the debate. I'm not good at speaking to the public. I came all the way to attend because I believe the topic I was invited to defend is true. I found that the people of the Debating Association only used the topic of the debate as an introduction to the debate game, so I decided not to accept the invitation of the Debating Association. Issues involving scientific truth should not allow false arguments. "" Before I entered university in high school, I was very interested in the sense of debate. And he did join the debate team in his freshman year. Later, I immediately found out that I needed to defend my objection. Although intellectually I can understand that this is done to make myself more critical thinking. But emotionally it was difficult to accept, so I only participated in one or two debates, then withdrew from the debate team, and never joined the debate association ever since. "" What I want to argue is that no matter where the complex things in the universe appear, the explanation may be roughly the same; it applies to us, chimpanzees, worms, oak trees, and monsters in outer space. On the other hand, for what I call "" ""Simple"" things, such as rocks, clouds, rivers, galaxies and quarks. These are all things in physics. Chimpanzees, dogs, bats, cockroaches, people, insects, dandelions, bacteria and aliens, It's a thing of biology. The difference lies in the complexity of the design. Biology studies complex things, and those things feel like they were designed for a certain purpose. Physics studies simple things, and they don't make us feel ""designed"" at all. At first glance, artificial objects such as computers and cars seem to be exceptions. They are very complex and obviously designed, but they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic, not flesh and blood. But in this book, I will firmly regard them as biological research objects. "" "" If we find such a clock in the wild, even if we don't know how it appeared, its precise and complex design will force us to conclude: this clock must have a manufacturer; it must be in some time and place. There is a craftsman or a group of craftsmen who, for a certain purpose-we find that the purpose is indeed achieved-made it; the maker knows how to make a clock and designs its use. Perry insists that no one can reasonably refute this conclusion. Even atheists will come to this conclusion when thinking about natural works, because: every sign of ingenuity, every design expression, not only exists in clocks, works of nature There are both; the difference between the two is that natural works show greater ingenuity, more complex designs, beyond the degree of artificial products, it is difficult to count. "" "" The simulation of the telescope and the eye, the simulation of the clock and the living thing, is wrong. The opposite of the appearance is correct. The only watchmaker in nature is the blind force of physics, but those forces condense and operate in a very special way. And the truth The watchmaker had a foresight: in his mind, he had a future purpose. He designed gears and clockwork and planned the connection between them. Darwin discovered a blind, unconscious, and automatic process, all biological Existence and seemingly purposeful constructions, we now know that can be explained by this process, this is natural selection. Natural Selection has no purpose in its heart. Natural Selection has no intention or mind. Natural Selection does not plan for the future. Natural Selection has no vision. There is no foresight, not even vision. If Natural Selection is a watchmaker in nature, it must be a blind watchmaker. "" This evolutionary force is a bit similar to the way computers produce artificial intelligence today .

488,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7856222-alexandru,5,A good insight on the theory of evolution. It is a pity that I did not have access to this book when I was in school. I might of chose a different path for my life.
489,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17108975-odi-shonga,4,"Contrary to the implication of the subtitle, this book isn't just an attack on creationism. In fact, it's a sweeping defence of Darwinian natural selection against various opponents, with creationism probably taken the least seriously (but addressed all the same).Once more, Dawkins manages to treat you as a sophistacted reader, while somehow never falling prey to the curse of knowledge (where experts are bad at explaining because they fail to gauge the right level of background knowledge or interest their reader has). Dawkins proves himself to be a supreme writer once again, never failing to convey the difficult in a graspable and uncondescending way.The crux of the book is that evolution by natural selection is the only way to explain the organised complexity of life. This is because the chance of organised, living complexity arising in one leap is propesterously unlikely, so it would have to be gradual. Then, of the gradual ways complex life could arise, all rival theories fall flat. Some theories that are dispensed with include: the blue-print theory of trait inheritence, where traits that are well-used get passed down, as though saved onto a genetic blue-print; the mutation-first theory of evolution, where random mutations guide evolutionary improvement, not natural pressures or a combination of both; and others that, if I had a better memory, I'd be able to list here for you, but I don't, so you get a shitty half-baked summary instead -- sorry. Anyway, if you don't really buy mythology, but you want a creation story that's backed by reason and evidence, you want to read this and The Selfish Gene. It does occur to me that Dawkins is basically an evangelist for Darwinism, and I am basically a convert. But hey, we all have to believe in something, don't we? Rather this sprawling web of intricate connections and relatedness -- a world of variegated beings united -- than an odd mythology that encourages obedience, fear, and chauvinism, and that probably isn't true."

I haven't studied Biology for over 30 years and I gave up because they kept trying to make me draw an eye. I was terrible at drawing eyes. So I got as much of this as my brain was able to process and there was a ton of goodness, but I could have done with more anecdotes and slightly less God-bashing. I get that God-bashing is Dawkins' superpower, but his arguments for natural selection stand on their own without them having to be a refutation."

""After all, you've been thinking about reading the book for the last 10 years, Avishek. Why not now? Just get it over with and then do what-fucking-ever you wanted to do,"" I told myself. And then I realized my mistake.It's not reading the book that the mistake was, it's in fact not reading the book for such a long time. Why should I, though? It's a very old book, written 30 years ago which is bound to have backdated facts and incomplete pieces of information whereas I've already read Why Evolution Is True (2009) by Jerry A. Coyne, Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (2008) by my Facebook friend Neil Shubin, Nick Lane's Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution (2009), and Dawkins' recent work The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution (2009). And above all, there's The Selfish Gene, which is like the bible to me, containing (almost) all the answers I need regarding life and other shitty little things. But little did I know that I had so much yet to know. (facepalm)The title of the book could reasonably have been ""The Blind Watchmaker And How She Does Her Job"". Before depicting the image of this watchmaker, an allusion to William Paley's infamous ""Watchmaker"" argument for the so-called ""complex design"" of the living things, Dawkins first went on to define the idea of ""complexity"" and ""design"", since the main thesis of the book is to demonstrate how natural selection alone can give rise to the apparent design of complex life forms. Then he got straight onto explaining what natural selection is and how it works with his mind-boggling ability to use simple and easy to conceive analogies with numerous examples (Paley's favorite one - the human eye - being the first) and his own simplistic computer simulation of evolution. In his signature style, like a great teacher as he always is, Dawkins painstakingly brought up example after example of animal adaptations and explained each and every one of them from an evolutionary perspective in such a way that is guaranteed to plant the idea of natural selection deep inside your brain that you can never get rid of. And once you understand it fully, there's no denying the inevitability of the ""miraculously"" complex design that we see around us today.The first 8 chapters contain the essence of the book. The last three chapters are merely an extension where Dawkins brought up a few alternative hypotheses to Darwinism and decisively destroyed them in style. To me, this is where the book became kind of monotonous and boring. Nevertheless, I guess it was necessary to make it complete.Of all the books on evolution I read, this one ponders into the idea of evolution in the most elaborate manner which will introduce the reader to the Darwinian way of thinking and leave him/her conceptually enlightened. It's a must-read for every science enthusiast out there, especially if you're new to the idea of evolution and looking for good materials to start learning, this should be the first pop-science book to read."

I feel as if I need to explain my own view about religion before I can properly review this book, but honestly, I don't care much for discussing religion on the internet, in a book review. So, to make it short, I'm an atheist. In fact, (and to quote Douglas Adams, because it's always good to quote Douglas Adams), I'm a radical atheist.Which makes reading this book kinda like preaching to the choir.That's probably the reason why I didn't really enjoy it. That, and the pseudo-scientific approach. The author is so eagerly trying to convince me of his views on evolution, he goes into great detail explaining evolution to me (unfortunately, he assumes that I know nothing about evolution, thus explaining it in tiny little baby steps that leave out the interesting ""real"" science). He says, look, evolution, it works! It's right! This is what happened! BELIEVE ME!And yes, sure, I believe him. No wait, I don't believe him. I know for a fact that what he says, well, not particularly what he says, but I know for a fact that evolution is true.See, where I'm from, nobody doubts that evolution isn't true. nobody would even suggest that ""creation"" is a real, scientific alternative to evolution. In 31 years and with a post-grad degree, I have never met anyone who would have doubted evolution.So the whole purpose of this book is completely baffling to me.It's not enough of a science book to really teach about evolution. And it's not combative enough to actually come right out and say ""there is no creation."" The only thing the author does is show that evolution works - the important step, the step that says ""and not only does it work, but here, let me show you why there is no god involved in it either"", he leaves out.I know I'm so disappointed with this book because that last thing was what I expected. I expected someone to write about why creation doesn't work, not why evolution does. That's not the authors fault.I might give another one of his books a try, but it'll probably have the same effect - we already have the same opinion (or close enough, I guess), for me to find his books interesting, provocative or even thought-provoking. I feel as if the book only deserves two stars (""it was okay""), but I'll add another one for the effort.they may have an entirely different effect on you, though, so I still recommend you read one.

493,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"A great read that explains evolution, natural selection, darwinism, and why these are not only the theories most strongly supported by the evidence, but also why they are the only theories we have that, in principle, could even begin to explain the existence of life. Dawkins takes a complicated subject—in fact, many subjects, including biology, chemistry, physics, math, probability, programming, geology, and more—and manages to explain them in a clear, approachable way that can be understood by just about any educated person.There are lots of wonderful insights and explanations in the book:* The physical ""shape"" of an object is enough to create order from disorder. For example, consider a natural sieve—that is, any item that just happens to have a small hole in it. Small objects will tend to go through the hole and large objects will not. The result is that items get sorted by size. We get order from disorder, but no designer was involved! Similarly, the ""shape"" of biological devices can create order, and the key idea behind life is that certain molecules can create copies of themselves solely because if their ""shape"" and normal physical/chemical processes. It seems highly orderly, but no designer is necessary to make this order possible.* The book goes through a few possible theories for how life could've started on earth—how these initial self-replicating ""shapes"" could've formed. One interesting idea was that life developed from clay crystals (silicates). These crystals live in river beds and take various shapes based on the flow of the water and the other crystals they touch. Occasionally, the crystals just happen to form a shape that tends to stick together very well and as more clay runs into this shape, it clumps up more and more, and eventually forms a small dam in the river. This causes stagnant pools of water to form near these dams and, during the dry season, these pools dry up. The clay also dries, cracks, and then wind blows this crystalline structure around, like spores. Some of these crystals end up in other rivers, where their shape cause clumping to happen again, creating more of the same ""shapes"", and repeating the entire process with dams, pools, and drying. In other words, the shape of these clay crystals allows them to ""replicate"" themselves. * Of course, clay crystals are inorganic, but perhaps the organic molecules that are the building blocks of modern life were able to somehow build on top of the replication abilities of these inorganic crystals. For example, some organic material that happened to be in the river may have bonded with the clay, changed its shape in some way that happened to increase the odds of the clay replicating, and now not only are clay crystals being replicated from river to river, but the organic molecules also come along for the ride. Eventually, the organic molecules may be all that's necessary. * But how could the order and complexity of modern life arise from such ""random"" events? What are the odds that clay silicates blowing in the wind leads to something as intricate as the human eye? The book has a great discussion on the probability of life, with two key points: the odds of something as complicated as an eye forming are so vanishingly small as to effectively be impossible; but the odds of the basic building blocks of life forming, given that those building blocks are much, much simpler than the eye, are much higher. Those odds may still be low, but not impossibly low, and given that there are billions of planets and billions of years, even fairly unlikely events can happen.* A key second argument around the idea of ""random"" events leading to complex, orderly organisms is that while the events (i.e., mutations) are random, the selection process is not! In particularly, it's not that complexity appeared randomly, in one giant leap, going from a simple replicator to a fully-formed eye, but rather, that what we're seeing is adaptive complexity, where complexity increases step by step, generation after generation. Each change is a tiny increment that happens randomly, and if it happens to increase the chances of replication, it will be passed down to future generations. * Dawkins gives lots of examples to highlight the difference between single-step theories vs multi-step theories. One example is based on the infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters theorem. In fact, Dawkins suggests a simpler version: how long would a single monkey typing randomly at a single typewriter take to come up with just one specific sentence from Shakespeare? If each sentence was written separately and with no relation to previous sentences (""single-step""), the odds are extraordinarily low—even with a very fast monkey (that is, a computer program simulating a monkey), it would take longer than the age of the universe. But now imagine instead the monkey starts with one sentence, and at each step makes a bunch of variations on the sentence, each with random mutations to it. Then, some ""selection pressure"" (e.g., a computer) selects the sentence that, in some way, resembles the chosen Shakespeare sentence the most, and the process repeats. With this ""multi-step"" process, the odds of ending up with the desired sentence are actually quite good, and our computer program can get it done in a matter of minutes. * We can see real-world examples of this idea. Dawkins walks through the step-by-step process that evolved the eye, from a tiny spot that just happens to be sensitive to light, to that spot becoming a small indentation, all the way up to the full eye. There are entire books that walk through every stage of this evolution and show real, living creatures that have eyes at all of these stages. It turns out that ""half an eye"" really is better than ""no eye,"" in the sense that even a little bit of vision is better than none at all! * One remarkable insight pops up towards the end of the book: the only reason we are OK with ""speciesism""—that is, treating some species over others, such as believing in ""human rights,"" but not the rights of other animals—is that the vast majority of ""intermediate"" species in evolution just happen to have died off. If all of them were still around, and we could see all the tiny increments from us to our primate ancestors and other mammals, we'd realize that there is no clear point where ""human"" begins and ""primate"" ends. If we could see all the species in between, we'd realize that the definition of which animals are ""human""—and which ones deserve special rights—is not at all clear cut. I suspect the same will happen if we ever develop general AI. There may be countless small increments from simple, unthinking, mechanical computer algorithms to self-aware, sentient AI, and there probably won't be a single, clear point where we can declare the AI as ""alive"" and start pondering what rights it has.After the initial discussion of how evolution works, the last few chapters seem to be Dawkins responding to various critics, alternate theories, taking a tangent to discuss taxonomy, and so on. These parts feel like we're being pulled into Dawkins' personal arguments and pet peeves, so they are a bit less interesting. But overall, it's a wonderful book, and well worth reading to understand how life came to be."
494,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4972722-terry-grigg,2,"Dawkins’comes up with some good ideas, concepts and examples of explaining evolution, like the development of the eye and bat sonar, and to his credit mentions speciesism and the arms race in nature. I like this line ‘Evolution continually became stuck up sterile blind alleys. Degeneration seemed to be the commonest outcome of even the most carefully guided evolution.’ Idiocracy for sure. He goes on about the sieve principle of selection, how things are arranged in nature as they are, the product of physical forces and reactions. And evolution having no long-term goal, and never starting from a clean drawing board. On the life cycle of the cicada and the way it combats predators. The thylacine ... ‘Maybe they were pests to humans, but humans were much bigger pests to them; now there are no thylacines left and a considerable surplus of humans.’However, Dawkins is not a very good story teller and presents science in a very verbose and convoluted manner. e.g. the way he goes on about the tail length of birds as a means of sexual selection. And considering it an honour to be fossilised. Does he want immortality? He comes up with irritating made up words like ‘existenceworthiness’, and a chapter entitled ‘Puncturing Punctuationism’, and Saltationist and transformed cladists. I think he enjoys being pedantic, and like evolution, his narrative ends up in a cul-de-sac. There is the basic contradiction of ‘intelligent design’ and the ‘blind watchmaker’. He concludes that the Blind Watchmaker programme was endowed with richness, versatility, luxuriance and beauty. It all boils down to whether you think the ‘blind watchmaker’ has done a good job, or should have that damn watch rammed up where the sun don’t shine. This is like comparing his ‘lucky ones’ quote from ‘Unweaving the Rainbow’, and the universe having ‘no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference’ from ‘River Out of Eden’. I prefer the latter. But he should really stick to the day job."
495,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61602483-dietrich,3,"In his preface to The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins says that “We are entirely accustomed to the idea that complex elegance is an indicator of premeditated, crafted design. This is probably the most powerful reason for the belief, held by the vast majority of people that have ever lived, in some kind of supernatural deity. It took a very large leap of the imagination for Darwin and Wallace to see that, contrary to all intuition, there is another way and, once you have understood it, a far more plausible way, for complex ‘design’ to arise of out primeval simplicity. A leap of the imagination so large that, to this day, many people seem still unwilling to make it. It is the main purpose of this book to help the reader to make this leap.” (p. xvi) This quote suggests that Dawkins has a cultural agenda entangled with a scientific one, and TBW follows through on this suggestion. Historically, of course, darwinism dealt a knock-out blow to Paley’s version of natural theology by providing an explanation for adaptive complexity without recourse to a Creator, who now appeared superfluous to the task at hand. Much of Dawkins’s text is devoted to arguing how slow, gradual, cumulative natural selection can explain “prodigies of apparent miracle.” Interestingly enough, Dawkins acknowledges that developments in the second half of the 20th century (findings in molecular biology and the resulting increased difficulty of providing a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life in light of these findings) have led some thinkers to argue that perhaps Paley’s Creator/Watchmaker was no longer superfluous. Dawkins counters that relying on a Creator to explain the origin of life will not do, since it simply assumes the preexistence of complexity, the origins of which need to be explained. Nor can one take the “lazy way out” here by positing the eternity of God. Dawkins retorts that one “might as well just say ‘DNA was always there’, or ‘Life was always there’, and be done with it.” (p.141) In other words, Dawkins does not merely say that darwinism is a better, because less superfluous, explanation than intelligent design for explaining biological complexity, but that intelligent design is intrinsically a non-explanation. This notion that ID is an explanatory non-starter is unobjectionable to all who share the scientific commitment to methodological naturalism. However, Dawkins makes arguments that go beyond the framework of methodological naturalism to promote an aggressive philosophical naturalism, though he does not distinguish the two. For instance, he provides an argument of sorts against the existence of God at the end of the book, one rooted in his scientific quest to understand the development of complexity: “It would be untamed chance if once there was no eye, and then, suddenly, in the twinkling of a generation, an eye appeared, fully fashioned, perfect and whole. This is possible, but the odds against it will keep us busy writing noughts till the end of time. The same applies to the odds against the spontaneous existence of any fully fashioned, perfect and whole beings, including-I see no way of avoiding the conclusion-deities.” (p.317) Of course, this argument is rather strange, since it does not take into account the possibility of an eternal God. Based on the aforementioned p. 141 quote, and despite his willingness to tackle the question of the existence of God, apparently Dawkins thinks the notion that God is eternal is only worth mentioning when it is part of a scientifically illegitimate approach the topic of biological complexity.Methodological naturalism not only legitimates but also delimits science’s proper sphere of authority, giving space for other forms of intellectual inquiry. Dawkins’s general intellectual approach can be seen as a form of scientism, which jettisons the notion that science has any limits. When the famous atheist Antony Flew changed his mind and became a deist based in large part upon the origin of life issue as it it appears in the aftermath of Watson & Crick, he made a point of framing his argument as philosophic rather than scientific in nature. Similarly, Francis Collins, a leading theistic evolutionist, is quite clear that this intellectual worldview does not constitute a scientific theory. Collins, who strongly opposes the notion that ID should be considered science, wrote a highly positive review of Flew’s book Why There Is A God. Although Collins’s outlook on the origin of life differs from Flew’s, and though the two men have very different conceptions of the Deity, they share a commitment to methodological naturalism in science and the pursuit of truth beyond science. Both former atheists profoundly altered their entire worldview based on this pursuit. Dawkins’s especially aggressive scientism leaves no room for such intellectual quests, nor for the answers that Collins and Flew found on their journeys. In TBW, Dawkins views theistic evolution (which he calls guided evolution) as illegitimate. His case against the theistic evolutionists is that they smuggle God into their account of evolution at some point. And Collins’s explicit distancing of theistic evolution from scientific theory matters not one bit to Dawkins or his followers. In Dawkins’s scientistic account, darwinian evolution and theism are irreconcilable, and Darwin wins the contest. And though I have not read The God Delusion, it seems obvious that in this later book the hostility to religion intensifies, as Dawkins utilizes an evolutionary approach to understanding religion that treats/disparages it as a parasitic meme. As for Antony Flew, Dawkins’s response to his turn to deism was to speak of his senility and possible exploitation by others. I find Dawkins’s aggressive scientism un-compelling, off-putting, and even a bit alarming. Though attacks on evolutionary theory are often dismissed as the reaction of hayseeds who are not yet reconciled to science, Francis Collins makes a fruitful suggestion to the effect that the Intelligent Design “movement” can be considered a reaction to the new atheism/aggressive scientism of thinkers like Dawkins. If scientism proceeds as if there is nothing outside of science’s authoritative judgement, and if a scientistic approach to evolution is being used to wage open war against theism, it is perhaps inevitable that this would provoke a pushback attempt to seek God in science. Collins’s opinion regarding the importance of new atheism for the intelligent design movement might be questioned by asking whether Dawkins is really that influential. I would readily concede that the aggressively anti-religious aspect of his writings is not representative of the work of the vast majority of evolutionary biologists. However, unlike most scientists, he is an amazingly popular author and an undeniable public intellectual, and he has plenty of open disciples and collaborators. In addition, his outlook seems to have much institutional support. Dawkins was the University of Oxford’s Professor for the Public Understanding of Science from 1995 to 2008. If this doesn’t mark Dawkins as an establishment figure, I don’t know what would. If Collins’s opinion regarding the new atheism’s relationship to ID has some validity, then it would seem to follow that the most effective way for those who view the ID movement with dismay to take the wind out of its sails would be to crusade against the aggressive scientism represented by Dawkins as much as they do against the books produced by the Discovery Institute.Dawkins’s aggressive, anti-theistic approach to the topic of evolution can be distinguished from the evolutionary theory he champions. The fact that Dawkins dubiously wields the issue of design as a club against theism says nothing regarding the truth or falsity of neo-darwinism. Personally, though I believe in evolution understood as common descent with modification, I am open to the idea that perhaps neo-darwinian mechanisms are less important for understanding evolution than mainstream evolutionary biology takes them to be. My general sense is that Jerry Fodor is probably right when he says that Darwin did for natural history what Marx did for history generally by placing it under control of a “theory,” and that such 19c optimism in the power of science was misplaced, since “history, whether natural or otherwise, is par excellence the locus of explanations that do not conform to the Newtonian paradigm.” (An aside on Fodor: It should go without saying that although Fodor thinks it wrong to conceive of random mutation/natural selection-or any other set of mechanisms- as the engine that drives evolution, he does think there are obviously plenty of persuasive adaptationist accounts for particular episodes in natural history.) If Fodor is correct, then darwinism itself represents a form of scientism, though certainly in a milder, less culturally imperialistic form than Dawkins’s anti-theistic version. However, if it is assumed that evolutionary science can conquer natural history by placing it under control of a theory, it is not much of a leap to assume that evolutionary science can conquer anything else it has a mind to.Regardless of whether or not neo-darwinism represents a form of scientism, and irrespective of the theory’s scientific merits, reading Dawkins helped me to better appreciate ways in which neo-darwinism proves resistant to criticism. On pg. 91 of The Blind Watchmaker, Dawkins says that “One Hundred and twenty years on, we know a lot more about animals and plants than Darwin did, and still not a single case is known to me of a complex organ that could not have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications.” This sounds like quite impressive support for Darwin’s theory. Yet near the very end of the book, Dawkins baldly states that “No matter how improbable it is that an X could have arisen from a Y in a single step, it is always possible to conceive of a series of infinitesimally graded intermediates between them.” (p.317) The first quote doesn’t seem so impressive in light of the second. Surely, no theory is self-validating. However, with neo-darwinism, certain evidentiary concerns do tend to be shrugged off as if to say “it is always possible to conceive.” For instance, given the mind bogglingly large time frames Dawkins emphasizes that evolution relies on, it is plausible to say to the critics that it is unrealistic to expect that we’ll ever be able to model in much detail how certain complex structures likely emerged. Relatedly, the fossil record that one could argue leaves much to be desired from a neo-darwinian point of view is necessarily an incomplete window into the past. So, for someone who already assumes that darwinism is sound, the lack of specificity regarding pathways to complexity and the problematic fossil record need not disturb assumptions, because there are built-in responses for dealing with them. This is an effective practical way to blunt criticism. Furthermore, anyone somewhat skeptical of mainstream evolutionary thinking who rules out intelligent design as science really has no generally effective retort to Dawkins’s proclamation in TBW that “The theory of evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only theory we know of that is in principle capable of explaining the existence of organized complexity.” (pg. 317) Now, precisely because I tend to agree with Fodor that the notion of any one overarching theory of evolution is misguided, I think that the development of other credible theories is a necessary requirement for breaking the spell of darwinian hegemony. Self organization theory seems to me to hold some promise for explaining the existence of organized complexity, and Dawkins did not deal with self organization theory as a potential rival in his book, probably because Stuart Kauffman had yet to write his self-organization texts by 1986. Even so, as is commonly said, self-organization is as of yet more slogan than reality. One might try replying to Dawkins that just because the critics of neo-darwinism have no satisfying alternate explanation, that doesn’t mean that the establishment theory is sound. However, this approach is not likely to change many minds. Also, since the only Darwin doubters who do claim to have a satisfying explanation for organized complexity are creationists of some sort, simply to question mainstream evolutionary thinking is to invite hostility on the assumption that such questioning ultimately aids the creationists. (Fodor’s personal example is instructive here.) One sees this dynamic at work in TBW. Dawkins very sincerely views dissenters from neo-darwinism with suspicion and/or wariness, because he thinks they are motivated by, or at least will be exploited by, a scientifically discredited but still troublesomely influential creationist point of view. I am obviously no fan of Dawkins, but I’m glad I read TBW. Dawkins is a good writer, and has an almost evangelical enthusiasm for his topic. These qualities made it fairly easy to get through the book: it was not an unenjoyable read. In addition, Dawkins’s book-though more that 30 years old-was scientifically informative in certain respects for this lay reader. Also, since Dawkins really has achieved the status of a public intellectual, reading this book gives one insight into how many people think about evolution and its cultural implications. Relatedly, Dawkins’s aggressive anti-theistic scientism raises a whole host of issues and questions worth thinking about. Finally, reading Dawkins helped me better appreciate that whatever valid criticisms one can make regarding mainstream evolutionary theory, those hoping for or even anticipating some sort of major paradigm shift should probably not hold their breath."
496,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2520231-sophie,4,"I was worried that this would be a difficult read because the last time I felt confident about my knowledge of the natural sciences was in like the 10th grade, but it was a really, really good read. Dawkins is much more interesting and enjoyable when he writes about his field of expertise than when he writes about religion. I mean, I'm an atheist and I think what he argues for in The God Delusion is pretty much on the mark, but in hindsight the difference between that book and this one is massive. His arguments in The God Delusion are often quite poor and simplistic (see: 'Here are three ways in which religion has unique, specific harms: *proceeds to list three things which are in no way unique to religion*' and the debater in me groans.) I think people are usually at their best when they get to talk about things they are passionate about (and not in a bitter way.) His enthusiasm for the wonders of nature really comes through, and you can tell he put a lot of thought into how best to discuss various concepts in lay terms. I was baffled by the computer program biomorphs at the beginning and was afraid that whatever noodling you could get down to on a mid-80s Mac would be hopelessly irrelevant today, but they turned out to be an excellent source for metaphors to understand natural selection, a thread wound cleverly throughout the book. I also liked the fact that he discussed some rival theories to neo-Darwinism in later chapters, both current and historical, but wasted no more than a few words on creationism, which is about as much as it deserves. (He did highlight the way creationists try to publicly hijack any *seemingly* anti-Darwinian ideas brough up in the scientific community, which is important.)Overall a very accessible and compelling book, will probs come back to it every now and then. (The bits about bats are amazing. Bats are amazing.)"
497,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Evolution is not for everyone. In a way, it is also faith and Dawkins is an ardent preacher. He makes excellent arguments on how evolution works on well-hidden axioms. Some of the concepts described in the book are astounding - like the concepts of cumulative selection or the vastness of time. The lucidity with which the basic message is hammered repeatedly, along with diversity of examples and interspersing of tales from other fields make the book a truly magnificent read. Even the ardent evolution non-believers are likely to walk away with many questions if they read the book dispassionately. Yet, the book suffers from two faults: most of the book appears like an attack on the arguments of god- or religion-believers rather than a good science by itself. Texts describing any good theories should spend most of the time elaborating itself rather than creating supposed critiques' strawmen and shooting them down. The book also tends to attack the most average religious arguments rather than those more evolved.The bigger problem is the book's inability to recognize the axioms that lie at the heart of evolution theory. Whether Euclidean or Big Bang, every theory starts perforce starts with hypotheses that can not be proven. If there is any god, a believer can argue, he is the one setting those axioms. The rest may simply build on itself, in the most fanatic case with a minor bit of divine intervention here and there. While the presence or absence of axioms of a certain kind can never prove or disprove any creator, a good rationalist like Dawkins should have spelled the axioms of the evolutionary theory better.All that said, this is a great book for anyone who is not a specialist in the field."
498,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82803739-antonio,4,"Having read 'The Selfish Gene' prior to 'The Blind Watchmaker', I already knew Dawkins' writing style, and I (roughly) knew what to expect from this book.I found Dawkin's explanation of Darwinism clear and accessible, its keypoints recurrently repeated over the entire book so there would be no mistake the reader (even the one not trained in biology) could put off the book and walk away with a wrong idea about evolution and natural selection. I thoroughly enjoyed the chapters about echolocation and about the idea of life originating from 'clay-crystals replicators' (which I never encountered before although I am trained in biology, and which put my imagination under consistent stress), as well as the one about the arms races, BUT (yes, there is a but) I was not expecting to find myself tangled in the countless arguments Dawkins uses to prove his point against other theories proposed to explain evolution, which were at times tedious and boring. Neverthless, I think Dawkins felt compelled to tackle the subject as comprehensively as possible and I am sure that the book would have been diminished if he decided to omit at least some of those arguments, reason why I feel I can forgive him (not completely, though) for the hard time he gave me when going past certain chapters, especially the last two.Overall, I think 'The Blind Watchmaker' can be an interesting and illuminating read for anyone eager to understand the real workings of evolution and selection, with the warning that the reader may sometimes need to equip himself with a good pair of 'mental running shoes' (as Dawkins says in the books) and a good deal of patience to get through some parts which may feel unnecessary and boring."
499,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41603992-abraham,5,"The undeniably amazing complexity of living organisms has been taken as incontrovertible evidence for the existence of a divine being who intelligently designed every life form here on earth (along with the whole rest of the universe). In 'The Blind Watchmaker', Richard Dawkins argues that this complexity is actually the result of the cumulative selection, over millions of years, of genes which conferred survival and reproductive benefits on their phenotypes.Such benefits could have been absolutely tiny - imagine the eyes of two creatures, one pair of which focused milliseconds quicker than the other, allowing their possessor to start fleeing a predator fractionally quicker and thereby living to reproduce another day. Nonetheless, over time they add up to create the complex organisms that currently populate our planet.After making this main point, Dawkins discusses various nuances - for example, is the rate of adaptation steady over time, or does it happen in fits and starts, and in keeping with environmental changes? After this, he debunks some interesting alternative theories, not limited to creationism. Lamarckism stood out for me - the idea that physical characteristics you acquire during your life (for example, the large muscles of a body-builder) can be passed on to your offspring - this theory was popular not for its (non-existent) scientific credibility but because it tied in neatly with certain political ethoses of the day - for example, communism with its heroic muscular workers etc etc. That factor is probably a whole subject in itself - reading recommendations welcome! "
500,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7188699-abhaga,3,"After fussing over for the longest time about which Richard Dawkins book to read, I picked this one up. Turns out, not a great choice.The book is informative and also gives you a good idea of basic evolution process in first 3-4 chapters. But there are two major problems. One is that many of the later chapters are written as responses to specific challenges and questions posed by opponents or different groups within evolutionists. The responses are well crafted and satisfactory but you have no idea if those are the major questions or difficulties faced by the theory of evolution - things that it struggles to explain. This is not a fault of the book but for this reason, I will not recommend this as the first book to read about Evolution.Second problem is with the repetitive, rambling writing style of Dawkins. He repeats the same thing so many times that it starts getting on your nerves. I even took to cursory reading in some places after a while. I understand that he is writing as an apologist but to a convert looking for deeper understanding, it sounds like preaching to the choir.But those two niggles aside, he destroys critics and objections pretty thoroughly, sticking in multiple pins even when the first one would have done the job. In that sense, he allows you to develop a deeper and well rounded understanding of Evolutionary worldview. I am looking forward to reading his other books as well, hoping he has done a better job of writing those."
501,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19027675-keith,2,"I just found a copy of The Blind Watchmaker, Why the evidence for evolution reveals a universe without design, at a library sale and began reading it. Besides being 30 years out of date (which may or may not be relevant), it is annoyingly written. Dawkins wrote in a drunken sailor’s walk way (with frequent parentheticals (of which more later)) with frequent (and often interrupted) digressions. Those last sentences are positively cogent by his standards, but illustrative of the scattered style. I found myself skipping paragraphs as soon as I had sussed their gist rather than slogging through them endlessly. No matter what the blurbs say, The Blind Watchmaker was not easy reading because it so undirected. Really, you can talk about an “arms race” without devoting so much ink to suggesting that your analogy could be about the USA and USSR, but doesn’t necessarily have to have named participants nor do they need to have those exact ideologies. Unfortunately, Richard Dawkins couldn’t in this book. Perhaps he needed to give more credit to the reader’s intelligence.Much of the book is spent on Dawkins’ disagreements with other evolutionists, such as Eldridge and Gould (punctuated equilibrium), Dover (molecular drive) and schools of taxonomy. The made up dialog between his impression of a real-life and an extreme caricature Darwinists failed to entertain or enlighten.I would have given The Blind Watchmaker a higher rating had I not been worn down by Dawkins’ style and disorganization."
502,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11507273-hasan,5,"Richard Dawkins wrote this book in order to show how the complexity of life on earth could have arisen by the apparently blind and ""random"" forces of nature. The catch of course being that evolution by natural selection is anything but random since organisms that are better suited to survive and reproduce tend to saturate the environment with copies of themselves and while the specific advantages that some individuals might enjoy over their peers might come from random mutations, natural selection decidedly is not random. On the way we meet a number of theories that have been posited as alternatives to Neo-Darwinism and we find ourselves dealing with the explanatory power of these rival theories and in some cases, the astronomical odds against some part of these theories being true. This book might not be the best for someone who believes that evolution by natural selection is true especially if one is familiar with the basic arguments that might be presented in favour of the theory. And while I would consider myself in this group, I certainly learned a great deal from this book. Perhaps my idea of skeptically examining every argument put forth by Dawkins did pay off. I am thinking of reading Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea next. I tried reading it before but perhaps I will find it more illuminating this time around. It might be a good place for other readers of this book to continue their investigation into this topic too. "
503,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,4,"I could have never imagined that reading about biology and evolution can be such a delight. The subject is presented in a structured and simple enough (to an extent possible) way, topped with the poetic style of Dawkins. I cannot help admiring Dawkins more and more for promoting reason and evidence above everything else when it comes to matters of science. The book is essentially an answer to a very common argument against the theory of evolution, which goes like this ""How could have an organ so complex as a heart/eye/brain/wings/etc.. have evolved by random mutation and natural selection? Unless all the composite parts of that organ were all at the same time present, this organ would have been useless for the animal"". I myself used to wonder about this a lot, which is one of the reasons in picked up the book. It was very fulfilling to find the clear answers supported by evidence to most of my questions. There are no attempts to trick, confuse, appeal to your on beliefs...just plain evidence, fact, knowledge. The reason I am giving this book 4 stars is because, for me, the subject of speciation was not adequately addressed. This particular gap for me will have to be filled by another book apparently. "
504,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/520483-serene,4,"Dawkins has a down-to-earth, humorous at times, way of explaining difficult concepts in a simple manner. His presentation of evolution as traveling through a ""space"" of animals, his discussion of Cairns-Smith's theory of the origin of life, and his explanation of the variable rates that evolution might proceed at were all fascinating. I understood evolution much better after reading this, particularly on the genetic level (which my high-school education treated only lightly.)Except for the occasional pot-shot, he stays out of discussing religion at all, which is just as well, because I don't think he quite gets it. For example, he says that God is not an acceptable explanation of the complexity of the universe because He would already have to be more complex than what he created. But the faithful don't claim to have a 100% comprehensive delineation of all of existence any more that Darwinism can claim to be completely comprehensive. Apparently he has a hard time accepting that there may be some things we may never know."
505,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2242165-tyler,2,"I'm a little disappointed here. This was my introduction to Richard Dawkins, and maybe I just picked the wrong book. I was hoping to learn more about the fascinating world of evolutionary biology, but instead got a long-winded, all-over-the-map apologetic response to Creationism and various oddities like Lamarckism and Punctuationism.This really is an odd book, with the first hundred pages or so mostly devoted to Dawkins's own little computer programming exercise to demonstrate how cumulative selection works. It was still fun reading in parts, especially when he talks about specific animal traits such as echolocation in bats, or the development of the eye in different organisms. I may come back to Dawkins again, maybe The Ancestor's Tale or The Selfish Gene or something. I suppose this book serves its purpose in defending Darwinism against those who feel threatened by it, but if you're well past that already you can probably pass on this book as well."
506,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2692649-aron,2,"I don't really know why I read this. I don't disagree with anything Dawkins is claiming, so don't take this poor rating as meaning his book is full of errors or that I dislike him/his claims. It just did a very, consistently good job of putting me to sleep. There was a small section of the book (a chapter or two) that I would give five stars to that discussed the origins of self-replication and mutation in non-living substances like clay. It was extremely thought-provoking and (ABSOLUTELY KEY) wasn't something I was already familiar with. The chapter on positive feedback, which focused on non-useful traits that could only be related to sexual attraction, was also reasonably interesting, if a bit drawn out. But most of it was extremely dry.My guess is that this book was fresh information when it was published in 1986, but even as someone with very little formal education in biology, in 2014, 90% of it just wasn't worth my time.

Evolution is awesome! We have a lot to learn from it."" That said, the last 2-3 chapters felt like a bit of a drag and were a little hard to understand; maybe they'll make more sense on the 2nd reading.

This is definitely not light reading, but for anyone doubtful of the truth of Darwinism and evolution by natural selection, or for believers who just want to know more, this is great.It's basically an argument for how evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only rational argument out there that can explain how the first replicating cells gave rise to organised complexity in the form of living things, in all our diversity, which all have structures and/or organs well-suited to that organism's particular environment and that therefore improve the probability of survival and reproduction of the responsible genes.Intelligent design seems like a reasonable explanation if you don't have the scientific knowledge to provide alternative reasoning. With the relevant scientific knowledge, as we are privileged to now have, natural selection makes sense. And it is awesome, literally."

So many pages are used for this that I forget the point.Second readSometimes you forget that you already read a book. I couldn't remember anything of it. A good reread, because now I wasn't annoyed by the examples. Quite interesting, it is really written from the point of view that Darwin's evolution theory is the only one that can be true. Also funny to read that he is really expecting wonderful things from moleculair research. 30 Years later a lot has happenend in this world, so it is good to remind that Darwin theory is still standing.

Next on my list is ""The extended phenotype"" and I hope that, by reading more and more books about this topic (and preferably written by Dawkins), I will conclude that the new books are only a little bit less challenging than the previous book of Richard Dawkins.

512,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14697853-james,3,Natural selection is very logical and it is a good start but it is still a theory since the time scales are unobservable on a human level it's very difficult to prove.

""The Blind Watchmaker"" was first published in the UK in 1986. It explains the theory of evolution in detail from a theoretical perspective. The term ""clock and watch"" in the title of this book is a metaphor for living things, emphasizing that the structure and function of living things are complicated and ingenious. The ""Watchmaker"" in the title is borrowed from the famous monograph ""Natural Theology"" by William Paley, the 18th century theologian. Richard Dawkins was born in Nairobi, Kenya in 1941. He received a Bachelor of Zoology, Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science from Oxford University. He is one of the most famous and outspoken atheists and evolutionists still alive today. He has the title masterpieces of ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" (Darwin's Rottweiler): ""The Selfish Gene"", ""Blind Watchmaker"" "", ""Evidence of Evolution"", ""Ancestor's Story"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Impossible2. Good design3. Progressive change4. Animal Space5. Gene file6. What a heaven7. Creative evolution8. Sex selection9. Disease? Gradient?10. Tree of Life Philosophers are thinking about 3 questions: Who am I? Where am i from Where am i going? In fact, biologists are studying these three issues. Even today, biologists cannot tell us clearly how every part of the human body works? How did humans and other creatures be born and become what they are today? Where is the end of biological evolution? I have read a series of books called ""Earth Chronicles"". This series of books has been published since 1976. The author Xiqin's explanation of the origin of mankind is the result of intelligent biological intervention. But until today, in fact, for a long period of time in the future, I have no way to firmly believe in any view of this ""natural evolution"" or ""creation theory"" . I sometimes think like this: If human beings were created by other intelligent creatures, where did those intelligent creatures come from? Even if they were created, this cycle should have an end, and the creator at the end should be more intelligent than human beings. If the creator at the end was born in heaven and earth (is it equivalent to evolution?), then since more intelligent creatures can evolve naturally, it is entirely possible for humans to evolve naturally. Specifically, whether you believe that human beings were created by God, female snails, extraterrestrial intelligent creatures, or any intelligent life, then the question that follows is, who created these creators? It is undoubtedly hard to convince people to make a conclusion that ""the creator naturally arises from the universe, or the creator is the starting point of the universe"" assertively. Because creators are more advanced than human beings, the possibility of them naturally occurring should be smaller. Even today, physics tells us that the universe originated in the Big Bang, so we will also have this question, what was before the Big Bang? What caused the Big Bang? The term ""watchmaker"" comes from the 18th century theologian Perry's ""Natural Theology"". Perry said that if you find a stone in a deserted area, you can easily accept the idea of ""it's always here""; but when you find a watch in a deserted area, You almost never think ""it's always here"". So, since the watch can not occur spontaneously in nature, that it far more complex human and other biological clocks, not to appear spontaneously in nature. Therefore, there must be a role such as a ""watchmaker"", who created humans and other lives. Dawkins believes that this ""watchmaker"" is the physical law of nature itself, and this law governs the completion of evolution. The laws of physics have no purpose, so they are ""blind"" or ""blind."" Each of us has a tendency to experience miracles when faced with highly complex machines. Try to recall the first time you heard that AlphaGo defeated the strongest Go player in humans, or the Atlas humanoid robot learned the feeling of backflip. This makes us instinctively unacceptable to the concept of evolution. It is difficult for us to imagine how the laws of physics without autonomous consciousness can lead to orderly results. However, Darwinists tell us that the process of evolution took billions of years to complete, and each of us cannot really understand what such a long time means, and this has created another great difficulty for our understanding. It is precisely because of the huge differences in time measurement scales that many hypotheses in modern biology and geography were ridiculed by almost everyone when they were first proposed. If we look at the concept of evolution in a broader sense, can the 300-year period since humans entered an industrial society count as evolution? Although our genes have hardly changed, the changes in human society from organizational structure to production capacity may be far more than 30,000 years. If such a cliff-like evolution can be completed in 300 years, what does 300 million years mean for the evolution of organisms? From inorganic matter to the creation of intelligent creatures that can send spacecraft into outer space, is 300 million years enough? Those of us who have received nine years of compulsory education know that genes are the basis of the inheritance of every organism. In the genetic process of genes, non-directional mutations may occur randomly, but natural selection has a direction. Evolution seems to be accomplished through such infinitely many cumulative choices. The long period of time makes the gradual accumulation of choices almost infinitely many times, each time the change is so small that you can almost think that the difference is infinitely small. Here we need to have a certain understanding of the concept of limit, which once again caused a barrier to understanding. The author is not only a biologist, but also has some experience in programming. He described in detail the results shown by an evolutionary program he wrote. The results show that as long as you determine some basic rules, set the possibility of random mutations in the system, and finally add a certain tendency selection (such as artificial selection), the final result may seem to have a certain law, it seems to be It was designed artificially. Because evolution is gradually completed, a natural doubt will follow. Why are these intermediate steps or intermediate states of organisms not eliminated? Many organs or tissues are obviously interdependent. In other words, if they appear alone, they are basically useless ; if they appear at the same time , they can play a huge role. Human organs are so sophisticated, like a huge machine, it will stop working immediately if any link is missing. Before other links that need to be used as assistance have not yet evolved, this incomplete machine is not only unable to perform its functions, but also a huge burden. Why is it not discarded, but retained, as if purposefully waiting for the last one Is the evolution of parts completed? Understanding the three questions at the beginning, whether understood in a philosophical or biological sense, may actually be meaningless for the survival of a single organism. However, the expression of certain DNA in human genes seems to determine that some people will be full of enthusiasm and curiosity about these issues. This curiosity about the unknown engraved in genes, no matter how time passes, will always continue in the human population with the help of certain individuals. "" Once I was invited to a university debate association to debate with creationists. I still remember the shock I felt. After the debate, we had dinner together. My next seat was a young lady who was in the debate. Representing a creationist, the speech is fairly powerful. I don’t think she will be a creationist, so I asked her to answer me honestly why she would speak on behalf of the creationist. She admitted that she was just honing her debate skills. I find it more challenging to defend my unconvinced position. It seems that the University Debate Association does this. The person participating in the debate is designated to defend which side, regardless of their beliefs. Their beliefs have no place in the debate. I'm not good at speaking to the public. I came all the way to attend because I believe the topic I was invited to defend is true. I found that the people of the Debating Association only used the topic of the debate as an introduction to the debate game, so I decided not to accept the invitation of the Debating Association. Issues involving scientific truth should not allow false arguments. "" Before I entered university in high school, I was very interested in the sense of debate. And he did join the debate team in his freshman year. Later, I immediately found out that I needed to defend my objection. Although intellectually I can understand that this is done to make myself more critical thinking. But emotionally it was difficult to accept, so I only participated in one or two debates, then withdrew from the debate team, and never joined the debate association ever since. "" What I want to argue is that no matter where the complex things in the universe appear, the explanation may be roughly the same; it applies to us, chimpanzees, worms, oak trees, and monsters in outer space. On the other hand, for what I call "" ""Simple"" things, such as rocks, clouds, rivers, galaxies and quarks. These are all things in physics. Chimpanzees, dogs, bats, cockroaches, people, insects, dandelions, bacteria and aliens, It's a thing of biology. The difference lies in the complexity of the design. Biology studies complex things, and those things feel like they were designed for a certain purpose. Physics studies simple things, and they don't make us feel ""designed"" at all. At first glance, artificial objects such as computers and cars seem to be exceptions. They are very complex and obviously designed, but they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic, not flesh and blood. But in this book, I will firmly regard them as biological research objects. "" "" If we find such a clock in the wild, even if we don't know how it appeared, its precise and complex design will force us to conclude: this clock must have a manufacturer; it must be in some time and place. There is a craftsman or a group of craftsmen who, for a certain purpose-we find that the purpose is indeed achieved-made it; the maker knows how to make a clock and designs its use. Perry insists that no one can reasonably refute this conclusion. Even atheists will come to this conclusion when thinking about natural works, because: every sign of ingenuity, every design expression, not only exists in clocks, works of nature There are both; the difference between the two is that natural works show greater ingenuity, more complex designs, beyond the degree of artificial products, it is difficult to count. "" "" The simulation of the telescope and the eye, the simulation of the clock and the living thing, is wrong. The opposite of the appearance is correct. The only watchmaker in nature is the blind force of physics, but those forces condense and operate in a very special way. And the truth The watchmaker had a foresight: in his mind, he had a future purpose. He designed gears and clockwork and planned the connection between them. Darwin discovered a blind, unconscious, and automatic process, all biological Existence and seemingly purposeful constructions, we now know that can be explained by this process, this is natural selection. Natural Selection has no purpose in its heart. Natural Selection has no intention or mind. Natural Selection does not plan for the future. Natural Selection has no vision. There is no foresight, not even vision. If Natural Selection is a watchmaker in nature, it must be a blind watchmaker. "" This evolutionary force is a bit similar to the way computers produce artificial intelligence today . In fact, for the algorithm, it just keeps repeating some operations according to certain rules . It is for its lack of understanding of what does and does not know these things will lead where it leads. "" We want to find a precise way to define ""complex"". Some things we think are complicated, how can we be more precise? We want to find out what people, moles, earthworms, airplanes, clocks and watches have in common, and what they have in common with milk jelly , Mount Brown, and the moon. The answer we got is: complex things have certain properties, which are prescribed in advance, and it is extremely unlikely that they can be created simply randomly. As far as living things are concerned, the prescribed properties are In this sense, it means ""smart""; or it is the mastery of a specific ability such as flying, if judged by an aeronautical engineer; or the mastery of a relatively general ability, such as avoiding death or spreading by reproduction Gene. "" "" Non-living things don’t do this work, except for artificial machines-we have agreed to treat them as honorable creatures. Non-living things accept the forces that balance them with the environment at their mercy. Mount Brown has been around for a long time, I Knowing that it may continue to exist for a while, but it will not try to live. If the rock lies somewhere under the influence of gravity, it will lie there. It can continue to lie there without having to do anything. Brown The peak exists now and will continue to exist until the wind and rain abraded it, or it collapsed by an earthquake. It will not take measures to repair the erosion, cracks, or recover after the earthquake collapses. The biological body will be. Non-biological bodies just obey physics. The general law of learning. "" "" I care about is: whether we put what I call the"" complex ""nature of what is called, it is an important nature, require time-consuming it is to explain biological matter. Characteristic body and biological objects with physical objects Differentiate. The explanation we put forward must not contradict the laws of physics. Our explanation will use the laws of physics, and only the laws of physics. But the way we use the laws of physics is very special, and it is generally not discussed in physics textbooks. That special way is Darwin's way. "" In fact, the interpretation method used by the author can be understood as the "" Pyramid Principle "" . In order to support his final argument , he needs some arguments. These arguments are at the higher levels of the pyramid . For example , explain the functions of the human body at the organ level .

518,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7856222-alexandru,5,A good insight on the theory of evolution. It is a pity that I did not have access to this book when I was in school. I might of chose a different path for my life.
519,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17108975-odi-shonga,4,"Contrary to the implication of the subtitle, this book isn't just an attack on creationism. In fact, it's a sweeping defence of Darwinian natural selection against various opponents, with creationism probably taken the least seriously (but addressed all the same).Once more, Dawkins manages to treat you as a sophistacted reader, while somehow never falling prey to the curse of knowledge (where experts are bad at explaining because they fail to gauge the right level of background knowledge or interest their reader has). Dawkins proves himself to be a supreme writer once again, never failing to convey the difficult in a graspable and uncondescending way.The crux of the book is that evolution by natural selection is the only way to explain the organised complexity of life. This is because the chance of organised, living complexity arising in one leap is propesterously unlikely, so it would have to be gradual. Then, of the gradual ways complex life could arise, all rival theories fall flat. Some theories that are dispensed with include: the blue-print theory of trait inheritence, where traits that are well-used get passed down, as though saved onto a genetic blue-print; the mutation-first theory of evolution, where random mutations guide evolutionary improvement, not natural pressures or a combination of both; and others that, if I had a better memory, I'd be able to list here for you, but I don't, so you get a shitty half-baked summary instead -- sorry. Anyway, if you don't really buy mythology, but you want a creation story that's backed by reason and evidence, you want to read this and The Selfish Gene. It does occur to me that Dawkins is basically an evangelist for Darwinism, and I am basically a convert. But hey, we all have to believe in something, don't we? Rather this sprawling web of intricate connections and relatedness -- a world of variegated beings united -- than an odd mythology that encourages obedience, fear, and chauvinism, and that probably isn't true."

I haven't studied Biology for over 30 years and I gave up because they kept trying to make me draw an eye. I was terrible at drawing eyes. So I got as much of this as my brain was able to process and there was a ton of goodness, but I could have done with more anecdotes and slightly less God-bashing. I get that God-bashing is Dawkins' superpower, but his arguments for natural selection stand on their own without them having to be a refutation."
521,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8507732-avishek-khan,5,"Just when I thought I'd had enough of this topic of evolutionary biology and should start reading the ""important"" stuff that would be effective for my career, and thus, buy me money, the idea occurred to me - why not give this book a last try before diving into the shitpile of serious things? ""After all, you've been thinking about reading the book for the last 10 years, Avishek. Why not now? Just get it over with and then do what-fucking-ever you wanted to do,"" I told myself. And then I realized my mistake.It's not reading the book that the mistake was, it's in fact not reading the book for such a long time. Why should I, though? It's a very old book, written 30 years ago which is bound to have backdated facts and incomplete pieces of information whereas I've already read Why Evolution Is True (2009) by Jerry A. Coyne, Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (2008) by my Facebook friend Neil Shubin, Nick Lane's Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution (2009), and Dawkins' recent work The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution (2009). And above all, there's The Selfish Gene, which is like the bible to me, containing (almost) all the answers I need regarding life and other shitty little things. But little did I know that I had so much yet to know. (facepalm)The title of the book could reasonably have been ""The Blind Watchmaker And How She Does Her Job"". Before depicting the image of this watchmaker, an allusion to William Paley's infamous ""Watchmaker"" argument for the so-called ""complex design"" of the living things, Dawkins first went on to define the idea of ""complexity"" and ""design"", since the main thesis of the book is to demonstrate how natural selection alone can give rise to the apparent design of complex life forms. Then he got straight onto explaining what natural selection is and how it works with his mind-boggling ability to use simple and easy to conceive analogies with numerous examples (Paley's favorite one - the human eye - being the first) and his own simplistic computer simulation of evolution. In his signature style, like a great teacher as he always is, Dawkins painstakingly brought up example after example of animal adaptations and explained each and every one of them from an evolutionary perspective in such a way that is guaranteed to plant the idea of natural selection deep inside your brain that you can never get rid of. And once you understand it fully, there's no denying the inevitability of the ""miraculously"" complex design that we see around us today.The first 8 chapters contain the essence of the book. The last three chapters are merely an extension where Dawkins brought up a few alternative hypotheses to Darwinism and decisively destroyed them in style. To me, this is where the book became kind of monotonous and boring. Nevertheless, I guess it was necessary to make it complete.Of all the books on evolution I read, this one ponders into the idea of evolution in the most elaborate manner which will introduce the reader to the Darwinian way of thinking and leave him/her conceptually enlightened. It's a must-read for every science enthusiast out there, especially if you're new to the idea of evolution and looking for good materials to start learning, this should be the first pop-science book to read."
522,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/177596-oceana2602,3,"Oh, this is a difficult review. I feel as if I need to explain my own view about religion before I can properly review this book, but honestly, I don't care much for discussing religion on the internet, in a book review. So, to make it short, I'm an atheist. In fact, (and to quote Douglas Adams, because it's always good to quote Douglas Adams), I'm a radical atheist.Which makes reading this book kinda like preaching to the choir.That's probably the reason why I didn't really enjoy it. That, and the pseudo-scientific approach. The author is so eagerly trying to convince me of his views on evolution, he goes into great detail explaining evolution to me (unfortunately, he assumes that I know nothing about evolution, thus explaining it in tiny little baby steps that leave out the interesting ""real"" science). He says, look, evolution, it works! It's right! This is what happened! BELIEVE ME!And yes, sure, I believe him. No wait, I don't believe him. I know for a fact that what he says, well, not particularly what he says, but I know for a fact that evolution is true.See, where I'm from, nobody doubts that evolution isn't true. nobody would even suggest that ""creation"" is a real, scientific alternative to evolution. In 31 years and with a post-grad degree, I have never met anyone who would have doubted evolution.So the whole purpose of this book is completely baffling to me.It's not enough of a science book to really teach about evolution. And it's not combative enough to actually come right out and say ""there is no creation."" The only thing the author does is show that evolution works - the important step, the step that says ""and not only does it work, but here, let me show you why there is no god involved in it either"", he leaves out.I know I'm so disappointed with this book because that last thing was what I expected. I expected someone to write about why creation doesn't work, not why evolution does. That's not the authors fault.I might give another one of his books a try, but it'll probably have the same effect - we already have the same opinion (or close enough, I guess), for me to find his books interesting, provocative or even thought-provoking. I feel as if the book only deserves two stars (""it was okay""), but I'll add another one for the effort.they may have an entirely different effect on you, though, so I still recommend you read one. And if you do, ""The Blind Watchmaker"" would certainly not be a bad choice."
523,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"A great read that explains evolution, natural selection, darwinism, and why these are not only the theories most strongly supported by the evidence, but also why they are the only theories we have that, in principle, could even begin to explain the existence of life. Dawkins takes a complicated subject—in fact, many subjects, including biology, chemistry, physics, math, probability, programming, geology, and more—and manages to explain them in a clear, approachable way that can be understood by just about any educated person.There are lots of wonderful insights and explanations in the book:* The physical ""shape"" of an object is enough to create order from disorder. For example, consider a natural sieve—that is, any item that just happens to have a small hole in it. Small objects will tend to go through the hole and large objects will not. The result is that items get sorted by size. We get order from disorder, but no designer was involved! Similarly, the ""shape"" of biological devices can create order, and the key idea behind life is that certain molecules can create copies of themselves solely because if their ""shape"" and normal physical/chemical processes. It seems highly orderly, but no designer is necessary to make this order possible.* The book goes through a few possible theories for how life could've started on earth—how these initial self-replicating ""shapes"" could've formed. One interesting idea was that life developed from clay crystals (silicates). These crystals live in river beds and take various shapes based on the flow of the water and the other crystals they touch. Occasionally, the crystals just happen to form a shape that tends to stick together very well and as more clay runs into this shape, it clumps up more and more, and eventually forms a small dam in the river. This causes stagnant pools of water to form near these dams and, during the dry season, these pools dry up. The clay also dries, cracks, and then wind blows this crystalline structure around, like spores. Some of these crystals end up in other rivers, where their shape cause clumping to happen again, creating more of the same ""shapes"", and repeating the entire process with dams, pools, and drying. In other words, the shape of these clay crystals allows them to ""replicate"" themselves. * Of course, clay crystals are inorganic, but perhaps the organic molecules that are the building blocks of modern life were able to somehow build on top of the replication abilities of these inorganic crystals. For example, some organic material that happened to be in the river may have bonded with the clay, changed its shape in some way that happened to increase the odds of the clay replicating, and now not only are clay crystals being replicated from river to river, but the organic molecules also come along for the ride. Eventually, the organic molecules may be all that's necessary. * But how could the order and complexity of modern life arise from such ""random"" events? What are the odds that clay silicates blowing in the wind leads to something as intricate as the human eye? The book has a great discussion on the probability of life, with two key points: the odds of something as complicated as an eye forming are so vanishingly small as to effectively be impossible; but the odds of the basic building blocks of life forming, given that those building blocks are much, much simpler than the eye, are much higher. Those odds may still be low, but not impossibly low, and given that there are billions of planets and billions of years, even fairly unlikely events can happen.* A key second argument around the idea of ""random"" events leading to complex, orderly organisms is that while the events (i.e., mutations) are random, the selection process is not! In particularly, it's not that complexity appeared randomly, in one giant leap, going from a simple replicator to a fully-formed eye, but rather, that what we're seeing is adaptive complexity, where complexity increases step by step, generation after generation. Each change is a tiny increment that happens randomly, and if it happens to increase the chances of replication, it will be passed down to future generations. * Dawkins gives lots of examples to highlight the difference between single-step theories vs multi-step theories. One example is based on the infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters theorem. In fact, Dawkins suggests a simpler version: how long would a single monkey typing randomly at a single typewriter take to come up with just one specific sentence from Shakespeare? If each sentence was written separately and with no relation to previous sentences (""single-step""), the odds are extraordinarily low—even with a very fast monkey (that is, a computer program simulating a monkey), it would take longer than the age of the universe. But now imagine instead the monkey starts with one sentence, and at each step makes a bunch of variations on the sentence, each with random mutations to it. Then, some ""selection pressure"" (e.g., a computer) selects the sentence that, in some way, resembles the chosen Shakespeare sentence the most, and the process repeats. With this ""multi-step"" process, the odds of ending up with the desired sentence are actually quite good, and our computer program can get it done in a matter of minutes. * We can see real-world examples of this idea. Dawkins walks through the step-by-step process that evolved the eye, from a tiny spot that just happens to be sensitive to light, to that spot becoming a small indentation, all the way up to the full eye. There are entire books that walk through every stage of this evolution and show real, living creatures that have eyes at all of these stages. It turns out that ""half an eye"" really is better than ""no eye,"" in the sense that even a little bit of vision is better than none at all! * One remarkable insight pops up towards the end of the book: the only reason we are OK with ""speciesism""—that is, treating some species over others, such as believing in ""human rights,"" but not the rights of other animals—is that the vast majority of ""intermediate"" species in evolution just happen to have died off. If all of them were still around, and we could see all the tiny increments from us to our primate ancestors and other mammals, we'd realize that there is no clear point where ""human"" begins and ""primate"" ends. If we could see all the species in between, we'd realize that the definition of which animals are ""human""—and which ones deserve special rights—is not at all clear cut. I suspect the same will happen if we ever develop general AI. There may be countless small increments from simple, unthinking, mechanical computer algorithms to self-aware, sentient AI, and there probably won't be a single, clear point where we can declare the AI as ""alive"" and start pondering what rights it has.After the initial discussion of how evolution works, the last few chapters seem to be Dawkins responding to various critics, alternate theories, taking a tangent to discuss taxonomy, and so on. These parts feel like we're being pulled into Dawkins' personal arguments and pet peeves, so they are a bit less interesting. But overall, it's a wonderful book, and well worth reading to understand how life came to be."
524,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4972722-terry-grigg,2,"Dawkins’comes up with some good ideas, concepts and examples of explaining evolution, like the development of the eye and bat sonar, and to his credit mentions speciesism and the arms race in nature. I like this line ‘Evolution continually became stuck up sterile blind alleys. Degeneration seemed to be the commonest outcome of even the most carefully guided evolution.’ Idiocracy for sure. He goes on about the sieve principle of selection, how things are arranged in nature as they are, the product of physical forces and reactions. And evolution having no long-term goal, and never starting from a clean drawing board. On the life cycle of the cicada and the way it combats predators. The thylacine ... ‘Maybe they were pests to humans, but humans were much bigger pests to them; now there are no thylacines left and a considerable surplus of humans.’However, Dawkins is not a very good story teller and presents science in a very verbose and convoluted manner. e.g. the way he goes on about the tail length of birds as a means of sexual selection. And considering it an honour to be fossilised. Does he want immortality? He comes up with irritating made up words like ‘existenceworthiness’, and a chapter entitled ‘Puncturing Punctuationism’, and Saltationist and transformed cladists. I think he enjoys being pedantic, and like evolution, his narrative ends up in a cul-de-sac. There is the basic contradiction of ‘intelligent design’ and the ‘blind watchmaker’. He concludes that the Blind Watchmaker programme was endowed with richness, versatility, luxuriance and beauty. It all boils down to whether you think the ‘blind watchmaker’ has done a good job, or should have that damn watch rammed up where the sun don’t shine. This is like comparing his ‘lucky ones’ quote from ‘Unweaving the Rainbow’, and the universe having ‘no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference’ from ‘River Out of Eden’. I prefer the latter. But he should really stick to the day job."
525,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61602483-dietrich,3,"In his preface to The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins says that “We are entirely accustomed to the idea that complex elegance is an indicator of premeditated, crafted design. This is probably the most powerful reason for the belief, held by the vast majority of people that have ever lived, in some kind of supernatural deity. It took a very large leap of the imagination for Darwin and Wallace to see that, contrary to all intuition, there is another way and, once you have understood it, a far more plausible way, for complex ‘design’ to arise of out primeval simplicity. A leap of the imagination so large that, to this day, many people seem still unwilling to make it. It is the main purpose of this book to help the reader to make this leap.” (p. xvi) This quote suggests that Dawkins has a cultural agenda entangled with a scientific one, and TBW follows through on this suggestion. Historically, of course, darwinism dealt a knock-out blow to Paley’s version of natural theology by providing an explanation for adaptive complexity without recourse to a Creator, who now appeared superfluous to the task at hand. Much of Dawkins’s text is devoted to arguing how slow, gradual, cumulative natural selection can explain “prodigies of apparent miracle.” Interestingly enough, Dawkins acknowledges that developments in the second half of the 20th century (findings in molecular biology and the resulting increased difficulty of providing a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life in light of these findings) have led some thinkers to argue that perhaps Paley’s Creator/Watchmaker was no longer superfluous. Dawkins counters that relying on a Creator to explain the origin of life will not do, since it simply assumes the preexistence of complexity, the origins of which need to be explained. Nor can one take the “lazy way out” here by positing the eternity of God. Dawkins retorts that one “might as well just say ‘DNA was always there’, or ‘Life was always there’, and be done with it.” (p.141) In other words, Dawkins does not merely say that darwinism is a better, because less superfluous, explanation than intelligent design for explaining biological complexity, but that intelligent design is intrinsically a non-explanation. This notion that ID is an explanatory non-starter is unobjectionable to all who share the scientific commitment to methodological naturalism. However, Dawkins makes arguments that go beyond the framework of methodological naturalism to promote an aggressive philosophical naturalism, though he does not distinguish the two. For instance, he provides an argument of sorts against the existence of God at the end of the book, one rooted in his scientific quest to understand the development of complexity: “It would be untamed chance if once there was no eye, and then, suddenly, in the twinkling of a generation, an eye appeared, fully fashioned, perfect and whole. This is possible, but the odds against it will keep us busy writing noughts till the end of time. The same applies to the odds against the spontaneous existence of any fully fashioned, perfect and whole beings, including-I see no way of avoiding the conclusion-deities.” (p.317) Of course, this argument is rather strange, since it does not take into account the possibility of an eternal God. Based on the aforementioned p. 141 quote, and despite his willingness to tackle the question of the existence of God, apparently Dawkins thinks the notion that God is eternal is only worth mentioning when it is part of a scientifically illegitimate approach the topic of biological complexity.Methodological naturalism not only legitimates but also delimits science’s proper sphere of authority, giving space for other forms of intellectual inquiry. Dawkins’s general intellectual approach can be seen as a form of scientism, which jettisons the notion that science has any limits. When the famous atheist Antony Flew changed his mind and became a deist based in large part upon the origin of life issue as it it appears in the aftermath of Watson & Crick, he made a point of framing his argument as philosophic rather than scientific in nature. Similarly, Francis Collins, a leading theistic evolutionist, is quite clear that this intellectual worldview does not constitute a scientific theory. Collins, who strongly opposes the notion that ID should be considered science, wrote a highly positive review of Flew’s book Why There Is A God. Although Collins’s outlook on the origin of life differs from Flew’s, and though the two men have very different conceptions of the Deity, they share a commitment to methodological naturalism in science and the pursuit of truth beyond science. Both former atheists profoundly altered their entire worldview based on this pursuit. Dawkins’s especially aggressive scientism leaves no room for such intellectual quests, nor for the answers that Collins and Flew found on their journeys. In TBW, Dawkins views theistic evolution (which he calls guided evolution) as illegitimate. His case against the theistic evolutionists is that they smuggle God into their account of evolution at some point. And Collins’s explicit distancing of theistic evolution from scientific theory matters not one bit to Dawkins or his followers. In Dawkins’s scientistic account, darwinian evolution and theism are irreconcilable, and Darwin wins the contest. And though I have not read The God Delusion, it seems obvious that in this later book the hostility to religion intensifies, as Dawkins utilizes an evolutionary approach to understanding religion that treats/disparages it as a parasitic meme. As for Antony Flew, Dawkins’s response to his turn to deism was to speak of his senility and possible exploitation by others. I find Dawkins’s aggressive scientism un-compelling, off-putting, and even a bit alarming. Though attacks on evolutionary theory are often dismissed as the reaction of hayseeds who are not yet reconciled to science, Francis Collins makes a fruitful suggestion to the effect that the Intelligent Design “movement” can be considered a reaction to the new atheism/aggressive scientism of thinkers like Dawkins. If scientism proceeds as if there is nothing outside of science’s authoritative judgement, and if a scientistic approach to evolution is being used to wage open war against theism, it is perhaps inevitable that this would provoke a pushback attempt to seek God in science. Collins’s opinion regarding the importance of new atheism for the intelligent design movement might be questioned by asking whether Dawkins is really that influential. I would readily concede that the aggressively anti-religious aspect of his writings is not representative of the work of the vast majority of evolutionary biologists. However, unlike most scientists, he is an amazingly popular author and an undeniable public intellectual, and he has plenty of open disciples and collaborators. In addition, his outlook seems to have much institutional support. Dawkins was the University of Oxford’s Professor for the Public Understanding of Science from 1995 to 2008. If this doesn’t mark Dawkins as an establishment figure, I don’t know what would. If Collins’s opinion regarding the new atheism’s relationship to ID has some validity, then it would seem to follow that the most effective way for those who view the ID movement with dismay to take the wind out of its sails would be to crusade against the aggressive scientism represented by Dawkins as much as they do against the books produced by the Discovery Institute.Dawkins’s aggressive, anti-theistic approach to the topic of evolution can be distinguished from the evolutionary theory he champions. The fact that Dawkins dubiously wields the issue of design as a club against theism says nothing regarding the truth or falsity of neo-darwinism. Personally, though I believe in evolution understood as common descent with modification, I am open to the idea that perhaps neo-darwinian mechanisms are less important for understanding evolution than mainstream evolutionary biology takes them to be. My general sense is that Jerry Fodor is probably right when he says that Darwin did for natural history what Marx did for history generally by placing it under control of a “theory,” and that such 19c optimism in the power of science was misplaced, since “history, whether natural or otherwise, is par excellence the locus of explanations that do not conform to the Newtonian paradigm.” (An aside on Fodor: It should go without saying that although Fodor thinks it wrong to conceive of random mutation/natural selection-or any other set of mechanisms- as the engine that drives evolution, he does think there are obviously plenty of persuasive adaptationist accounts for particular episodes in natural history.) If Fodor is correct, then darwinism itself represents a form of scientism, though certainly in a milder, less culturally imperialistic form than Dawkins’s anti-theistic version. However, if it is assumed that evolutionary science can conquer natural history by placing it under control of a theory, it is not much of a leap to assume that evolutionary science can conquer anything else it has a mind to.Regardless of whether or not neo-darwinism represents a form of scientism, and irrespective of the theory’s scientific merits, reading Dawkins helped me to better appreciate ways in which neo-darwinism proves resistant to criticism. On pg. 91 of The Blind Watchmaker, Dawkins says that “One Hundred and twenty years on, we know a lot more about animals and plants than Darwin did, and still not a single case is known to me of a complex organ that could not have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications.” This sounds like quite impressive support for Darwin’s theory. Yet near the very end of the book, Dawkins baldly states that “No matter how improbable it is that an X could have arisen from a Y in a single step, it is always possible to conceive of a series of infinitesimally graded intermediates between them.” (p.317) The first quote doesn’t seem so impressive in light of the second. Surely, no theory is self-validating. However, with neo-darwinism, certain evidentiary concerns do tend to be shrugged off as if to say “it is always possible to conceive.” For instance, given the mind bogglingly large time frames Dawkins emphasizes that evolution relies on, it is plausible to say to the critics that it is unrealistic to expect that we’ll ever be able to model in much detail how certain complex structures likely emerged. Relatedly, the fossil record that one could argue leaves much to be desired from a neo-darwinian point of view is necessarily an incomplete window into the past. So, for someone who already assumes that darwinism is sound, the lack of specificity regarding pathways to complexity and the problematic fossil record need not disturb assumptions, because there are built-in responses for dealing with them. This is an effective practical way to blunt criticism. Furthermore, anyone somewhat skeptical of mainstream evolutionary thinking who rules out intelligent design as science really has no generally effective retort to Dawkins’s proclamation in TBW that “The theory of evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only theory we know of that is in principle capable of explaining the existence of organized complexity.” (pg. 317) Now, precisely because I tend to agree with Fodor that the notion of any one overarching theory of evolution is misguided, I think that the development of other credible theories is a necessary requirement for breaking the spell of darwinian hegemony. Self organization theory seems to me to hold some promise for explaining the existence of organized complexity, and Dawkins did not deal with self organization theory as a potential rival in his book, probably because Stuart Kauffman had yet to write his self-organization texts by 1986. Even so, as is commonly said, self-organization is as of yet more slogan than reality. One might try replying to Dawkins that just because the critics of neo-darwinism have no satisfying alternate explanation, that doesn’t mean that the establishment theory is sound. However, this approach is not likely to change many minds. Also, since the only Darwin doubters who do claim to have a satisfying explanation for organized complexity are creationists of some sort, simply to question mainstream evolutionary thinking is to invite hostility on the assumption that such questioning ultimately aids the creationists. (Fodor’s personal example is instructive here.) One sees this dynamic at work in TBW. Dawkins very sincerely views dissenters from neo-darwinism with suspicion and/or wariness, because he thinks they are motivated by, or at least will be exploited by, a scientifically discredited but still troublesomely influential creationist point of view. I am obviously no fan of Dawkins, but I’m glad I read TBW. Dawkins is a good writer, and has an almost evangelical enthusiasm for his topic. These qualities made it fairly easy to get through the book: it was not an unenjoyable read. In addition, Dawkins’s book-though more that 30 years old-was scientifically informative in certain respects for this lay reader. Also, since Dawkins really has achieved the status of a public intellectual, reading this book gives one insight into how many people think about evolution and its cultural implications. Relatedly, Dawkins’s aggressive anti-theistic scientism raises a whole host of issues and questions worth thinking about. Finally, reading Dawkins helped me better appreciate that whatever valid criticisms one can make regarding mainstream evolutionary theory, those hoping for or even anticipating some sort of major paradigm shift should probably not hold their breath."
526,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2520231-sophie,4,"I was worried that this would be a difficult read because the last time I felt confident about my knowledge of the natural sciences was in like the 10th grade, but it was a really, really good read. Dawkins is much more interesting and enjoyable when he writes about his field of expertise than when he writes about religion. I mean, I'm an atheist and I think what he argues for in The God Delusion is pretty much on the mark, but in hindsight the difference between that book and this one is massive. His arguments in The God Delusion are often quite poor and simplistic (see: 'Here are three ways in which religion has unique, specific harms: *proceeds to list three things which are in no way unique to religion*' and the debater in me groans.) I think people are usually at their best when they get to talk about things they are passionate about (and not in a bitter way.) His enthusiasm for the wonders of nature really comes through, and you can tell he put a lot of thought into how best to discuss various concepts in lay terms. I was baffled by the computer program biomorphs at the beginning and was afraid that whatever noodling you could get down to on a mid-80s Mac would be hopelessly irrelevant today, but they turned out to be an excellent source for metaphors to understand natural selection, a thread wound cleverly throughout the book. I also liked the fact that he discussed some rival theories to neo-Darwinism in later chapters, both current and historical, but wasted no more than a few words on creationism, which is about as much as it deserves. (He did highlight the way creationists try to publicly hijack any *seemingly* anti-Darwinian ideas brough up in the scientific community, which is important.)Overall a very accessible and compelling book, will probs come back to it every now and then. (The bits about bats are amazing. Bats are amazing.)"
527,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Evolution is not for everyone. In a way, it is also faith and Dawkins is an ardent preacher. He makes excellent arguments on how evolution works on well-hidden axioms. Some of the concepts described in the book are astounding - like the concepts of cumulative selection or the vastness of time. The lucidity with which the basic message is hammered repeatedly, along with diversity of examples and interspersing of tales from other fields make the book a truly magnificent read. Even the ardent evolution non-believers are likely to walk away with many questions if they read the book dispassionately. Yet, the book suffers from two faults: most of the book appears like an attack on the arguments of god- or religion-believers rather than a good science by itself. Texts describing any good theories should spend most of the time elaborating itself rather than creating supposed critiques' strawmen and shooting them down. The book also tends to attack the most average religious arguments rather than those more evolved.The bigger problem is the book's inability to recognize the axioms that lie at the heart of evolution theory. Whether Euclidean or Big Bang, every theory starts perforce starts with hypotheses that can not be proven. If there is any god, a believer can argue, he is the one setting those axioms. The rest may simply build on itself, in the most fanatic case with a minor bit of divine intervention here and there. While the presence or absence of axioms of a certain kind can never prove or disprove any creator, a good rationalist like Dawkins should have spelled the axioms of the evolutionary theory better.All that said, this is a great book for anyone who is not a specialist in the field."
528,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82803739-antonio,4,"Having read 'The Selfish Gene' prior to 'The Blind Watchmaker', I already knew Dawkins' writing style, and I (roughly) knew what to expect from this book.I found Dawkin's explanation of Darwinism clear and accessible, its keypoints recurrently repeated over the entire book so there would be no mistake the reader (even the one not trained in biology) could put off the book and walk away with a wrong idea about evolution and natural selection. I thoroughly enjoyed the chapters about echolocation and about the idea of life originating from 'clay-crystals replicators' (which I never encountered before although I am trained in biology, and which put my imagination under consistent stress), as well as the one about the arms races, BUT (yes, there is a but) I was not expecting to find myself tangled in the countless arguments Dawkins uses to prove his point against other theories proposed to explain evolution, which were at times tedious and boring. Neverthless, I think Dawkins felt compelled to tackle the subject as comprehensively as possible and I am sure that the book would have been diminished if he decided to omit at least some of those arguments, reason why I feel I can forgive him (not completely, though) for the hard time he gave me when going past certain chapters, especially the last two.Overall, I think 'The Blind Watchmaker' can be an interesting and illuminating read for anyone eager to understand the real workings of evolution and selection, with the warning that the reader may sometimes need to equip himself with a good pair of 'mental running shoes' (as Dawkins says in the books) and a good deal of patience to get through some parts which may feel unnecessary and boring."
529,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41603992-abraham,5,"The undeniably amazing complexity of living organisms has been taken as incontrovertible evidence for the existence of a divine being who intelligently designed every life form here on earth (along with the whole rest of the universe). In 'The Blind Watchmaker', Richard Dawkins argues that this complexity is actually the result of the cumulative selection, over millions of years, of genes which conferred survival and reproductive benefits on their phenotypes.Such benefits could have been absolutely tiny - imagine the eyes of two creatures, one pair of which focused milliseconds quicker than the other, allowing their possessor to start fleeing a predator fractionally quicker and thereby living to reproduce another day. Nonetheless, over time they add up to create the complex organisms that currently populate our planet.After making this main point, Dawkins discusses various nuances - for example, is the rate of adaptation steady over time, or does it happen in fits and starts, and in keeping with environmental changes? After this, he debunks some interesting alternative theories, not limited to creationism. Lamarckism stood out for me - the idea that physical characteristics you acquire during your life (for example, the large muscles of a body-builder) can be passed on to your offspring - this theory was popular not for its (non-existent) scientific credibility but because it tied in neatly with certain political ethoses of the day - for example, communism with its heroic muscular workers etc etc. That factor is probably a whole subject in itself - reading recommendations welcome! "
530,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7188699-abhaga,3,"After fussing over for the longest time about which Richard Dawkins book to read, I picked this one up. Turns out, not a great choice.The book is informative and also gives you a good idea of basic evolution process in first 3-4 chapters. But there are two major problems. One is that many of the later chapters are written as responses to specific challenges and questions posed by opponents or different groups within evolutionists. The responses are well crafted and satisfactory but you have no idea if those are the major questions or difficulties faced by the theory of evolution - things that it struggles to explain. This is not a fault of the book but for this reason, I will not recommend this as the first book to read about Evolution.Second problem is with the repetitive, rambling writing style of Dawkins. He repeats the same thing so many times that it starts getting on your nerves. I even took to cursory reading in some places after a while. I understand that he is writing as an apologist but to a convert looking for deeper understanding, it sounds like preaching to the choir.But those two niggles aside, he destroys critics and objections pretty thoroughly, sticking in multiple pins even when the first one would have done the job. In that sense, he allows you to develop a deeper and well rounded understanding of Evolutionary worldview. I am looking forward to reading his other books as well, hoping he has done a better job of writing those."
531,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19027675-keith,2,"I just found a copy of The Blind Watchmaker, Why the evidence for evolution reveals a universe without design, at a library sale and began reading it. Besides being 30 years out of date (which may or may not be relevant), it is annoyingly written. Dawkins wrote in a drunken sailor’s walk way (with frequent parentheticals (of which more later)) with frequent (and often interrupted) digressions. Those last sentences are positively cogent by his standards, but illustrative of the scattered style. I found myself skipping paragraphs as soon as I had sussed their gist rather than slogging through them endlessly. No matter what the blurbs say, The Blind Watchmaker was not easy reading because it so undirected. Really, you can talk about an “arms race” without devoting so much ink to suggesting that your analogy could be about the USA and USSR, but doesn’t necessarily have to have named participants nor do they need to have those exact ideologies. Unfortunately, Richard Dawkins couldn’t in this book. Perhaps he needed to give more credit to the reader’s intelligence.Much of the book is spent on Dawkins’ disagreements with other evolutionists, such as Eldridge and Gould (punctuated equilibrium), Dover (molecular drive) and schools of taxonomy. The made up dialog between his impression of a real-life and an extreme caricature Darwinists failed to entertain or enlighten.I would have given The Blind Watchmaker a higher rating had I not been worn down by Dawkins’ style and disorganization."
532,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11507273-hasan,5,"Richard Dawkins wrote this book in order to show how the complexity of life on earth could have arisen by the apparently blind and ""random"" forces of nature. The catch of course being that evolution by natural selection is anything but random since organisms that are better suited to survive and reproduce tend to saturate the environment with copies of themselves and while the specific advantages that some individuals might enjoy over their peers might come from random mutations, natural selection decidedly is not random. On the way we meet a number of theories that have been posited as alternatives to Neo-Darwinism and we find ourselves dealing with the explanatory power of these rival theories and in some cases, the astronomical odds against some part of these theories being true. This book might not be the best for someone who believes that evolution by natural selection is true especially if one is familiar with the basic arguments that might be presented in favour of the theory. And while I would consider myself in this group, I certainly learned a great deal from this book. Perhaps my idea of skeptically examining every argument put forth by Dawkins did pay off. I am thinking of reading Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea next. I tried reading it before but perhaps I will find it more illuminating this time around. It might be a good place for other readers of this book to continue their investigation into this topic too. "
533,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,4,"I could have never imagined that reading about biology and evolution can be such a delight. The subject is presented in a structured and simple enough (to an extent possible) way, topped with the poetic style of Dawkins. I cannot help admiring Dawkins more and more for promoting reason and evidence above everything else when it comes to matters of science. The book is essentially an answer to a very common argument against the theory of evolution, which goes like this ""How could have an organ so complex as a heart/eye/brain/wings/etc.. have evolved by random mutation and natural selection? Unless all the composite parts of that organ were all at the same time present, this organ would have been useless for the animal"". I myself used to wonder about this a lot, which is one of the reasons in picked up the book. It was very fulfilling to find the clear answers supported by evidence to most of my questions. There are no attempts to trick, confuse, appeal to your on beliefs...just plain evidence, fact, knowledge. The reason I am giving this book 4 stars is because, for me, the subject of speciation was not adequately addressed. This particular gap for me will have to be filled by another book apparently. "
534,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/520483-serene,4,"Dawkins has a down-to-earth, humorous at times, way of explaining difficult concepts in a simple manner. His presentation of evolution as traveling through a ""space"" of animals, his discussion of Cairns-Smith's theory of the origin of life, and his explanation of the variable rates that evolution might proceed at were all fascinating. I understood evolution much better after reading this, particularly on the genetic level (which my high-school education treated only lightly.)Except for the occasional pot-shot, he stays out of discussing religion at all, which is just as well, because I don't think he quite gets it. For example, he says that God is not an acceptable explanation of the complexity of the universe because He would already have to be more complex than what he created. But the faithful don't claim to have a 100% comprehensive delineation of all of existence any more that Darwinism can claim to be completely comprehensive. Apparently he has a hard time accepting that there may be some things we may never know."
535,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2242165-tyler,2,"I'm a little disappointed here. This was my introduction to Richard Dawkins, and maybe I just picked the wrong book. I was hoping to learn more about the fascinating world of evolutionary biology, but instead got a long-winded, all-over-the-map apologetic response to Creationism and various oddities like Lamarckism and Punctuationism.This really is an odd book, with the first hundred pages or so mostly devoted to Dawkins's own little computer programming exercise to demonstrate how cumulative selection works. It was still fun reading in parts, especially when he talks about specific animal traits such as echolocation in bats, or the development of the eye in different organisms. I may come back to Dawkins again, maybe The Ancestor's Tale or The Selfish Gene or something. I suppose this book serves its purpose in defending Darwinism against those who feel threatened by it, but if you're well past that already you can probably pass on this book as well."

I don't disagree with anything Dawkins is claiming, so don't take this poor rating as meaning his book is full of errors or that I dislike him/his claims. It just did a very, consistently good job of putting me to sleep. There was a small section of the book (a chapter or two) that I would give five stars to that discussed the origins of self-replication and mutation in non-living substances like clay. It was extremely thought-provoking and (ABSOLUTELY KEY) wasn't something I was already familiar with. The chapter on positive feedback, which focused on non-useful traits that could only be related to sexual attraction, was also reasonably interesting, if a bit drawn out. But most of it was extremely dry.My guess is that this book was fresh information when it was published in 1986, but even as someone with very little formal education in biology, in 2014, 90% of it just wasn't worth my time.

Evolution is awesome! We have a lot to learn from it."" That said, the last 2-3 chapters felt like a bit of a drag and were a little hard to understand; maybe they'll make more sense on the 2nd reading.

This is definitely not light reading, but for anyone doubtful of the truth of Darwinism and evolution by natural selection, or for believers who just want to know more, this is great.It's basically an argument for how evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only rational argument out there that can explain how the first replicating cells gave rise to organised complexity in the form of living things, in all our diversity, which all have structures and/or organs well-suited to that organism's particular environment and that therefore improve the probability of survival and reproduction of the responsible genes.Intelligent design seems like a reasonable explanation if you don't have the scientific knowledge to provide alternative reasoning. With the relevant scientific knowledge, as we are privileged to now have, natural selection makes sense. And it is awesome, literally."

A good reread, because now I wasn't annoyed by the examples. Quite interesting, it is really written from the point of view that Darwin's evolution theory is the only one that can be true. Also funny to read that he is really expecting wonderful things from moleculair research. 30 Years later a lot has happenend in this world, so it is good to remind that Darwin theory is still standing.

Next on my list is ""The extended phenotype"" and I hope that, by reading more and more books about this topic (and preferably written by Dawkins), I will conclude that the new books are only a little bit less challenging than the previous book of Richard Dawkins.

542,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14697853-james,3,Natural selection is very logical and it is a good start but it is still a theory since the time scales are unobservable on a human level it's very difficult to prove.

""The Blind Watchmaker"" was first published in the UK in 1986. It explains the theory of evolution in detail from a theoretical perspective. The term ""clock and watch"" in the title of this book is a metaphor for living things, emphasizing that the structure and function of living things are complicated and ingenious. The ""Watchmaker"" in the title is borrowed from the famous monograph ""Natural Theology"" by William Paley, the 18th century theologian. Richard Dawkins was born in Nairobi, Kenya in 1941. He received a Bachelor of Zoology, Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Science from Oxford University. He is one of the most famous and outspoken atheists and evolutionists still alive today. He has the title masterpieces of ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" (Darwin's Rottweiler): ""The Selfish Gene"", ""Blind Watchmaker"" "", ""Evidence of Evolution"", ""Ancestor's Story"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Impossible2. Good design3. Progressive change4. Animal Space5. Gene file6. What a heaven7. Creative evolution8. Sex selection9. Disease? Gradient?10. Tree of Life Philosophers are thinking about 3 questions: Who am I? Where am i from Where am i going? In fact, biologists are studying these three issues. Even today, biologists cannot tell us clearly how every part of the human body works? How did humans and other creatures be born and become what they are today? Where is the end of biological evolution? I have read a series of books called ""Earth Chronicles"". This series of books has been published since 1976. The author Xiqin's explanation of the origin of mankind is the result of intelligent biological intervention. But until today, in fact, for a long period of time in the future, I have no way to firmly believe in any view of this ""natural evolution"" or ""creation theory"" . I sometimes think like this: If human beings were created by other intelligent creatures, where did those intelligent creatures come from? Even if they were created, this cycle should have an end, and the creator at the end should be more intelligent than human beings. If the creator at the end was born in heaven and earth (is it equivalent to evolution?), then since more intelligent creatures can evolve naturally, it is entirely possible for humans to evolve naturally. Specifically, whether you believe that human beings were created by God, female snails, extraterrestrial intelligent creatures, or any intelligent life, then the question that follows is, who created these creators? It is undoubtedly hard to convince people to make a conclusion that ""the creator naturally arises from the universe, or the creator is the starting point of the universe"" assertively. Because creators are more advanced than human beings, the possibility of them naturally occurring should be smaller. Even today, physics tells us that the universe originated in the Big Bang, so we will also have this question, what was before the Big Bang? What caused the Big Bang? The term ""watchmaker"" comes from the 18th century theologian Perry's ""Natural Theology"". Perry said that if you find a stone in a deserted area, you can easily accept the idea of ""it's always here""; but when you find a watch in a deserted area, You almost never think ""it's always here"". So, since the watch can not occur spontaneously in nature, that it far more complex human and other biological clocks, not to appear spontaneously in nature. Therefore, there must be a role such as a ""watchmaker"", who created humans and other lives. Dawkins believes that this ""watchmaker"" is the physical law of nature itself, and this law governs the completion of evolution. The laws of physics have no purpose, so they are ""blind"" or ""blind."" Each of us has a tendency to experience miracles when faced with highly complex machines. Try to recall the first time you heard that AlphaGo defeated the strongest Go player in humans, or the Atlas humanoid robot learned the feeling of backflip. This makes us instinctively unacceptable to the concept of evolution. It is difficult for us to imagine how the laws of physics without autonomous consciousness can lead to orderly results. However, Darwinists tell us that the process of evolution took billions of years to complete, and each of us cannot really understand what such a long time means, and this has created another great difficulty for our understanding. It is precisely because of the huge differences in time measurement scales that many hypotheses in modern biology and geography were ridiculed by almost everyone when they were first proposed. If we look at the concept of evolution in a broader sense, can the 300-year period since humans entered an industrial society count as evolution? Although our genes have hardly changed, the changes in human society from organizational structure to production capacity may be far more than 30,000 years. If such a cliff-like evolution can be completed in 300 years, what does 300 million years mean for the evolution of organisms? From inorganic matter to the creation of intelligent creatures that can send spacecraft into outer space, is 300 million years enough? Those of us who have received nine years of compulsory education know that genes are the basis of the inheritance of every organism. In the genetic process of genes, non-directional mutations may occur randomly, but natural selection has a direction. Evolution seems to be accomplished through such infinitely many cumulative choices. The long period of time makes the gradual accumulation of choices almost infinitely many times, each time the change is so small that you can almost think that the difference is infinitely small. Here we need to have a certain understanding of the concept of limit, which once again caused a barrier to understanding. The author is not only a biologist, but also has some experience in programming. He described in detail the results shown by an evolutionary program he wrote. The results show that as long as you determine some basic rules, set the possibility of random mutations in the system, and finally add a certain tendency selection (such as artificial selection), the final result may seem to have a certain law, it seems to be It was designed artificially. Because evolution is gradually completed, a natural doubt will follow. Why are these intermediate steps or intermediate states of organisms not eliminated? Many organs or tissues are obviously interdependent. In other words, if they appear alone, they are basically useless ; if they appear at the same time , they can play a huge role. Human organs are so sophisticated, like a huge machine, it will stop working immediately if any link is missing. Before other links that need to be used as assistance have not yet evolved, this incomplete machine is not only unable to perform its functions, but also a huge burden. Why is it not discarded, but retained, as if purposefully waiting for the last one Is the evolution of parts completed? Understanding the three questions at the beginning, whether understood in a philosophical or biological sense, may actually be meaningless for the survival of a single organism. However, the expression of certain DNA in human genes seems to determine that some people will be full of enthusiasm and curiosity about these issues. This curiosity about the unknown engraved in genes, no matter how time passes, will always continue in the human population with the help of certain individuals. "" Once I was invited to a university debate association to debate with creationists. I still remember the shock I felt. After the debate, we had dinner together. My next seat was a young lady who was in the debate. Representing a creationist, the speech is fairly powerful. I don’t think she will be a creationist, so I asked her to answer me honestly why she would speak on behalf of the creationist. She admitted that she was just honing her debate skills. I find it more challenging to defend my unconvinced position. It seems that the University Debate Association does this. The person participating in the debate is designated to defend which side, regardless of their beliefs. Their beliefs have no place in the debate. I'm not good at speaking to the public. I came all the way to attend because I believe the topic I was invited to defend is true. I found that the people of the Debating Association only used the topic of the debate as an introduction to the debate game, so I decided not to accept the invitation of the Debating Association. Issues involving scientific truth should not allow false arguments. "" Before I entered university in high school, I was very interested in the sense of debate. And he did join the debate team in his freshman year. Later, I immediately found out that I needed to defend my objection. Although intellectually I can understand that this is done to make myself more critical thinking. But emotionally it was difficult to accept, so I only participated in one or two debates, then withdrew from the debate team, and never joined the debate association ever since. "" What I want to argue is that no matter where the complex things in the universe appear, the explanation may be roughly the same; it applies to us, chimpanzees, worms, oak trees, and monsters in outer space. On the other hand, for what I call "" ""Simple"" things, such as rocks, clouds, rivers, galaxies and quarks. These are all things in physics. Chimpanzees, dogs, bats, cockroaches, people, insects, dandelions, bacteria and aliens, It's a thing of biology. The difference lies in the complexity of the design. Biology studies complex things, and those things feel like they were designed for a certain purpose. Physics studies simple things, and they don't make us feel ""designed"" at all. At first glance, artificial objects such as computers and cars seem to be exceptions. They are very complex and obviously designed, but they are not alive. They are made of metal and plastic, not flesh and blood. But in this book, I will firmly regard them as biological research objects. "" "" If we find such a clock in the wild, even if we don't know how it appeared, its precise and complex design will force us to conclude: this clock must have a manufacturer; it must be in some time and place. There is a craftsman or a group of craftsmen who, for a certain purpose-we find that the purpose is indeed achieved-made it; the maker knows how to make a clock and designs its use. Perry insists that no one can reasonably refute this conclusion. Even atheists will come to this conclusion when thinking about natural works, because: every sign of ingenuity, every design expression, not only exists in clocks, works of nature There are both; the difference between the two is that natural works show greater ingenuity, more complex designs, beyond the degree of artificial products, it is difficult to count. "" "" The simulation of the telescope and the eye, the simulation of the clock and the living thing, is wrong. The opposite of the appearance is correct. The only watchmaker in nature is the blind force of physics, but those forces condense and operate in a very special way. And the truth The watchmaker had a foresight: in his mind, he had a future purpose. He designed gears and clockwork and planned the connection between them. Darwin discovered a blind, unconscious, and automatic process, all biological Existence and seemingly purposeful constructions, we now know that can be explained by this process, this is natural selection. Natural Selection has no purpose in its heart. Natural Selection has no intention or mind. Natural Selection does not plan for the future. Natural Selection has no vision. There is no foresight, not even vision. If Natural Selection is a watchmaker in nature, it must be a blind watchmaker. "" This evolutionary force is a bit similar to the way computers produce artificial intelligence today . In fact, for the algorithm, it just keeps repeating some operations according to certain rules . It is for its lack of understanding of what does and does not know these things will lead where it leads. "" We want to find a precise way to define ""complex"". Some things we think are complicated, how can we be more precise? We want to find out what people, moles, earthworms, airplanes, clocks and watches have in common, and what they have in common with milk jelly , Mount Brown, and the moon. The answer we got is: complex things have certain properties, which are prescribed in advance, and it is extremely unlikely that they can be created simply randomly. As far as living things are concerned, the prescribed properties are In this sense, it means ""smart""; or it is the mastery of a specific ability such as flying, if judged by an aeronautical engineer; or the mastery of a relatively general ability, such as avoiding death or spreading by reproduction Gene. "" "" Non-living things don’t do this work, except for artificial machines-we have agreed to treat them as honorable creatures. Non-living things accept the forces that balance them with the environment at their mercy. Mount Brown has been around for a long time, I Knowing that it may continue to exist for a while, but it will not try to live. If the rock lies somewhere under the influence of gravity, it will lie there. It can continue to lie there without having to do anything. Brown The peak exists now and will continue to exist until the wind and rain abraded it, or it collapsed by an earthquake. It will not take measures to repair the erosion, cracks, or recover after the earthquake collapses. The biological body will be. Non-biological bodies just obey physics. The general law of learning. "" "" I care about is: whether we put what I call the"" complex ""nature of what is called, it is an important nature, require time-consuming it is to explain biological matter. Characteristic body and biological objects with physical objects Differentiate. The explanation we put forward must not contradict the laws of physics. Our explanation will use the laws of physics, and only the laws of physics. But the way we use the laws of physics is very special, and it is generally not discussed in physics textbooks. That special way is Darwin's way. "" In fact, the interpretation method used by the author can be understood as the "" Pyramid Principle "" . In order to support his final argument , he needs some arguments. These arguments are at the higher levels of the pyramid . For example , explain the functions of the human body at the organ level . If the reader thinks that this level is still not direct enough, then he will use each argument in this level as an argument and continue to dig out the arguments needed for each argument. This is the second level of argument, which is one level lower on the pyramid . "

549,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17108975-odi-shonga,4,"Contrary to the implication of the subtitle, this book isn't just an attack on creationism. In fact, it's a sweeping defence of Darwinian natural selection against various opponents, with creationism probably taken the least seriously (but addressed all the same).Once more, Dawkins manages to treat you as a sophistacted reader, while somehow never falling prey to the curse of knowledge (where experts are bad at explaining because they fail to gauge the right level of background knowledge or interest their reader has). Dawkins proves himself to be a supreme writer once again, never failing to convey the difficult in a graspable and uncondescending way.The crux of the book is that evolution by natural selection is the only way to explain the organised complexity of life. This is because the chance of organised, living complexity arising in one leap is propesterously unlikely, so it would have to be gradual. Then, of the gradual ways complex life could arise, all rival theories fall flat. Some theories that are dispensed with include: the blue-print theory of trait inheritence, where traits that are well-used get passed down, as though saved onto a genetic blue-print; the mutation-first theory of evolution, where random mutations guide evolutionary improvement, not natural pressures or a combination of both; and others that, if I had a better memory, I'd be able to list here for you, but I don't, so you get a shitty half-baked summary instead -- sorry. Anyway, if you don't really buy mythology, but you want a creation story that's backed by reason and evidence, you want to read this and The Selfish Gene. It does occur to me that Dawkins is basically an evangelist for Darwinism, and I am basically a convert. But hey, we all have to believe in something, don't we? Rather this sprawling web of intricate connections and relatedness -- a world of variegated beings united -- than an odd mythology that encourages obedience, fear, and chauvinism, and that probably isn't true."

I haven't studied Biology for over 30 years and I gave up because they kept trying to make me draw an eye. I was terrible at drawing eyes. So I got as much of this as my brain was able to process and there was a ton of goodness, but I could have done with more anecdotes and slightly less God-bashing. I get that God-bashing is Dawkins' superpower, but his arguments for natural selection stand on their own without them having to be a refutation."
551,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8507732-avishek-khan,5,"Just when I thought I'd had enough of this topic of evolutionary biology and should start reading the ""important"" stuff that would be effective for my career, and thus, buy me money, the idea occurred to me - why not give this book a last try before diving into the shitpile of serious things? ""After all, you've been thinking about reading the book for the last 10 years, Avishek. Why not now? Just get it over with and then do what-fucking-ever you wanted to do,"" I told myself. And then I realized my mistake.It's not reading the book that the mistake was, it's in fact not reading the book for such a long time. Why should I, though? It's a very old book, written 30 years ago which is bound to have backdated facts and incomplete pieces of information whereas I've already read Why Evolution Is True (2009) by Jerry A. Coyne, Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (2008) by my Facebook friend Neil Shubin, Nick Lane's Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution (2009), and Dawkins' recent work The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution (2009). And above all, there's The Selfish Gene, which is like the bible to me, containing (almost) all the answers I need regarding life and other shitty little things. But little did I know that I had so much yet to know. (facepalm)The title of the book could reasonably have been ""The Blind Watchmaker And How She Does Her Job"". Before depicting the image of this watchmaker, an allusion to William Paley's infamous ""Watchmaker"" argument for the so-called ""complex design"" of the living things, Dawkins first went on to define the idea of ""complexity"" and ""design"", since the main thesis of the book is to demonstrate how natural selection alone can give rise to the apparent design of complex life forms. Then he got straight onto explaining what natural selection is and how it works with his mind-boggling ability to use simple and easy to conceive analogies with numerous examples (Paley's favorite one - the human eye - being the first) and his own simplistic computer simulation of evolution. In his signature style, like a great teacher as he always is, Dawkins painstakingly brought up example after example of animal adaptations and explained each and every one of them from an evolutionary perspective in such a way that is guaranteed to plant the idea of natural selection deep inside your brain that you can never get rid of. And once you understand it fully, there's no denying the inevitability of the ""miraculously"" complex design that we see around us today.The first 8 chapters contain the essence of the book. The last three chapters are merely an extension where Dawkins brought up a few alternative hypotheses to Darwinism and decisively destroyed them in style. To me, this is where the book became kind of monotonous and boring. Nevertheless, I guess it was necessary to make it complete.Of all the books on evolution I read, this one ponders into the idea of evolution in the most elaborate manner which will introduce the reader to the Darwinian way of thinking and leave him/her conceptually enlightened. It's a must-read for every science enthusiast out there, especially if you're new to the idea of evolution and looking for good materials to start learning, this should be the first pop-science book to read."
552,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/177596-oceana2602,3,"Oh, this is a difficult review. I feel as if I need to explain my own view about religion before I can properly review this book, but honestly, I don't care much for discussing religion on the internet, in a book review. So, to make it short, I'm an atheist. In fact, (and to quote Douglas Adams, because it's always good to quote Douglas Adams), I'm a radical atheist.Which makes reading this book kinda like preaching to the choir.That's probably the reason why I didn't really enjoy it. That, and the pseudo-scientific approach. The author is so eagerly trying to convince me of his views on evolution, he goes into great detail explaining evolution to me (unfortunately, he assumes that I know nothing about evolution, thus explaining it in tiny little baby steps that leave out the interesting ""real"" science). He says, look, evolution, it works! It's right! This is what happened! BELIEVE ME!And yes, sure, I believe him. No wait, I don't believe him. I know for a fact that what he says, well, not particularly what he says, but I know for a fact that evolution is true.See, where I'm from, nobody doubts that evolution isn't true. nobody would even suggest that ""creation"" is a real, scientific alternative to evolution. In 31 years and with a post-grad degree, I have never met anyone who would have doubted evolution.So the whole purpose of this book is completely baffling to me.It's not enough of a science book to really teach about evolution. And it's not combative enough to actually come right out and say ""there is no creation."" The only thing the author does is show that evolution works - the important step, the step that says ""and not only does it work, but here, let me show you why there is no god involved in it either"", he leaves out.I know I'm so disappointed with this book because that last thing was what I expected. I expected someone to write about why creation doesn't work, not why evolution does. That's not the authors fault.I might give another one of his books a try, but it'll probably have the same effect - we already have the same opinion (or close enough, I guess), for me to find his books interesting, provocative or even thought-provoking. I feel as if the book only deserves two stars (""it was okay""), but I'll add another one for the effort.they may have an entirely different effect on you, though, so I still recommend you read one. And if you do, ""The Blind Watchmaker"" would certainly not be a bad choice."
553,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"A great read that explains evolution, natural selection, darwinism, and why these are not only the theories most strongly supported by the evidence, but also why they are the only theories we have that, in principle, could even begin to explain the existence of life. Dawkins takes a complicated subject—in fact, many subjects, including biology, chemistry, physics, math, probability, programming, geology, and more—and manages to explain them in a clear, approachable way that can be understood by just about any educated person.There are lots of wonderful insights and explanations in the book:* The physical ""shape"" of an object is enough to create order from disorder. For example, consider a natural sieve—that is, any item that just happens to have a small hole in it. Small objects will tend to go through the hole and large objects will not. The result is that items get sorted by size. We get order from disorder, but no designer was involved! Similarly, the ""shape"" of biological devices can create order, and the key idea behind life is that certain molecules can create copies of themselves solely because if their ""shape"" and normal physical/chemical processes. It seems highly orderly, but no designer is necessary to make this order possible.* The book goes through a few possible theories for how life could've started on earth—how these initial self-replicating ""shapes"" could've formed. One interesting idea was that life developed from clay crystals (silicates). These crystals live in river beds and take various shapes based on the flow of the water and the other crystals they touch. Occasionally, the crystals just happen to form a shape that tends to stick together very well and as more clay runs into this shape, it clumps up more and more, and eventually forms a small dam in the river. This causes stagnant pools of water to form near these dams and, during the dry season, these pools dry up. The clay also dries, cracks, and then wind blows this crystalline structure around, like spores. Some of these crystals end up in other rivers, where their shape cause clumping to happen again, creating more of the same ""shapes"", and repeating the entire process with dams, pools, and drying. In other words, the shape of these clay crystals allows them to ""replicate"" themselves. * Of course, clay crystals are inorganic, but perhaps the organic molecules that are the building blocks of modern life were able to somehow build on top of the replication abilities of these inorganic crystals. For example, some organic material that happened to be in the river may have bonded with the clay, changed its shape in some way that happened to increase the odds of the clay replicating, and now not only are clay crystals being replicated from river to river, but the organic molecules also come along for the ride. Eventually, the organic molecules may be all that's necessary. * But how could the order and complexity of modern life arise from such ""random"" events? What are the odds that clay silicates blowing in the wind leads to something as intricate as the human eye? The book has a great discussion on the probability of life, with two key points: the odds of something as complicated as an eye forming are so vanishingly small as to effectively be impossible; but the odds of the basic building blocks of life forming, given that those building blocks are much, much simpler than the eye, are much higher. Those odds may still be low, but not impossibly low, and given that there are billions of planets and billions of years, even fairly unlikely events can happen.* A key second argument around the idea of ""random"" events leading to complex, orderly organisms is that while the events (i.e., mutations) are random, the selection process is not! In particularly, it's not that complexity appeared randomly, in one giant leap, going from a simple replicator to a fully-formed eye, but rather, that what we're seeing is adaptive complexity, where complexity increases step by step, generation after generation. Each change is a tiny increment that happens randomly, and if it happens to increase the chances of replication, it will be passed down to future generations. * Dawkins gives lots of examples to highlight the difference between single-step theories vs multi-step theories. One example is based on the infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters theorem. In fact, Dawkins suggests a simpler version: how long would a single monkey typing randomly at a single typewriter take to come up with just one specific sentence from Shakespeare? If each sentence was written separately and with no relation to previous sentences (""single-step""), the odds are extraordinarily low—even with a very fast monkey (that is, a computer program simulating a monkey), it would take longer than the age of the universe. But now imagine instead the monkey starts with one sentence, and at each step makes a bunch of variations on the sentence, each with random mutations to it. Then, some ""selection pressure"" (e.g., a computer) selects the sentence that, in some way, resembles the chosen Shakespeare sentence the most, and the process repeats. With this ""multi-step"" process, the odds of ending up with the desired sentence are actually quite good, and our computer program can get it done in a matter of minutes. * We can see real-world examples of this idea. Dawkins walks through the step-by-step process that evolved the eye, from a tiny spot that just happens to be sensitive to light, to that spot becoming a small indentation, all the way up to the full eye. There are entire books that walk through every stage of this evolution and show real, living creatures that have eyes at all of these stages. It turns out that ""half an eye"" really is better than ""no eye,"" in the sense that even a little bit of vision is better than none at all! * One remarkable insight pops up towards the end of the book: the only reason we are OK with ""speciesism""—that is, treating some species over others, such as believing in ""human rights,"" but not the rights of other animals—is that the vast majority of ""intermediate"" species in evolution just happen to have died off. If all of them were still around, and we could see all the tiny increments from us to our primate ancestors and other mammals, we'd realize that there is no clear point where ""human"" begins and ""primate"" ends. If we could see all the species in between, we'd realize that the definition of which animals are ""human""—and which ones deserve special rights—is not at all clear cut. I suspect the same will happen if we ever develop general AI. There may be countless small increments from simple, unthinking, mechanical computer algorithms to self-aware, sentient AI, and there probably won't be a single, clear point where we can declare the AI as ""alive"" and start pondering what rights it has.After the initial discussion of how evolution works, the last few chapters seem to be Dawkins responding to various critics, alternate theories, taking a tangent to discuss taxonomy, and so on. These parts feel like we're being pulled into Dawkins' personal arguments and pet peeves, so they are a bit less interesting. But overall, it's a wonderful book, and well worth reading to understand how life came to be."
554,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4972722-terry-grigg,2,"Dawkins’comes up with some good ideas, concepts and examples of explaining evolution, like the development of the eye and bat sonar, and to his credit mentions speciesism and the arms race in nature. I like this line ‘Evolution continually became stuck up sterile blind alleys. Degeneration seemed to be the commonest outcome of even the most carefully guided evolution.’ Idiocracy for sure. He goes on about the sieve principle of selection, how things are arranged in nature as they are, the product of physical forces and reactions. And evolution having no long-term goal, and never starting from a clean drawing board. On the life cycle of the cicada and the way it combats predators. The thylacine ... ‘Maybe they were pests to humans, but humans were much bigger pests to them; now there are no thylacines left and a considerable surplus of humans.’However, Dawkins is not a very good story teller and presents science in a very verbose and convoluted manner. e.g. the way he goes on about the tail length of birds as a means of sexual selection. And considering it an honour to be fossilised. Does he want immortality? He comes up with irritating made up words like ‘existenceworthiness’, and a chapter entitled ‘Puncturing Punctuationism’, and Saltationist and transformed cladists. I think he enjoys being pedantic, and like evolution, his narrative ends up in a cul-de-sac. There is the basic contradiction of ‘intelligent design’ and the ‘blind watchmaker’. He concludes that the Blind Watchmaker programme was endowed with richness, versatility, luxuriance and beauty. It all boils down to whether you think the ‘blind watchmaker’ has done a good job, or should have that damn watch rammed up where the sun don’t shine. This is like comparing his ‘lucky ones’ quote from ‘Unweaving the Rainbow’, and the universe having ‘no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference’ from ‘River Out of Eden’. I prefer the latter. But he should really stick to the day job."
555,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61602483-dietrich,3,"In his preface to The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins says that “We are entirely accustomed to the idea that complex elegance is an indicator of premeditated, crafted design. This is probably the most powerful reason for the belief, held by the vast majority of people that have ever lived, in some kind of supernatural deity. It took a very large leap of the imagination for Darwin and Wallace to see that, contrary to all intuition, there is another way and, once you have understood it, a far more plausible way, for complex ‘design’ to arise of out primeval simplicity. A leap of the imagination so large that, to this day, many people seem still unwilling to make it. It is the main purpose of this book to help the reader to make this leap.” (p. xvi) This quote suggests that Dawkins has a cultural agenda entangled with a scientific one, and TBW follows through on this suggestion. Historically, of course, darwinism dealt a knock-out blow to Paley’s version of natural theology by providing an explanation for adaptive complexity without recourse to a Creator, who now appeared superfluous to the task at hand. Much of Dawkins’s text is devoted to arguing how slow, gradual, cumulative natural selection can explain “prodigies of apparent miracle.” Interestingly enough, Dawkins acknowledges that developments in the second half of the 20th century (findings in molecular biology and the resulting increased difficulty of providing a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life in light of these findings) have led some thinkers to argue that perhaps Paley’s Creator/Watchmaker was no longer superfluous. Dawkins counters that relying on a Creator to explain the origin of life will not do, since it simply assumes the preexistence of complexity, the origins of which need to be explained. Nor can one take the “lazy way out” here by positing the eternity of God. Dawkins retorts that one “might as well just say ‘DNA was always there’, or ‘Life was always there’, and be done with it.” (p.141) In other words, Dawkins does not merely say that darwinism is a better, because less superfluous, explanation than intelligent design for explaining biological complexity, but that intelligent design is intrinsically a non-explanation. This notion that ID is an explanatory non-starter is unobjectionable to all who share the scientific commitment to methodological naturalism. However, Dawkins makes arguments that go beyond the framework of methodological naturalism to promote an aggressive philosophical naturalism, though he does not distinguish the two. For instance, he provides an argument of sorts against the existence of God at the end of the book, one rooted in his scientific quest to understand the development of complexity: “It would be untamed chance if once there was no eye, and then, suddenly, in the twinkling of a generation, an eye appeared, fully fashioned, perfect and whole. This is possible, but the odds against it will keep us busy writing noughts till the end of time. The same applies to the odds against the spontaneous existence of any fully fashioned, perfect and whole beings, including-I see no way of avoiding the conclusion-deities.” (p.317) Of course, this argument is rather strange, since it does not take into account the possibility of an eternal God. Based on the aforementioned p. 141 quote, and despite his willingness to tackle the question of the existence of God, apparently Dawkins thinks the notion that God is eternal is only worth mentioning when it is part of a scientifically illegitimate approach the topic of biological complexity.Methodological naturalism not only legitimates but also delimits science’s proper sphere of authority, giving space for other forms of intellectual inquiry. Dawkins’s general intellectual approach can be seen as a form of scientism, which jettisons the notion that science has any limits. When the famous atheist Antony Flew changed his mind and became a deist based in large part upon the origin of life issue as it it appears in the aftermath of Watson & Crick, he made a point of framing his argument as philosophic rather than scientific in nature. Similarly, Francis Collins, a leading theistic evolutionist, is quite clear that this intellectual worldview does not constitute a scientific theory. Collins, who strongly opposes the notion that ID should be considered science, wrote a highly positive review of Flew’s book Why There Is A God. Although Collins’s outlook on the origin of life differs from Flew’s, and though the two men have very different conceptions of the Deity, they share a commitment to methodological naturalism in science and the pursuit of truth beyond science. Both former atheists profoundly altered their entire worldview based on this pursuit. Dawkins’s especially aggressive scientism leaves no room for such intellectual quests, nor for the answers that Collins and Flew found on their journeys. In TBW, Dawkins views theistic evolution (which he calls guided evolution) as illegitimate. His case against the theistic evolutionists is that they smuggle God into their account of evolution at some point. And Collins’s explicit distancing of theistic evolution from scientific theory matters not one bit to Dawkins or his followers. In Dawkins’s scientistic account, darwinian evolution and theism are irreconcilable, and Darwin wins the contest. And though I have not read The God Delusion, it seems obvious that in this later book the hostility to religion intensifies, as Dawkins utilizes an evolutionary approach to understanding religion that treats/disparages it as a parasitic meme. As for Antony Flew, Dawkins’s response to his turn to deism was to speak of his senility and possible exploitation by others. I find Dawkins’s aggressive scientism un-compelling, off-putting, and even a bit alarming. Though attacks on evolutionary theory are often dismissed as the reaction of hayseeds who are not yet reconciled to science, Francis Collins makes a fruitful suggestion to the effect that the Intelligent Design “movement” can be considered a reaction to the new atheism/aggressive scientism of thinkers like Dawkins. If scientism proceeds as if there is nothing outside of science’s authoritative judgement, and if a scientistic approach to evolution is being used to wage open war against theism, it is perhaps inevitable that this would provoke a pushback attempt to seek God in science. Collins’s opinion regarding the importance of new atheism for the intelligent design movement might be questioned by asking whether Dawkins is really that influential. I would readily concede that the aggressively anti-religious aspect of his writings is not representative of the work of the vast majority of evolutionary biologists. However, unlike most scientists, he is an amazingly popular author and an undeniable public intellectual, and he has plenty of open disciples and collaborators. In addition, his outlook seems to have much institutional support. Dawkins was the University of Oxford’s Professor for the Public Understanding of Science from 1995 to 2008. If this doesn’t mark Dawkins as an establishment figure, I don’t know what would. If Collins’s opinion regarding the new atheism’s relationship to ID has some validity, then it would seem to follow that the most effective way for those who view the ID movement with dismay to take the wind out of its sails would be to crusade against the aggressive scientism represented by Dawkins as much as they do against the books produced by the Discovery Institute.Dawkins’s aggressive, anti-theistic approach to the topic of evolution can be distinguished from the evolutionary theory he champions. The fact that Dawkins dubiously wields the issue of design as a club against theism says nothing regarding the truth or falsity of neo-darwinism. Personally, though I believe in evolution understood as common descent with modification, I am open to the idea that perhaps neo-darwinian mechanisms are less important for understanding evolution than mainstream evolutionary biology takes them to be. My general sense is that Jerry Fodor is probably right when he says that Darwin did for natural history what Marx did for history generally by placing it under control of a “theory,” and that such 19c optimism in the power of science was misplaced, since “history, whether natural or otherwise, is par excellence the locus of explanations that do not conform to the Newtonian paradigm.” (An aside on Fodor: It should go without saying that although Fodor thinks it wrong to conceive of random mutation/natural selection-or any other set of mechanisms- as the engine that drives evolution, he does think there are obviously plenty of persuasive adaptationist accounts for particular episodes in natural history.) If Fodor is correct, then darwinism itself represents a form of scientism, though certainly in a milder, less culturally imperialistic form than Dawkins’s anti-theistic version. However, if it is assumed that evolutionary science can conquer natural history by placing it under control of a theory, it is not much of a leap to assume that evolutionary science can conquer anything else it has a mind to.Regardless of whether or not neo-darwinism represents a form of scientism, and irrespective of the theory’s scientific merits, reading Dawkins helped me to better appreciate ways in which neo-darwinism proves resistant to criticism. On pg. 91 of The Blind Watchmaker, Dawkins says that “One Hundred and twenty years on, we know a lot more about animals and plants than Darwin did, and still not a single case is known to me of a complex organ that could not have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications.” This sounds like quite impressive support for Darwin’s theory. Yet near the very end of the book, Dawkins baldly states that “No matter how improbable it is that an X could have arisen from a Y in a single step, it is always possible to conceive of a series of infinitesimally graded intermediates between them.” (p.317) The first quote doesn’t seem so impressive in light of the second. Surely, no theory is self-validating. However, with neo-darwinism, certain evidentiary concerns do tend to be shrugged off as if to say “it is always possible to conceive.” For instance, given the mind bogglingly large time frames Dawkins emphasizes that evolution relies on, it is plausible to say to the critics that it is unrealistic to expect that we’ll ever be able to model in much detail how certain complex structures likely emerged. Relatedly, the fossil record that one could argue leaves much to be desired from a neo-darwinian point of view is necessarily an incomplete window into the past. So, for someone who already assumes that darwinism is sound, the lack of specificity regarding pathways to complexity and the problematic fossil record need not disturb assumptions, because there are built-in responses for dealing with them. This is an effective practical way to blunt criticism. Furthermore, anyone somewhat skeptical of mainstream evolutionary thinking who rules out intelligent design as science really has no generally effective retort to Dawkins’s proclamation in TBW that “The theory of evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only theory we know of that is in principle capable of explaining the existence of organized complexity.” (pg. 317) Now, precisely because I tend to agree with Fodor that the notion of any one overarching theory of evolution is misguided, I think that the development of other credible theories is a necessary requirement for breaking the spell of darwinian hegemony. Self organization theory seems to me to hold some promise for explaining the existence of organized complexity, and Dawkins did not deal with self organization theory as a potential rival in his book, probably because Stuart Kauffman had yet to write his self-organization texts by 1986. Even so, as is commonly said, self-organization is as of yet more slogan than reality. One might try replying to Dawkins that just because the critics of neo-darwinism have no satisfying alternate explanation, that doesn’t mean that the establishment theory is sound. However, this approach is not likely to change many minds. Also, since the only Darwin doubters who do claim to have a satisfying explanation for organized complexity are creationists of some sort, simply to question mainstream evolutionary thinking is to invite hostility on the assumption that such questioning ultimately aids the creationists. (Fodor’s personal example is instructive here.) One sees this dynamic at work in TBW. Dawkins very sincerely views dissenters from neo-darwinism with suspicion and/or wariness, because he thinks they are motivated by, or at least will be exploited by, a scientifically discredited but still troublesomely influential creationist point of view. I am obviously no fan of Dawkins, but I’m glad I read TBW. Dawkins is a good writer, and has an almost evangelical enthusiasm for his topic. These qualities made it fairly easy to get through the book: it was not an unenjoyable read. In addition, Dawkins’s book-though more that 30 years old-was scientifically informative in certain respects for this lay reader. Also, since Dawkins really has achieved the status of a public intellectual, reading this book gives one insight into how many people think about evolution and its cultural implications. Relatedly, Dawkins’s aggressive anti-theistic scientism raises a whole host of issues and questions worth thinking about. Finally, reading Dawkins helped me better appreciate that whatever valid criticisms one can make regarding mainstream evolutionary theory, those hoping for or even anticipating some sort of major paradigm shift should probably not hold their breath."
556,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2520231-sophie,4,"I was worried that this would be a difficult read because the last time I felt confident about my knowledge of the natural sciences was in like the 10th grade, but it was a really, really good read. Dawkins is much more interesting and enjoyable when he writes about his field of expertise than when he writes about religion. I mean, I'm an atheist and I think what he argues for in The God Delusion is pretty much on the mark, but in hindsight the difference between that book and this one is massive. His arguments in The God Delusion are often quite poor and simplistic (see: 'Here are three ways in which religion has unique, specific harms: *proceeds to list three things which are in no way unique to religion*' and the debater in me groans.) I think people are usually at their best when they get to talk about things they are passionate about (and not in a bitter way.) His enthusiasm for the wonders of nature really comes through, and you can tell he put a lot of thought into how best to discuss various concepts in lay terms. I was baffled by the computer program biomorphs at the beginning and was afraid that whatever noodling you could get down to on a mid-80s Mac would be hopelessly irrelevant today, but they turned out to be an excellent source for metaphors to understand natural selection, a thread wound cleverly throughout the book. I also liked the fact that he discussed some rival theories to neo-Darwinism in later chapters, both current and historical, but wasted no more than a few words on creationism, which is about as much as it deserves. (He did highlight the way creationists try to publicly hijack any *seemingly* anti-Darwinian ideas brough up in the scientific community, which is important.)Overall a very accessible and compelling book, will probs come back to it every now and then. (The bits about bats are amazing. Bats are amazing.)"
557,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Evolution is not for everyone. In a way, it is also faith and Dawkins is an ardent preacher. He makes excellent arguments on how evolution works on well-hidden axioms. Some of the concepts described in the book are astounding - like the concepts of cumulative selection or the vastness of time. The lucidity with which the basic message is hammered repeatedly, along with diversity of examples and interspersing of tales from other fields make the book a truly magnificent read. Even the ardent evolution non-believers are likely to walk away with many questions if they read the book dispassionately. Yet, the book suffers from two faults: most of the book appears like an attack on the arguments of god- or religion-believers rather than a good science by itself. Texts describing any good theories should spend most of the time elaborating itself rather than creating supposed critiques' strawmen and shooting them down. The book also tends to attack the most average religious arguments rather than those more evolved.The bigger problem is the book's inability to recognize the axioms that lie at the heart of evolution theory. Whether Euclidean or Big Bang, every theory starts perforce starts with hypotheses that can not be proven. If there is any god, a believer can argue, he is the one setting those axioms. The rest may simply build on itself, in the most fanatic case with a minor bit of divine intervention here and there. While the presence or absence of axioms of a certain kind can never prove or disprove any creator, a good rationalist like Dawkins should have spelled the axioms of the evolutionary theory better.All that said, this is a great book for anyone who is not a specialist in the field."
558,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82803739-antonio,4,"Having read 'The Selfish Gene' prior to 'The Blind Watchmaker', I already knew Dawkins' writing style, and I (roughly) knew what to expect from this book.I found Dawkin's explanation of Darwinism clear and accessible, its keypoints recurrently repeated over the entire book so there would be no mistake the reader (even the one not trained in biology) could put off the book and walk away with a wrong idea about evolution and natural selection. I thoroughly enjoyed the chapters about echolocation and about the idea of life originating from 'clay-crystals replicators' (which I never encountered before although I am trained in biology, and which put my imagination under consistent stress), as well as the one about the arms races, BUT (yes, there is a but) I was not expecting to find myself tangled in the countless arguments Dawkins uses to prove his point against other theories proposed to explain evolution, which were at times tedious and boring. Neverthless, I think Dawkins felt compelled to tackle the subject as comprehensively as possible and I am sure that the book would have been diminished if he decided to omit at least some of those arguments, reason why I feel I can forgive him (not completely, though) for the hard time he gave me when going past certain chapters, especially the last two.Overall, I think 'The Blind Watchmaker' can be an interesting and illuminating read for anyone eager to understand the real workings of evolution and selection, with the warning that the reader may sometimes need to equip himself with a good pair of 'mental running shoes' (as Dawkins says in the books) and a good deal of patience to get through some parts which may feel unnecessary and boring."
559,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41603992-abraham,5,"The undeniably amazing complexity of living organisms has been taken as incontrovertible evidence for the existence of a divine being who intelligently designed every life form here on earth (along with the whole rest of the universe). In 'The Blind Watchmaker', Richard Dawkins argues that this complexity is actually the result of the cumulative selection, over millions of years, of genes which conferred survival and reproductive benefits on their phenotypes.Such benefits could have been absolutely tiny - imagine the eyes of two creatures, one pair of which focused milliseconds quicker than the other, allowing their possessor to start fleeing a predator fractionally quicker and thereby living to reproduce another day. Nonetheless, over time they add up to create the complex organisms that currently populate our planet.After making this main point, Dawkins discusses various nuances - for example, is the rate of adaptation steady over time, or does it happen in fits and starts, and in keeping with environmental changes? After this, he debunks some interesting alternative theories, not limited to creationism. Lamarckism stood out for me - the idea that physical characteristics you acquire during your life (for example, the large muscles of a body-builder) can be passed on to your offspring - this theory was popular not for its (non-existent) scientific credibility but because it tied in neatly with certain political ethoses of the day - for example, communism with its heroic muscular workers etc etc. That factor is probably a whole subject in itself - reading recommendations welcome! "
560,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7188699-abhaga,3,"After fussing over for the longest time about which Richard Dawkins book to read, I picked this one up. Turns out, not a great choice.The book is informative and also gives you a good idea of basic evolution process in first 3-4 chapters. But there are two major problems. One is that many of the later chapters are written as responses to specific challenges and questions posed by opponents or different groups within evolutionists. The responses are well crafted and satisfactory but you have no idea if those are the major questions or difficulties faced by the theory of evolution - things that it struggles to explain. This is not a fault of the book but for this reason, I will not recommend this as the first book to read about Evolution.Second problem is with the repetitive, rambling writing style of Dawkins. He repeats the same thing so many times that it starts getting on your nerves. I even took to cursory reading in some places after a while. I understand that he is writing as an apologist but to a convert looking for deeper understanding, it sounds like preaching to the choir.But those two niggles aside, he destroys critics and objections pretty thoroughly, sticking in multiple pins even when the first one would have done the job. In that sense, he allows you to develop a deeper and well rounded understanding of Evolutionary worldview. I am looking forward to reading his other books as well, hoping he has done a better job of writing those."
561,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19027675-keith,2,"I just found a copy of The Blind Watchmaker, Why the evidence for evolution reveals a universe without design, at a library sale and began reading it. Besides being 30 years out of date (which may or may not be relevant), it is annoyingly written. Dawkins wrote in a drunken sailor’s walk way (with frequent parentheticals (of which more later)) with frequent (and often interrupted) digressions. Those last sentences are positively cogent by his standards, but illustrative of the scattered style. I found myself skipping paragraphs as soon as I had sussed their gist rather than slogging through them endlessly. No matter what the blurbs say, The Blind Watchmaker was not easy reading because it so undirected. Really, you can talk about an “arms race” without devoting so much ink to suggesting that your analogy could be about the USA and USSR, but doesn’t necessarily have to have named participants nor do they need to have those exact ideologies. Unfortunately, Richard Dawkins couldn’t in this book. Perhaps he needed to give more credit to the reader’s intelligence.Much of the book is spent on Dawkins’ disagreements with other evolutionists, such as Eldridge and Gould (punctuated equilibrium), Dover (molecular drive) and schools of taxonomy. The made up dialog between his impression of a real-life and an extreme caricature Darwinists failed to entertain or enlighten.I would have given The Blind Watchmaker a higher rating had I not been worn down by Dawkins’ style and disorganization."
562,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11507273-hasan,5,"Richard Dawkins wrote this book in order to show how the complexity of life on earth could have arisen by the apparently blind and ""random"" forces of nature. The catch of course being that evolution by natural selection is anything but random since organisms that are better suited to survive and reproduce tend to saturate the environment with copies of themselves and while the specific advantages that some individuals might enjoy over their peers might come from random mutations, natural selection decidedly is not random. On the way we meet a number of theories that have been posited as alternatives to Neo-Darwinism and we find ourselves dealing with the explanatory power of these rival theories and in some cases, the astronomical odds against some part of these theories being true. This book might not be the best for someone who believes that evolution by natural selection is true especially if one is familiar with the basic arguments that might be presented in favour of the theory. And while I would consider myself in this group, I certainly learned a great deal from this book. Perhaps my idea of skeptically examining every argument put forth by Dawkins did pay off. I am thinking of reading Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea next. I tried reading it before but perhaps I will find it more illuminating this time around. It might be a good place for other readers of this book to continue their investigation into this topic too. "
563,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,4,"I could have never imagined that reading about biology and evolution can be such a delight. The subject is presented in a structured and simple enough (to an extent possible) way, topped with the poetic style of Dawkins. I cannot help admiring Dawkins more and more for promoting reason and evidence above everything else when it comes to matters of science. The book is essentially an answer to a very common argument against the theory of evolution, which goes like this ""How could have an organ so complex as a heart/eye/brain/wings/etc.. have evolved by random mutation and natural selection? Unless all the composite parts of that organ were all at the same time present, this organ would have been useless for the animal"". I myself used to wonder about this a lot, which is one of the reasons in picked up the book. It was very fulfilling to find the clear answers supported by evidence to most of my questions. There are no attempts to trick, confuse, appeal to your on beliefs...just plain evidence, fact, knowledge. The reason I am giving this book 4 stars is because, for me, the subject of speciation was not adequately addressed. This particular gap for me will have to be filled by another book apparently. "
564,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/520483-serene,4,"Dawkins has a down-to-earth, humorous at times, way of explaining difficult concepts in a simple manner. His presentation of evolution as traveling through a ""space"" of animals, his discussion of Cairns-Smith's theory of the origin of life, and his explanation of the variable rates that evolution might proceed at were all fascinating. I understood evolution much better after reading this, particularly on the genetic level (which my high-school education treated only lightly.)Except for the occasional pot-shot, he stays out of discussing religion at all, which is just as well, because I don't think he quite gets it. For example, he says that God is not an acceptable explanation of the complexity of the universe because He would already have to be more complex than what he created. But the faithful don't claim to have a 100% comprehensive delineation of all of existence any more that Darwinism can claim to be completely comprehensive. Apparently he has a hard time accepting that there may be some things we may never know."
565,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2242165-tyler,2,"I'm a little disappointed here. This was my introduction to Richard Dawkins, and maybe I just picked the wrong book. I was hoping to learn more about the fascinating world of evolutionary biology, but instead got a long-winded, all-over-the-map apologetic response to Creationism and various oddities like Lamarckism and Punctuationism.This really is an odd book, with the first hundred pages or so mostly devoted to Dawkins's own little computer programming exercise to demonstrate how cumulative selection works. It was still fun reading in parts, especially when he talks about specific animal traits such as echolocation in bats, or the development of the eye in different organisms. I may come back to Dawkins again, maybe The Ancestor's Tale or The Selfish Gene or something. I suppose this book serves its purpose in defending Darwinism against those who feel threatened by it, but if you're well past that already you can probably pass on this book as well."

I don't disagree with anything Dawkins is claiming, so don't take this poor rating as meaning his book is full of errors or that I dislike him/his claims. It just did a very, consistently good job of putting me to sleep. There was a small section of the book (a chapter or two) that I would give five stars to that discussed the origins of self-replication and mutation in non-living substances like clay. It was extremely thought-provoking and (ABSOLUTELY KEY) wasn't something I was already familiar with. The chapter on positive feedback, which focused on non-useful traits that could only be related to sexual attraction, was also reasonably interesting, if a bit drawn out. But most of it was extremely dry.My guess is that this book was fresh information when it was published in 1986, but even as someone with very little formal education in biology, in 2014, 90% of it just wasn't worth my time.

Evolution is awesome! We have a lot to learn from it."" That said, the last 2-3 chapters felt like a bit of a drag and were a little hard to understand; maybe they'll make more sense on the 2nd reading.

This is definitely not light reading, but for anyone doubtful of the truth of Darwinism and evolution by natural selection, or for believers who just want to know more, this is great.It's basically an argument for how evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only rational argument out there that can explain how the first replicating cells gave rise to organised complexity in the form of living things, in all our diversity, which all have structures and/or organs well-suited to that organism's particular environment and that therefore improve the probability of survival and reproduction of the responsible genes.Intelligent design seems like a reasonable explanation if you don't have the scientific knowledge to provide alternative reasoning. With the relevant scientific knowledge, as we are privileged to now have, natural selection makes sense. And it is awesome, literally."

A good reread, because now I wasn't annoyed by the examples. Quite interesting, it is really written from the point of view that Darwin's evolution theory is the only one that can be true. Also funny to read that he is really expecting wonderful things from moleculair research. 30 Years later a lot has happenend in this world, so it is good to remind that Darwin theory is still standing. "
570,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."
572,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610244-arjen,5,"This is the third book by Richard Dawkins I read and another winner. The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""

575,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

Dawkins expertly makes the case for evolution though the people who refuse to accept it are, generally speaking, not the type to be swayed by evidence and logic and not the audience for this book."
577,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

579,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "
580,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13307338-robert-day,4,"I've got reviewers block.To overcome this, I'm going to write a page of absolute garbage that may only be tangentially related to this book. In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
581,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
582,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
583,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
584,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
586,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
587,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
588,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
589,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."

I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."

As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

I bought this book not long after it was published, and for some reason it was relegated to an obscure bookshelf until recently. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written. In fact, if anything, subsequent research has confirmed many of the speculations made in the book. Highly recommended."

Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."
597,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84134671-fabio-brady,4,"Dawkins delves into the details to give the reader a more modern understanding and well-rounded overview of Evolution by Natural Selection.The author asserts that the designer of life is a mindless automatic process, the Blind Watchmaker (evolution), that guides species to adaptive complexity. Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."

The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid. This makes the book longer and slower than it needs to be."
599,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62086210-sabbir-saadat,4,"Another master class from Dr. Dawkins. Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "
600,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Common people, not necessarily trained in biology. The purpose of the book is to make everybody familiar with the theory of evolution.About the author: Richard Dawkins is a British author, biologist, and ethologist. He was born on March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya. He embraced Christianity as a young boy. However, during his teens, he embraced Darwinism instead. Dawkins is claimed to be the “world’s most famous atheist.” He opposes religion, criticizes creationism and intelligent design. He is one of the main founders of the New Atheism movement. He describes Islam to be the greatest force of evil in today’s world. He is the author of seven books.Structure of the book: The book is divided in 11 chapters with a unique title.Overview: The book has the suggestive subtitle “Why the evidence of evolution reveals a universe without design.” One of its purposes is to refute the criticisms to his previous book, The Selfish Gene (1976). Although The Blind Watchmaker was originally published in 1986, more than 30 years ago, this is still a great piece of evolutionary theory that patiently and persuasively addresses the topic of how nature achieved its complexity and variety. It is full of bright metaphor and happy analogies that express Dawkins passion and enthusiasm.The Blind Watchmaker is a name taken from the watchmaker analogy in William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802). Paley, an advocate of creationism, basically said that the evolution of life on earth is like a watch in its complexity and consequently it is necessarily the work of an intelligent designer or watchmaker. Dawkins, on the other hand, is an evolutionist. And in this book he responds to Paley’s argument.Dawkins explains the theory of evolution using terms that are understandable to the public not trained in biology. He describes how complex biological structures (such as the eye), as well as behavior (such as echolocation in bats), could have originated from random mutation of every DNA and protein systems that is caused by natural selection. In the case of the eye, he argues, it started in a simple organism as an organ that could merely distinguish light and dark. Then, through some small modifications, it could finally reach the mammalian eye with its complexity. The creatures in between these extremes have eyes that represent intermediate levels of complexity. All organs evolve and this evolution of organs increases our chances of survival. Therefore, the evolution and existence of life do not require a designer.Dawkins also argues that natural selection occurred with various random mutations in a very long period of time. Mutations create new possibilities, while natural selection removes the bad ones. This is in fact evolution, not pure genetic randomness. However, evolution stops at a point where the benefit of arm races gets uneconomical. For example, if cheetahs continue to evolve and run faster, their muscles will have to grow bigger and consume more energy. Thus cheetahs won’t have much energy left for anything else to do. In most cases, the preys will continue to develop more ability for arm races since they need them for their lives.Dawkins also introduces the concept of “hierarchical reductionism,” which can be used for explaining complex systems. These systems should be divided into subcomponents, and these subcomponents should, in turn, be divided into sub-subcomponents until we reach the elementary particles of these systems.Dawkins presents a computer model of artificial selection to show evolutionary possibilities. He performed experiments where evolutionary modeling program generated two-dimensional shape (“bimorphs”) that looked like spiders, scorpions and bats. However, the computer could not select the direction. He shows how cumulative random mutations can lead to the occurrence of adaptations.Dawkins also discusses miracles that he describes as a set of natural events (rather than supernatural) but they fall on the extreme far end of improbability. The main miracle in the book is that of the origin of life. The author discusses the statistics involved in miracles and how we can compute the probability that we, as humans, may not be the sole intelligent creatures in the universe.Quote:  That the watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction and designed its use.Strong points: Dawkins is an atheist, but his book offers a careful consideration of the various sides of the debate. He moves gradually to the big picture. He has many fascinating things to discuss and you can sense his enthusiasm and passion for the topic as you read his work. He also uses terms that can be understood by nearly anyone and thus the book can have a wide target audience. Dawkins tackles the topic head on. He shows the reader how to find out things on his own. We can even still check the results of his computer experiments nowadays on our computers.Weak points: If you are a strong believer and an adept of creationism, the book itself can be easily perceived as a weak point. Some might argue that the book could not strongly refute the presence of a designer on scientific grounds, but rather on philosophical grounds. The author chose to accept only those things that can be explained as true, so he described the presence of creating and designing God to explain nothing and therefore he discarded this assumption. The book also refused to consider miracles to be supernatural events but Christians believe them to be God’s way of revealing himself._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"

What a mind-boggling theory of such astonishing scope and implications, it is almost inconceivable that a single human being could have given us the theory of evolution.I think I studied it in class 9 and read it as another scientific theory. The conflict with religion didnt even enter my mind. Haa bhai hum evolve hue hai, Ok. Realised recently it is crucial for believers in Abrahamic religions to prove it false. Darwinism is a gr8 leap towards atheism. And one of its most known advocates is the author of the book Richard Dawkins.This was my fifth book by the author and contrary to public perception, you can feel that Dawkins is really in love with science. His writing is lucid as he really wishes to share his joy with you. And I think he is kinder than me to bullies n bullshitters :) In this book too, some chapters are a joy to read and some concepts related to evolution are explained very well. After ""The Selfish Gene"" which dealt with how genes and not individual organism is the unit that drives evolution, and ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" which described experiments that show how evolution is actually happening. This was more focused on showing how there is no divine intervention in evolution but unfortunately in some chapters it got repetitive and with excessive jargon. Also, I was unconvinced by the chapter on the origin of life. Still, a good read to understand about evolution and will be reading more by the author."
602,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610244-arjen,5,"This is the third book by Richard Dawkins I read and another winner. The other two being The God Delusion and The Selfish Gene.Whereas The God Delusion is an angry book and The Selfish Gene a book of insight, The Blind Watchmaker is a book of calm and lucid explanation. Dawkins explains Darwins theory of evolution in his trademark clear, witty and highly readable style. He has the talent to break down complex concepts in understandable bits and often uses enlightening analogies to clarify his reasoning.One of the things I especially liked about this book is that it not only provides an explanation and insight about the inner working of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it also shows why, where and how rival or opposing theories are wrong. Or even cannot be right. Dawkins does this in a most respectful way. With one exception, my favourite chapter, chapter 10: The One True Tree of Life; it starts with about 25 pages of explanation of the interesting science of taxonomy and classification and treats all schools of thought with depth and respect. Until you arrive at the final pages of the chapter where you can just feel the anger seeping through the pages. It builds up a brilliant tension towards the conclusion in which he absolutely crushes Nelson and Platnicks sensationalism in the most British of ways, only the end the chapter with the genius sentence:""Now I'd better go out and dig the garden, or something"""

605,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"In a Pennsylvania supreme court case (where someone wants the school district to teach intelligent design as an alternative theory to students ""to broaden their mind""), an expert witness articulated a subtle but important distinction between every day use and scientific use of the word ""theory"". In everyday use, theory (as in conspiracy theory) often means belief. I often have to explain to grad students that beliefs are separated into ""conjectures"" (any random beliefs); ""hypotheses"" (beliefs that can be tested against experimental observations); and theories/laws (beliefs that are so well tested and not a single credible counter-example has been found, so we'll do well to take them as truth until they are overthrown by a better theory). A hypothesis that is disproven, btw, is just garbage now. Those who want the school district to teach ""intelligent design"" argues Darwinian evolution is ""just a theory"" -- they are right about that, but they are using theory in the scientific sense (as in truth). With that definition, intelligent design is pure conjecture, not even a hypothesis (and in some sense more useless than garbage). Most people do not appreciate that the theory of Darwinian evolution is a very robust scientific theory. Dawkins wrote countless books to educate us. This book is one of them. The title is a reference to the seemingly good argument of Paley that if I see a watch on the ground, I infer there is a watch maker that made the watch. This is all good and well, but the real question is when I see a watch maker, do I infer a watchmaker maker. If you answer yes, then why stop there: who made the watchmaker-maker. The point is, invoking God is not settling the matter, but merely swept the complexity underneath the vague notion of a deity. And evolution is a perfectly good answer -- which over ~200 years has not only held up, but actually strengthened as scientists understood genetics. Evolution is a very long process that is hard to fully grasp, leading to many objectionable caricatures of the theory. What is objectionable are the caricatures themselves. The author went through 11 chapters covering a rather comprehensive array of misunderstanding, caricatures, and downright misleading propaganda (from the creationists).One caricature is that nature inventing eye in one step (or two) is incredible -- how can ""half of an eye"" be any useful? The reality is changes are much more gradual and having any light sensitivity is better than none, granting survival advantage.Another is how can randomness create wonderful designs such as eyes. The answer is that mutations are random, evolution is decidedly not. Another one is natural selection is a negative force, weeding out failures, how can it be a positive, constructive force. This is not very different from sculpturing, which is a negative process resulting in positive result (complexity).There are also subtler issues. For instance, when punctuationists came along, they wanted to emphasize a subtle point of their insight and claimed that maybe the jump in fossil record is not because the record is incomplete but rather the very process of evolution itself is ""rapid changes punctuated by long-term stasis"" (hence ""punctuationists""). Even this is misleading. The abrupt change in fossil record is not documenting an event of evolution as much as an event of migration. The list goes on and on. In addition to deepening the understanding of the subject, reading Dawkins is a delight. He is a very lucid writer. He explains things with precision language that is also easy to the understand. He uses analogies and consistently tells you when the analogy breaks down. Even if you don't care about evolution, the writing itself is worth browsing."

Dawkins expertly makes the case for evolution though the people who refuse to accept it are, generally speaking, not the type to be swayed by evidence and logic and not the audience for this book."
607,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12941859-igor-veloso,4,"I don’t give a rat about God.It’s blunt and its heretical, but that’s how I feel about the spirituality thing.Not going into detail of course, but I admit this because The Blind Watchmaker and Richard Dawkins are always associated with atheism and religion much more than biology, with this book being recommended as one to read and lend to your average Christian. With that said, I can’t tell you whether this does a good job at questioning the existence of an Intelligent Designer or not, or at least, go into specifics in that direction. My objective reading this one is to learn how evolutionary biology speaks of DNA replication, get ideas on how to better understand it and The Selfish Gene position from the author. But I’ll try to lay out the objective of the book. ObjectiveDawkins could expose all the theories in chemistry and biology, that being the correct thing to do in a compendium. This book is not a compendium. Its an answer, understandable to everyone, to The Blind Watchmaker fallacy (or analogy) made famous by apologist William Paley. The analogy goes simply like this: a design implies a designer. You don’t think why a rock is a rock and why its there, but if you find a watch, then nature itself simply can’t make something so complex and remarkable. There has to be an artificer. Literally he speaks like this:In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. ... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use...[…] by William PaleyDawkin’s idea for this book is that its not necessary to postulate a creator to understand life or any other thing in the Universe. He won’t go around picking on christians and pleading to eat babies. He simply urges the reader to comprehend the analogy made by its author and then read this book, although he also finds the general idea to be enough, because he’ll only spit biology from now on.MethodIn short, he starts to lay down the basis of gene replication and how it will influence the creation of phenotypes to help organisms on their environment (eyes, wings, etc). Starts talking about bats and showing all its skills and what he lacks, then presents solutions as a designer (say an engineer), to solve the bat’s problems. With this he shows there are intelligent ways to perfect creatures yet they are created imperfect by nature itself through various natural mutations. Other popular example is the giraffe’s neck.He also uses a boring but useful computer program to make visual presentations of mutations in the genes. It does a good job and think it was a smart way to do it.Dawkins has high respect for pre-modern theologians, considering them much more honest toward their views of God and argument presentation. However, he does admit modern apologists to be full of rhetoric, acting like lawyers whose job is to win the debate and the case, provoking mental gymnastics and sometimes still using arguments by Personal Incredulity. It does not mean he hates Christians or Christianity, but finds some of its individuals too fluent in hurting scientific thought.That’s about it. A paragraph to mention his position. Most of the book is spent criticizing other biologists and compare data, mainly Stephen Jay Gould, another evolutionary biologist. He is also known as the «accidental creationist» because he criticized neo-Darwinism, yet he was neither creationist or Christian. He was simply “adopted” by Apologists because he was something of a “legit source” to combat the heresy of Darwinism. Such association would come to make more harm than good to him, who is an evolutionist and agnostic. NOTE: This book is Pre – CRISPR-CAS9 and some animal gene mapping. Earlier editions might have more recent data, specially about the Primordial Soup. Dawkins uses this theory as the origin of life and claims RNA came before DNA. Much more is known about that theory now, so much it came at a “crisis” in 2010 if I’m not mistaken, and since then, its an incredibly debatable theory. Regardless, its the one mostly accepted.Dawkins vs GouldDawkins is all about the «Selfish Gene», where various bits of DNA are replicated and distributed throughout the world and its individuals, being enough to trigger behaviour such as altruism. The more individuals are related, the more stable is the lineage. As far as phenotypes go, he doesn’t go much farther than the eyes and nose. (Phenotypes are expressions of the gene. Ex: organism needs to see in a certain environment, therefore DNA needs eyes to lead its host to reproduce.) Anything cultural are nothing but ideals that replicate (what he calls memes), originating in the environment and values enforced. Its less about the gene and more about “cultural adaptation” so to speak.Gould, on the other hand, is about «Group Selection», where the gene acts in favour of the group instead of the individual. It kind of creates this idea of the gene is “aware” although not necessarily. It simply shows competition can be between groups instead of individuals. Say a gene replicated in a group of altruistic individuals who help each other. Those individuals will compete as a group instead of a within the group. Its phenotypes however can extend much more than the eyes or the nose. In Group Selection, religion is a phenotype. Monogamy too. They are adaptations fitting for a certain group of genes to reproduce, providing safe environment and social status.Anyway, memes and gene replication from both biologists are given to the reader (with Dawkins saying why his idea is correct), with the function of helping realize the gene is virtually a self driving force with clear objectives, that while some results may be random, selection is causal. Which also does not mean random chemical receptions and reactions in the cells aren’t a thing. He explains which.Life in the UniverseAt the time, he seemed to not believe there was life in the universe beyond Earth. Or at least, the possibilities are almost null. He doesn’t go very deep in this, he continues on about Primordial Soup, but In physics is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle: the observable physical and cosmological values aren’t likely to be probable anywhere else, because the requirements are restrictive. Ok, what it means is we are privileged mofos and this corner of the universe is just fine. So fine you can’t have it anywhere else. Nowadays however we know that “Life finds a way”.Sceptics of Natural SelectionMajority of sceptics are ready to accept there may be occasional minor modifications, like a darker colour that evolved in various species of moth […] But, once that one is accepted, they call to attention the smallness of such mutation. […] “it’s not a new species” they say. Later in the book he does admit to some interesting things. The last two chapters are questionably necessary, although I found them important info to absorb. Starts with some palaeontology, goes on about lamarckism, mutationism and neutralism. Warns of the fake human footprints in dinosaur fossils to gather tourist attention during the depression (which reminds me of the human skeleton inside a dinosaur skeleton, which also proved BS when dating them, and then was called conspiracy. I find this ridiculous. While improbable, a biologist finding humans in the same space and date as dinosaurs, would definitely make things much more interesting. Besides, we know now apes and dinosaurs coexisted. Creationism sometimes just wants evolutionists to be wrong instead of the science be done right.) He explains how taxonomy works and its various branches (not taxidermy, my friends. that’s something else.)And finally:There are various Anti – Darwinism classes and he classifies three: (1) religiously motivated, that want evolutionism itself not to be true; (2) groups with no reason to deny it, but because of political and ideological ideas, consider Darwinism of bad taste, cruel and implacable; confuse natural selection with social darwinism, of racist and eugenics connotations; confuse natural selection with “randomness”, hence “absence of meaning”; (3) media just want to piss on everyone's soup, true or not, what matters is to rattle the population, shape public opinion towards any ideal and the quick buck.Last wordsI shudder to think, while I never lived in a religiously oppressive environment, environmental opinions from people who were religious still shaped me to avoid and criticize men like Dawkins during my high school to early twenties (one year university) life. If I was stronger mentally, I would have absorbed evolutionary biology for what it is and followed the proper authorities for much longer. I took these men for their religious and philosophical opinions (ironically, Dawkins is not a philosopher at all, he’s all about the science) instead of their educational value. Maybe at the time I needed friends, the girl and status more than education and now I’m paying the “bill”. Regardless, biology ties in perfectly with my main interests of Anthropology and History. Until now I’ve avoided Dawkins but not the subject...but now I’ll study both. Other experts on the field: Jared Diamond, Francis Collins, Jane Goodall, Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, David M. Buss, Steven Pinker, Harvey Whitehouse. Can research them on Goodreads."

609,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"There’s a certain kind of appreciation that comes from watching someone who is highly skilled in their field whether it’s a musician, sports figure, surgeon or dancer. This is also the same feeling I get when reading a book by Richard Dawkins with regards to his ability to communicate complex scientific topics using clever analogies in a way that crystallizes the subject matter. He is such a good science communicator that I’ll often gain new insight about a topic I thought I already knew from his writing. In The Blind Watchmaker Dawkins examines the evidence for ‘design’ in nature using examples such as the human eye, the echo-location abilities of bats, the absurdly long tail of widowbirds and others. He then goes on to show how step-by-step changes over long periods of time caused by genetic mutation coupled with the non-random effects of natural selection can produce animals that are remarkably well suited for their environment in the absence of a conscious designer. Along the way he obliterates ill-informed creationist tropes such as:- That certain adaptions are irreducibly complex. For example, that the eye wouldn’t work without multiple parts (iris, lens, rods, cones, the optic nerve and the parts of the brain that interpret electrical signals) evolving and cooperating in tandem.- Hoyle’s argument that the probability of complex life evolving is “comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein”.- If you found a watch lying in the desert, would you assume that it “spontaneously assembled” itself from the sand and rocks or that it was designed? This also the fallacy from which the books title originated.Each amounts to an argument from incredulity coupled with a paucity of imagination (I can’t imagine how such a thing could happen, therefore god did it). Of course, there are well established scientific answers to each of these objections that can be obtained by reading this book, or through a simple google search. It should be noted, that despite being wrong, and wrong again, creationists continue to push for their ideologically driven views to be taught in public schools alongside evolution despite the fact that they have yet to publish a single peer reviewed scientific paper in a reputable journal. Dawkins also takes aim at the theory of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ popularized by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge and hyped by the authors and the press as a radical departure from established evolutionary theory. Instead he shows how it merely represents a ""minor gloss,"" and an ""interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory"". While it’s always nice to see creationist ideas so utterly destroyed, it’s the facts of evolution itself that makes the book so interesting. Incremental changes over long periods of time coupled with natural selection produces “endless forms most beautiful” and endless fascination for a curious mind. "

In other words I'm going to do what I normally do anyway.Here's the bit where I write about where I got the book and why: I picked this book up at a charity book stall for fifty pence. The cover was dull, but it had 'Dawkins' in big letters and I knew that I'd read a book by him before (The God Delusion) and that I'd almost enjoyed it and that he was famous for being a pain in the posterior regarding religion and evolution and such. It was one of those 'I'll get it just I case I feel like reading it but I'm not going to make an especial effort to read it and it's only fifty pence' kind of purchases. The other thought on my mind was that I'd seen it for full price in Waterstones and the price was therefore bargainous. It kind of takes me back to when I was a kid with no money looking at all the expensive records and books and comics and sweets that I wanted but couldn't have. Then Christmas would come around and I would get some money, but it was never enough to buy everything I wanted so I had to settle for less. And now, when I can afford any book, record or comic my heart desires, I still buy books for fifty pence and listen to free music on the radio and think about all the comics in my attic that I'll never read again because that was something I did back then and the feeling just isn't there anymore. And I think about satiated desires and about how life is empty without an object of desire, yet how frustrating it is to have a desire that cannot be fulfilled due to one lack or another.Then I step back.Take a deep breath.And I look around the room and have a little think.My biggest problem with evolution is that I don't have children.This book is all about the survival of genes, and genes don't survive without children.My genes won't survive and this is one of the most sobering and depressing thoughts I've ever had.Survival of the fittest = my genes being weak.I sat - stock still - staring at those words. Silent on the outside, yet twitching on the inside with the shame of having weak genes.Then I fall into the comforting arms of the thought that these are just thoughts and that this book is just based on thoughts.These things we call thoughts are of little substance (putting aside their consequences of course).It's good to see the word 'evidence' in the title of this book and to remember that the word most commonly associated with evolution is 'theory'.Maybe we'll never know the reality beyond the theories.Maybe it's up to me to decide my own reality.Within limits of course.After all, even those who paint themselves into corners need only wait for the paint to dry."
611,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"A suburb explication of the mechanics of evolution, intended to show how complexity can arise through the ""blind,"" but non-random process of evolution by natural selection. It serves as a sequel to his The Selfish Gene (1976) by extending and generalizing some of the material presented in that earlier work. The Blind Watchmaker (1986) is a classic in the field, and is still referenced by later works, even by the recently broadcast evolution episode of the 2014 TV series ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" (itself a ""reboot"" of the famous 1980 series of the similar name by Carl Sagan).As is common with an older work of science, or really popular science in this case, one could quibble with a few points and details which have been superseded or clarified at a later date, but there is nothing to be gained in doing so in a general book review. If a critic wished to discredit Dawkins, he himself would certainly respond with corrections, updated reasoning, or simply disagree. Either way, there is no discredit. Another critic who wanted to put forward creationism as an alternative would blast away regardless of any factual errors in the book—or indeed, any truth therein! Furthermore, no one would care what this reviewer said, so I'll let the slight errors stand unreported, and leave them for you the reader to find.Dawkins varies his approach throughout, looking at each topic from multiple angles. As usual he is deeply scientific—meaning, particularly, open to alternatives, if only to rationally destroy them. At the same time, he is not afraid to show himself with occasional humor, impatience, and some instances of irritation. Of course the book is an unapologetic attack on anti-Darwinism, exactly as is should be. It is no fault to attack the forces of untruth with reason. Thus there is some criticism of The Blind Watchmaker for its ""non-scientific passion,"" suggesting passion has no place in science. Well, Copernicus and Galileo were no less passionate for the truth, were persecuted for it, yet were eventually entirely successful in their campaigns against, literally, the forces of unreason—much to humanity's benefit. One should not devalue a scientist who's fighting it out in the trenches. It is no less honorable to fight for truth than to discover it; fortunately Dawkins career encompasses both roles.There's no one else like Richard Dawkins in his fearlessness to defend science, reason, and Darwinian evolution. He's cringingly nerdy at times, but I wouldn't want him any other way. He stands as a driver of intellectual progress, and, if I may over-particularize the theory a bit, a prime example of what the process of evolution can create out of simple molecules given plenty of time, a little random variation, and a good helping of powerful non-random natural selection."
612,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7954544-julian,1,"what a dilettante. had to read this for class and it was the sloppiest writing i encountered all semester. Dawkins wants to make a claim for the defense of wonder in his Watchmaker analogy but wonder for him may only go so far as encountering a world consisting of only fact and artifact. This dogmatic assertion kind of puts a significant limiter on the line of questioning one may consider, much less wonder over. What is apparent here is that William Paley's defense of design takes up the same sort of Extrincism that Dawkins employs and is likewise an insufficient notion of an Infinite, Transcendent, All-Knowing, Creator. Basically, Dawkins and Paley are the same sort of Dualists. Dawkins just assigns agency to a different cause than Paley does. So Dawkins can write off the whole as of no interest what-so-ever. Wholes are only in service to the lowest unit of selection, (which just so happens to come down to the gene). But Dawkins assigns genes as as the almost magical driver for biology, anchoring the gene to all sorts of ""just-so"" stories. If you're looking for the New Atheist with a scienc-y hat, who will say outlandish things and make accusations regarding all sorts of tribal biases and dogmas while pulling a nice sleight of hand in which he replaces those biases with the ones he prefers...I guess Dawkins is your man. On the other hand, if you're really interested in getting a grasp of how genetic biology actually works, I would suggest reading some one like Richard Lewontin, (an actual practicing evolutionary biologist rather than a celebrity provocateur). He is a bit more difficult to read, but hey, it's real science. Neither Dawkins nor Lewontin can answer the question ""how did we get here?"" and that is fine. The key here is knowing the limits that Dawkins is insisting on. Again, I just don't get how he can claim to be a defender of wonder and then consider all questions closed that do not go through his reading of what a gene is. Particularly, when a large portion of the field of geneticists tend to disagree with a lot of Dawkins more scienc-y assertions.Bottom line, It's really a stretch to assert ""hey look a gene, therefore no God!...or therefore, the gene is God...or agency...or uh."" Whatever, Dawkins. Knock yourself out. Science will laugh at you in a century or two."
613,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"The last two chapters took this text from a 4 to a 3 for me. The initial chapters provided a very good overview of how evolution works with particular emphasis on cumulative selection and mutation. The chapter on sexual selection was also quite good, although not quite as good as ""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. It all falls apart with a dreadful discussion on Taxonomy and continues to descend with a discussion about rival theories to evolution. Taxonomy involves how animals are grouped together into categories like mammal, etc. Dawkins discusses how evolution is the only proper way to group species, a fact that I agree with, but then goes on to describe several competing techniques and the reasons for why they are flawed. I really had to struggle through that chapter. The chapter on rival theories was curious in that it went to great lengths to dispel a couple of obscure rivals (Lamarckism and Mutationism), but dispelled creationism in a paragraph or two. Dawkins seems painfully aware of creationism throughout the text. I would really prefer to read a text on evolution that pretended that there was no such controversies. You cannot really prove that there was no creation to creationists. They are not listening to reason, so why even try. I want the nuts and bolts science behind evolution and not an argument. Dawkins did point out a fact that I did not think of though. If the Universe is in fact 6000 years old, then we would not be able to see stars that are over 6000 light years away which would significantly affect are view of the nigh time sky! Dawkins has a strange habit of writing numbers in long form instead of using scientific notation. Who wants to see a 1 with 3 or 4 lines of zeroes trailing it? The whole biomorph computer simulation was also quite dated and agonizing. There is enough in Dawkin's writing though to get me to try ""The Selfish Gene"". Hopefully that one will have more science."
614,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"To me this book provided the author a way to respond to what he most likely felt as an elegant and very moving argument against evolution by an 18th century theologian William Paley. That's how he derives the books title. But this book is not a tit for tat rebuttal to Paley's work. Instead the book is broken into chapters based on Dawkin's on reasoning behind why evolution is the best way to describe how we came to be here.Unfortunately, Dawkin's has an edge. He has all the observation of the scientific community at hisdisposal as well as the fruits science provides. Paley, or any honest believer in what is called creationism has one tome which is a collection of writings put together in the 11th century and based on 2000 year old writings of dubious consistency and application.This book is a great read for anyone who wants to understand Evolution. For the most part ignorance, incredulity, and groupthink get in the way. So, put those aside and prepare to go hmmmm.This book was excellent for showing what it's all about and putting what is known as evolution into perspective. I say 'known' because labels are just labels, and it's really the understanding of the phenomena observed that we try and get a grip on.Neat stuff: there is no randomness. A human eye just didn't appear. It took probably a mutation, a single-step event and than a series of iterative events that develop into what we have today. All of this is done in the main event. The main event is whether the individual/species can thrive or not.Life is a culling of branches - a lessening of diversity.For the science and inspiration the book is good.To use as a tool to argue with believers of ""an entity created it"" is impossible.The logic is faulty since they believe something created it - then what created the something?Anyways, feed your head."

Because I like this topic. Because it's an intelligent argument and there's a lot of interesting information in the book. Because it's one of those books that you kind of ""have"" to read.But GOD this is a tedious read. The hilarious irony is that Dawkins spends a good couple paragraphs talking about how while analogy is a good way to explain complicated concepts, but it is important not to become so crack brained as to use TOO many analogies. I AGREE!!! I guess his idea of a reasonable number of analogies is very different from mine. I felt like stopping at least a 100 times. Not because I disagree with things he is saying. Only that after his initial explanation, he goes on to press and push and provide another 5000 words on something that I ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME.Is he trying to ""persuade"" people about Darwinian evolution? I wish there was a short version of this where he just includes the first 100 words of each chapter.Anyway he's laying out his argument ""for"" in a way that a very boring school debate team would when arguing a case ""against""- First, define what we mean by ""evolution"" (not necessarily ""getting better"" but becoming more adapted (to the environment, predators, disease etc) and passing on more genes- Establish the concept of ""cumulative"" change vs. one-shot genetic change (build an eye by tiny incremental steps)- Lay out the case that this process took a LONG long time (more than the human concept of scale can easily grasp, but that we can compute)- Tiny probabilities may not be that tiny given enough time to occur...that's as far as I've got. As I said, very clearly laid out. I wish it wasn't as pedantic and boring as it ends up being...I will prevail..."
616,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148394-russell-ince,5,"Essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand how we got here. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining adaptive complexity and it becomes clear that Darwinian evolution is not only scientifically sound but also axiomatic: that which can survive does so, and that which cannot survive, does not! In the chapter entitled 'Doomed Rivals' Dawkins also discusses the scientific alternatives to Darwinian selection and demonstrates why they are flawed.He also shows how punctuated equilibrium, often vaunted by the media as problematic for Darwinists, is in fact perfectly compatible with the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. Indeed, in the fifth edition of 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote: “...the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”If anti-evolutionists like Rick Santorum et al. actually took the time to read popular science works such as this there would be no intelligent design movement.So often when one hears anti-evolutionists 'teaching the controversy' one wonders if they have even understood evolutionary theory at all. Mike Huckabee's comments that evolution is 'all about random selection' belies the common misunderstanding of the theory held by many.Dawkins demonstrates that evolution is the non-random accumulation of random mutations over staggeringly long periods of time; humans did not spring into existence directly from ape-like ancestors via a billion to one coin flip as many anti-evolutionists would have you believe."
617,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8383366-saby,5,"This was the second Richard Dawkins book that I read. I'd read `The selfish gene' a few months prior and it had created much chaos in my otherwise peaceful religious life. I'd never given evolution or atheism too much of thought until then. I followed this up with `The blind watchmaker' just to see if the pattern of rational thought that was so evident in Dawkins' narrative was sustained. And it was. While `The Selfish Gene' will always be my favourite Dawkins (even though I eventually remained a believer despite it), `The Blind watchmaker' comes a close second. This is popular biological science writing at its best. The narrative style is very involving and the arguments are compelling. Using simple language and excellent case studies, Dawkins not only manages to explain complicated concepts of evolution in very simple language markedly devoid of jargon, he draws his reader into the discussion on evolution, presents `evidences',and engages the reader in drawing conclusions and making inferences that support the idea that life EVOLVED and was not CREATED. Dawkins explains how evolution can generate complexity and hence life and diversity, implying that `creation' does not imply the existence of a creator. His argument counters William Paleys famous argument that just as the function and complexity of a watch implies a watch-maker, the function and complexity of the universe implies the existence of a universe-maker.A must-read for so many reasons that I won't bother to list them here. Just get hold of a copy and read it. You may or may not be convinced by his argument but you'll love his style and the case studies... among so many other things."
618,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,2,"I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins but dear, oh dear, he does go on sometimes! The problem is not with what he has to say, but his belief that people can't understand something explained once. So you can have a simple concept explained every which way and you find yourself wanting to scream 'Get on with it!'. To find the same thing repeated again, and again, in separate parts of the book gets very tedious. (Not as tedious as the repetition in The God Delusion, but that was in a class of its own!) If he needs to refer back to a concept or explanation, he doesn't just refer back to it, he goes through the whole damn thing again!I started to read the book when it was first published and never finished. I did this time, but know why I didn't the first. I got to around where I finished last time and found I was saying under my breath: 'Please, please, don't say again ""At the risk of repeating myself...""; you are, and please, please stop. I'm a busy man.' Speed reading saved the day.He is also a little careless in how he demolishes people who he thinks hold eroneous opinions; there were several non-sequiturs in his arguments, even though his conclusions were correct. It seems he gets a little wound-up and doesn't edit out his worst excesses at the proof reading stage! The book is now very dated. It is past its sell-by date and it's worth putting your time into something else on the subject of Evolution; I can recommend the Selfish Gene; although published earlier than The Blind Watchmaker, it is still as relevant as when it was written."
619,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,3,"The reason I liked much of this book is because it's not (really) a science book. It is a book of philosophy. Sure, there are bits of science involved, and every now and then Dawkins gets too involved in the specifics of the radar systems of bats or the replication of crystals, but at its heart, this is a book of thought experiments and incisively constructed philosophical arguments. It called me back to so much of what I loved in my college philosophy classes, things I would ruminate over for hours and ruin family dinners with: Paley's watchmaker analogy, monkeys with typewriters, what it's like to be a bat, etc. My point is that (most of) this is not a dry book filled with statistics and biological descriptions of arcane animals—the way I imagine most evolution books to be. It is a well formulated argument about a subject for which Dawkins obviously cares deeply.The first quarter of the book is by far the most interesting part. After that, you have to muddle through a lot of tedium. But that first quarter is when you get to think about the big picture and all of the thought experiments with the intriguing names and you feel like you're really using your noodle. In the latter parts, you're still using your noodle (or else you're not reading it right), but it's just not quite as fun. But that's coming from someone who thinks all nonfiction books should be 200 pages long."
620,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324880-saski,3,"I stare at this book every time I climb the stairs, taunting me to read it. I really had planned to, until I started catching documentaries featuring the author. Not that Dawkins and my beliefs are that far off. If I heard his statements in a neutral tone I would probably assume someone had picked my brain. But his intonation is so...demeaning, I truly have trouble listening to him.Then I read Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Annoying! (but you can read my review.) He kept telling us what Dawkins said a decade before, in The Blind Watchmaker. It didn't ring true. I decided I had to see for myself.The book isn't nearly as irritating as his documentaries. Either that or he has gotten totally fed up in the last 25 years or so. I can't say I blame him. I just wish he would be more polite about it. I have to say I'm not quite sure what Behe's complaints are. Behe has all these questions that he says Dawkins brings up but doesn't answer, not even an 'I don't know yet'. Instead he claims Dawkins just ignores the questions. In my reading Dawkins answers exactly the questions Behe asks for, despite the fact that Dawkins wrote this book a decade before Behe wrote his. I ended by suspecting that Behe hadn't actually read the book he was attacking.If you can only read one of the two, choose Dawkins. Behe just embarrasses himself."
621,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1221976-bernie,5,"Just finished. I'd already read ""The Selfish Gene,"" so this covered some similar ground but in more depth. As an intelligent nonscientist, I found it a good introduction to a modern understanding of evolution, mostly accessible, though a bit dense in a few sections.As a refutation of Creationism or ""Intelligent Design"", the book is pretty much overkill, since ""Intelligent Design"" is an inherently absurd argument that negates with its assumed premise the very thing it sets out to prove (that anything complex, such as the human eye, must have been master-designed by some entity [which, of course, must be wondrously complex itself in order to effect such a master design:]). Dawkins sums it up thus:""If we want to postulate a deity capable of engineering all the organized complexity in the world, either instantaneously or by guiding evolution, that deity must already have been vastly complex in the first place. The creationist, whether a naive Bible-thumper or an educated bishop, simply postulates an already existing being of prodigious intelligence and complexity. If we are going to allow ourselves the luxury of postulating organized complexity without offering an explanation, we might as well make a job of it and simply postulate the existence of life as we know it."""

I bought this book not long after it was published, and for some reason it was relegated to an obscure bookshelf until recently. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. This has to be the best-written and most easily understood book I've seen on the complex subject of evolution. Though many of the facts are dated by now (the way he describes the computer he used for his simulations of evolution brought back memories of my far-off youth), the arguments he makes are as valid today as when first written. In fact, if anything, subsequent research has confirmed many of the speculations made in the book. Highly recommended."
623,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"Classic Dawkins, but less powerful a thesis than Selfish Gene or God Delusion.In this book, Dawkins takes on the arduous task of countering supposed arguments against Darwinism.He takes on Punctuated Equilibrium, Saltation, Gradualism, Creationism, etc.He makes good philosophical arguments supported by sturdy biological facts.Since he's dismissing mostly fringe elements, this book is more empowering than enlightening.Worth a read if you're a fan of Dawkins."

626,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"This book has been on my TBR pile for a while, but I finally picked it up as my bedside book and quickly got hooked. Even though it’s a non-fiction science book about evolution, and even though it gets kind of dry times, it was a delight.Of course, it felt a little outdated at times because Dawkins talked about some computer software he’d created which used a 1989 Apple Macintosh, but it was only the technology that was old. The concepts themselves still hold up today, and while it’s hard for me to pinpoint any specific part of the book that stood out to me, I do feel as though my understanding of evolution as a whole has been dramatically improved.That’s because Dawkins basically takes all of the arguments against evolution and systematically debunks them, in the same way that he railed against religion in The God Delusion. The Blind Watchmaker is used as an analogy for the way that evolution can build complex physical mechanisms without requiring a designer. So in evolutionary terms, if a watch was a living animal then it could evolve piece by piece over time without requiring a watchmaker (such as an omnipotent god) to design it.For example, some people will point to eyes and say that you can’t have half an eye and therefore they must have been designed. Dawkins points out that that’s not how eyes developed. It’s easy to see how just having the ability to tell the difference between light and darkness, for example, could make a big difference to an animal’s survival rates. And if the animal is more likely to survive then it’s more likely to pass its genes on.It’s all fascinating stuff, but it’s not necessarily easy reading. It’s the kind of book that forces you to think, but I like books like that and I’m looking forward to continuing to read through Dawkins’ back catalogue. I always learn something new from his books."
627,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84134671-fabio-brady,4,"Dawkins delves into the details to give the reader a more modern understanding and well-rounded overview of Evolution by Natural Selection.The author asserts that the designer of life is a mindless automatic process, the Blind Watchmaker (evolution), that guides species to adaptive complexity. Unveiled in this book is the underlying mechanisms of evolution, the constructive force of natural selection and the genetics of mutations.Dawkins brings things to a close by dispelling rival theories, such as Lamarckism, using convincing armchair analysis and brings the reader to a conclusion that the gradual evolution of species is the only theory ""capable of explaining the existence of organised complexity"".This is an intellectually stimulating read."
628,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533479-andre,3,"Good:* Answered the question about how is it possible that a complicated being like human could exist due to evolution and without requiring any kind of divine intervention. The answers: a very long time (the earth is 4.6 billion years old), evolution is not random - it's directed because it punishes failure with extinction and rewards success with survival, and there are multiple different solutions (our current form is not the only viable form).Bad:* The book answers too many stupid claims made by stupid people who are so stupid that they don't know that they are stupid. This makes the book longer and slower than it needs to be."
629,0141026162,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62086210-sabbir-saadat,4,"Another master class from Dr. Dawkins. Towards the end of the book, he had to give some limelight to the various schools of thought such as mutationists, punctualists, gradualists within the evolutionary scientists as well as vehement anti-evolutionists to rebut them, which kinda smudged the story-telling quality that I enjoyed at the beginning and the middle. But then again, he had to! As Dr. Dawkins himself put it, ""Science is difficult, but it is worth it"". Often the difficult part comes in the form of debates with people who don't agree with your neat picture of a certain theory. You cannot ignore them away as utter nonsense. "
