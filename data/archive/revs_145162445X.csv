0,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
1,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
2,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
3,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else.

4,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
5,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
6,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

8,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
9,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
10,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
11,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
12,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
13,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."
14,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873525-alex-j-o-connor,0,"A great book outlining the history of cosmology. I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
15,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
16,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
17,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
18,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
19,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
20,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
21,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
22,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

24,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
25,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

26,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
27,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
28,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
29,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.
"
30,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
31,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
32,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
33,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else.

34,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
35,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
36,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

38,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
39,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
40,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
41,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
42,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
43,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."
44,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873525-alex-j-o-connor,0,"A great book outlining the history of cosmology. I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
45,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
46,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
47,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
48,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
49,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
50,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
51,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
52,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

Hell, I'm an engineer, and it got heady for me. But it was a fun serious read, and I wouldn't mind reading other things penned by Krauss.UPDATE: I wouldn't feel good leaving this review here without following up with this link to some recent allegations.

54,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
55,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

56,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
57,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
58,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
59,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.
"
60,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
61,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
62,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
63,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else.

64,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
65,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
66,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

68,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
69,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
70,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
71,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
72,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
73,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."
74,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873525-alex-j-o-connor,0,"A great book outlining the history of cosmology. I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
75,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
76,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
77,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
78,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
79,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
80,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
81,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
82,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

Hell, I'm an engineer, and it got heady for me. But it was a fun serious read, and I wouldn't mind reading other things penned by Krauss.UPDATE: I wouldn't feel good leaving this review here without following up with this link to some recent allegations. ASU, where he is a tenured professor, has put him on paid leaveLawrence Krauss responds."
84,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
85,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

86,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
87,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
88,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
89,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.
"
90,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
91,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
92,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
93,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else.

If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
95,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
96,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

98,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
99,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
100,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
101,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
102,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
103,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."

I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
105,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
106,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
107,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
108,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
109,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
110,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
111,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
112,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

Hell, I'm an engineer, and it got heady for me. But it was a fun serious read, and I wouldn't mind reading other things penned by Krauss.UPDATE: I wouldn't feel good leaving this review here without following up with this link to some recent allegations.

114,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
115,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

"
117,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
118,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
119,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.
"
120,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
121,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
122,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
123,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else.

124,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
125,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
126,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

128,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
129,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
130,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
131,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
132,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
133,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."

I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
135,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
136,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
137,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
138,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
139,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
140,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
141,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
142,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

Hell, I'm an engineer, and it got heady for me. But it was a fun serious read, and I wouldn't mind reading other things penned by Krauss.UPDATE: I wouldn't feel good leaving this review here without following up with this link to some recent allegations.

144,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
145,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.  "
146,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
147,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
148,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
149,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.
"
150,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
151,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
152,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
153,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else.

154,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
155,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""

But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

I learned so much and admire the author for providing a book that is accessible and enjoyable to the masses. This book lived up to my expectations. Fascinating topics in the hands of a master results in a captivating book. This is how science books should be written. I canât recommend this book enough! "
158,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
159,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
160,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
161,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
162,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
163,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."
164,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873525-alex-j-o-connor,0,"A great book outlining the history of cosmology. I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
165,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
166,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
167,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
168,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
169,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
170,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
171,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
172,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this.

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

Hell, I'm an engineer, and it got heady for me.

174,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
175,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

176,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
177,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
178,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
179,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.
"
180,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
181,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
182,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
183,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else. "
184,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
185,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
186,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

I learned so much and admire the author for providing a book that is accessible and enjoyable to the masses. This book lived up to my expectations. Fascinating topics in the hands of a master results in a captivating book. This is how science books should be written. I canât recommend this book enough! "
188,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
189,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
190,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
191,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
192,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
193,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."
194,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873525-alex-j-o-connor,0,"A great book outlining the history of cosmology. I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
195,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
196,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
197,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
198,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
199,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
200,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
201,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
202,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

Hell, I'm an engineer, and it got heady for me. But it was a fun serious read, and I wouldn't mind reading other things penned by Krauss.UPDATE: I wouldn't feel good leaving this review here without following up with this link to some recent allegations.

204,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
205,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

206,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
207,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
208,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
209,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.
"
210,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
211,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
212,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
213,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else. "
214,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
215,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
216,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

218,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
219,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
220,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
221,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
222,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
223,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."
224,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873525-alex-j-o-connor,0,"A great book outlining the history of cosmology. I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
225,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
226,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
227,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
228,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
229,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
230,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
231,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
232,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

234,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
235,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

236,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
237,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
238,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
239,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.
